            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Began this Tranſlation in the Circumſtances of an uncomfortable old Age and ruined For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, brought upon me, rather by publick Calamity than private Vice, or domeſtick Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality. And I undertook it to divert the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly hours, ariſing from the conſideration of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And as the intention was private, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt thought of making it publick; ſo I judged it every way beſt not to exceed thoſe limits, till ſome, acquainted with the affairs of thoſe times, deſiring it might ſee the light, and I then conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Friendſhip that hath always been betwixt us, and that particular owning a ſhare in all my misfortunes, and a readineſs to be aſsiſtant to me in them: I thought it did of right belong to you; and that I might without vanity owne alſo ſo much of

publick, as to publiſh to whomſoever ſhall read this Book the true value and ſenſe I have of your Love and Kindneſs to me and mine, exerciſed with a Generoſity without many Examples.</p>
            <p>I therefore deſire you <hi>(Dear Brother)</hi> to accept it, not as that whereby you receive any thing but the Teſtimony of the Reſpect I bear you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution I owe you; yet I preſume I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, if I promiſe you, that are a heedful Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that you ſhall find in it Reflections uſeful for the way you are in both of Court and Camp, and matter to give you occaſion to acknowledge, it may deſerve a place amongſt the beſt of Modern Writers, if not the firſt, unleſs it have received too much diſadvantage by the unskilfulneſs of the Interpreter. But I will not raiſe that expectation by ſo weak an Argument as mine own Judgment, but leaving it to yours, ſubſcribe my ſelf</p>

            <p>NEXT after Writing Books, Tranſlating them, and Printing thoſe Tranſlations, are the worſt offices we do the Publick. For as not many of the one deſerve the light; ſo the ſame propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt hold in the other. Yet, where the one and the other are exerciſed with Judgment, and in profitable and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subjects, they cannot want a juſt value among wiſe and ſober Men. For, though I confeſs, nothing hath of late ſo much thronged the Preſs as Romances and Plays, with things of a light and fanciful Nature, and that this very Book hath found difficulty to creep forth, as being not of that form; yet I dare aſſure thee, thou ſhalt find in it, if thou be Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick inclined, Truth in matter of Fact out-doing Fiction; if thou love Hiſtory, thou ſhalt find the beſt Ancient and Modern Hiſtorians emulated and imitated; Civil Wiſdom and Policy curiouſly obſerved; the Trade of War, if thy way be Martial, ſtrenuouſly carried on; Vices and Errours, Perſons and Actions civilly cenſured; Vertues ſet up on high to be the better ſeen; and the Common-wealth, from which this Hiſtory taketh its Name, in Difficulties wiſely deliberating, in Reſolutions vigorouſly acting; in making Treaties Cautious, in executing of them Faithful and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; ſparing in time of Peace; prodigal of their Treaſure in the neceſſary occaſions of War; and at all times puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Fraud in it equally with Rebellion: So that, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of thoſe Glaſſes, which ſhewed by reflection at the foot of one ſide of a Mountain what was done on the other, was famous for it, though but a Knack; why not this Author much more, who from behind the Mountain of Time repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to thy view, not only what hath been actually done in the buſie years treated of in this Hiſtory, but what were the ſecret Counſels, and who the Authors of them; and alſo by Reflection what will be done in the World till Ambition and the Paſſions of Men ſhall ceaſe and be no more. Thus, <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> though good Wine needs no Buſh; yet ſince ſophiſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is now ſo univerſal, I thought to give thee Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and leave it to be taſted by Thee.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Moſt Serene Prince,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have undertaken to write this Hiſtory, not out of any vain deſign to publiſh my own name, but by an impulſe not unworthy commendation, to eternize my duty to my Country, where it having pleaſed God to give me my birth, and make me partaker of its liberty, I have thought it a ſmall thing to dedicate to it the ſhort moments of my life, if I could not find out ſome way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to continue my obedience even after my death, and leave a monument to my fellow Citizens, and the World, of the famous actions and ſignal deſervings of ſo high and mighty a Common-wealth. This Work was begun amidſt the fatigue and labour of many other employments, and for the moſt part in Ambaſſies in Foreign Courts and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and would have run the hazard amidſt the diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the management thereof, of having been deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even as ſoon as it was conceived, if by ſtealing time from my reſt, and reſt from my ſelf, I had not taken pains to preſent it at laſt at the feet of your <hi>Serenity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your <hi>Serenity</hi> ought in juſtice to accept it becauſe you commanded it, and in your goodneſs to bear with it; and its faults may appear more innocent, and many of its defects excuſable, whilſt in place of that honeſt leiſure and quiet which ſtudy requires, I was obliged to ſuſpend my Pen, as often as my Country was pleaſed to require from me, in ſeveral occaſions, the uſufruit both of my life and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: I have taken Truth for my Guide, as being the ſoul of Hiſtory, and a duty which ought to be ſtipulated by every Writer with God and Man.</p>
            <p>This I may ſay, that I have not wanted courage to ſpeak
<pb facs="tcp:53750:5"/>
it, nor means to diſcern it. Becauſe, beſides the Writings of ſo many (though ſome not ſufficiently inſtructed in the knowledge of things, or free from paſſion, have preferred the ſparing of truth before ſilence;) the acceſs to Princes, the negotiating with Publick Miniſters, diſcourſe with thoſe who were the Actors of the things moſt remarkable, the view of ſituations and places, have fully informed me with what paſſed abroad; I have had means to be inſtructed at home, not only by the free acceſs to our publick Records, and the moſt ſecret Counſels, but becauſe they have been managed in a good part by my Anceſtors and Relations, and ſome of them by my ſelf. Nevertheleſs I have not ſuffered my ſelf to be defiled with partiality, but paſſing by the priviledge of venerable antiquity, which to a face of Truth hath another cloſely adjoining, that of Falſhood; I have choſen to expoſe my ſelf to tryal, and perhaps to reproof, and that I might render a teſtimony of more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to poſterity, to write of the preſent Age to the Age it ſelf.</p>
            <p>I know it is a ſacred thing to compoſe Hiſtories, and not to be undertaken but with an upright mind and undefiled hands; and that for that cauſe the memory of them was conſigned to the Temple, under the faithful cuſtody of the Chief Prieſts, as the witneſs or truſt of thoſe that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the treaſure of thoſe that ſhould come after, not to be handled but as a religious thing, and with great cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In ſum, the Hiſtorian taking to himſelf an abſolute Dictatorſhip, nay an authority more than humane, over times, perſons, and actions, governs fame, meaſures deſert, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates intentions, diſcloſes ſecrets, is, with an undiſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed arbitrement over Kings and People, the Judge of Ages paſt, and Maſter of thoſe to come, abſolves or puniſhes, deceives or inſtructs. Whence, not without reaſon, the Pen of Writers may be compared to that Lightning, which ſtriking out but one Letter from the Name, <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus,</hi> made him a God; becauſe praiſe is a thing ſo tender, that one daſh makes illuſtrious and a little blot infamous, and the cenſure of the world thereupon is ſo ſevere, that it either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrates to eternity or proſcribes to infamy. For my ſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:53750:5"/>
               <hi>Moſt Excellent Prince,</hi> I know not what elſe to wiſh, but that every one would take upon him to read this work with the ſame diſintereſt and innocent mind with which I have writ it, confining my confidence to this one thing, that the preſent Age will not be ſo unjuſt to me, nor ſo ungrateful to poſterity, as to deny me the opinion of ſincerity, and the merit of obedience.</p>
            <p>For the reſt, the Auguſt name of your Serenity, which will be one of the principal ſubjects of my enſuing labour, when I ſhall come to adorn it with the years made ſignal by your glorious Government, is choſen the Tutelar Deity of this firſt part, to that end the work may defended by the ſhadow of your protection at preſent, as it will in a little time be made famous by the ſplendour of your Heroick Virtues, which being acknowledged by this our Age for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar gifts from Heaven to our Country, will be reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in time to come, as Examples in a free Common-wealth of a great Patriot, and a greater Prince. I preſume not to inſert my private obſervances towards your Serenity, amidſt the publick conſiderations of my duty: I only implore a benign reflection of your powerful approbation, as a comfortable Ray of that fortune, with which your Sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Governing with happineſs and wiſdom, after glory got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the dangers of ſo long a War, ſhall confirm with Victory and Peace, perpetuity and ſecurity to our Country.</p>

            <p>THE Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> conſecrated from its very beginning to Religion and Liberty, had its proſperous birth in the fifth Age of our Redemption. If it may be ſaid, that the age of States is better meaſured by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than time, its Infancy laſted for many Ages, during which, with uncorrupted Laws and Manners, and the ſecurity of their ſcituation, they fruſtrated the fierce aſſaults of barbarous Nations, and the ambition of other Princes. The firſt time ſhe took up Arms, was in defence of Piety and Juſtice; afterwards they were imployed againſt thoſe, who envying their Liberty, went about to diſturb their Quiet. And ſo the <hi>Francks</hi> and <hi>Huns</hi> being repulſed in the inmoſt parts of their Chanels and Ports, ſhe began to be more conſidered, and the Government through the Concord of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and the Authority of the Laws, to ſettle and grow up into a more ſtrong complexion. Liberty was no ſooner ſecured, but there aroſe Conteſts about Empires. The firſt undertakings in that Age, were againſt the <hi>Dalmatians</hi> and <hi>Istrians.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Ancona,</hi> and others of the Sea-Coaſts were alſo conquered, ſo that having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with the price of Blood, the dominion of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, as a Patrimony, ſhe increaſed in Wealth and Power to ſuch a degree, that ſhe not only repulſed, but very often overcame the <hi>Hungarians, Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, Greeks, Normans,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and <hi>Genova,</hi> enriching her ſelf with their States and ſpoils. Her expeditions into the <hi>Holy-Land</hi> were
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53750:7"/>
very powerful, united with the <hi>Francks;</hi> ſhe deſtroyed the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Empire, and alone undertook the Defence of Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> III; with the ſucceſs of her Arms abroad, (a thing that ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens) ſhe rectified all things at home, and brought her ſelf to that Conſtitution, which at this Day we ſee her in; equally durable and wonderful. No body was able now to reſiſt her at Sea; and in the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Age of Chriſt ſhe impowred her ſelf with conſiderable additions at Land. She got <hi>Friuli, Padua, Verona,</hi> and <hi>Vincenza,</hi> with large Territories; and paſſing the <hi>Mineio,</hi> ſquaring her Empire, extended her Borders to the River <hi>Adda,</hi> and <hi>Po.</hi> She had <hi>Romagna</hi> under Protection, and <hi>Puglia</hi> in Mortgage. But as ſhe grew Great, others grew Envious; whereupon after the Year 1500. all the Princes of Chriſtendom, and ſome of them againſt the ſtile of their own Intereſt, united to reſtrain her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing Power. This was a terrible ſhock, the Deſtiny of the Common-wealth alone being expoſed to hazard againſt the Fortune of all <hi>Europe.</hi> But the Prudence of the Government, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of their Minds, the Faithfulneſs of the Common People, and the Reconciliation with <hi>France,</hi> extricated all their difficulties; Liberty in the cloſe remaining unviolated, and the Empire for the moſt part confirmed. But her State, which was to be looked at as the Baſis of all <hi>Italy,</hi> could not be in trouble without putting the whole Country into a Convulſion. Inſomuch that although the <hi>Venetians</hi> after the Peace of <hi>Bologn,</hi> ſaw themſelves in a Calm, the reſt lay for the moſt part under the ſlavery of Strangers.</p>
            <p>The Common-wealth at this time was incompaſſed by Sea, and by Land, with two great Powers; divided according to the four Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal points of the World, Eaſt and South with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and Weſt and North with the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fixed her thoughts in the Arts of Preſervation, and of Peace, watching upon what was fit for her and her Friends, and for her own, and common Liberty. The <hi>Turks</hi> gave her two great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques by Sea in the Years 1537, and 1570. carrying away rich and great ſpoils. But the famous Victory of <hi>Curzolary</hi> ſigned Peace for a long time, during which they ſtrengthned the Defence of their Empire, beautified their City, gave vigour to their Forces, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their Arſenals, and layed up a no ſmall Treaſure. She main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a very long quiet in <hi>Italy,</hi> and though the Wars betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> did for many Years diſturb it, ſhe notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved a conſtant neutrality. The whole Country ſetling afterward into a moſt Happy Peace, kept not without jealouſy by the Foreigners themſelves, the <hi>Venetians</hi> made it their buſineſs to preſerve that preſent tranquillity, ſometime diverting the ſtorm at the firſt appearance, and ſometimes, according to the occaſion, oppoſing themſelves with Declarations and Treaties. The War which hapned betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> in the beginning of this preſent Age, did not penetrate into <hi>Italy.</hi> Some ſtirs occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Intereſt of the <hi>Griſons</hi> were quieted. The differences riſen with Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth were terminated with increaſe of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53750:7"/>
reputation, and advantage for the Republick; and that thunder of War, which was threatned by <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, vaniſhed with his death. All things thus contributing to the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men nevertheleſs were not free from fear, leſt many diſguſts lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecretly in the hearts, and ſeveral deſigns in the minds of Princes, there would be a new Rupture, ſo ſoon as any occaſion or pretext for it did appear. And in that thought they were not long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, for in the brighteſt Serenity of this Peace, the blow hapned at unawares, with ſo much ſlaughter, and ſo many miſchiefs, that defiling <hi>Italy,</hi> it hath put <hi>Europe</hi> into confuſion.</p>
            <p>This ſhall be the ſubject, and firſt part of this work of mine; becauſe as the Intereſts of the Republick refer principally to thoſe two great powers of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> with whom it borders; ſo the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative ſhall be divided. And I will deſcribe in this, the moſt notable events which have troubled <hi>Italy;</hi> and in which the Republick hath aſſiſted with their Counſels, Arms, and Treaſures: And for the other part ſhall be reſerved the Memorials of its long and generous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. And becauſe <hi>Italy,</hi> being the heart of <hi>Europe,</hi> cannot ſuffer a ſhaking but the reſt muſt be moved, and have a feeling of it, you ſhall read herein connexed the Affairs and Actions of the chief Princes of the World, the Conduct and Maxims of their chief Miniſters, with the Revolutions of States, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other accidents, as make the Age no leſs Unhappy than Famous, and the Relation equally important.</p>
            <p>For the better knowledge of the things to follow, it is needful to look a little back: Princes, though Mortal, are the <hi>Genii</hi> of the World. The effects of their Counſels out-live their Lives, and are like the Stars, whoſe influences remain long, though they diſappear from our ſight. When <hi>Arragon</hi> in the Perſon of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Catholick was joined to <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and all the Kingdoms within the compaſs of <hi>Spain</hi> were in a manner united together, comprehending alſo the Iſlands of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and both the <hi>Sicilies,</hi> there was laid the Foundation of a vaſt Monarchy. Fortune, to ſecond the deſign with vaſt Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, about this time diſcovered a new World. The Provinces of <hi>Flanders</hi> fell afterwards in, changing only the Line of Blood, but without the leaſt alteration in the ſeries of their Maxims and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts. In <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, the Crowns of the <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and their great power were conjoined together. He neither wanted Wiſedom nor Fortune to eſtabliſh an Univerſal Hereditary Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy: but as all ages are for the moſt part barren of Princes of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſo his ſeemed as fruitful, having <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Solyman</hi> Emperour of <hi>Turky</hi> to oppoſe him; The firſt, his Peer in courage; the other equal, if not Superiour, in Power. <hi>Charles</hi> therefore thought it beſt to leave the hopes and means to his Succeſſors. <hi>Italy</hi> by reaſon of its ſcituation, Nobleneſs, Strength, Riches, and a certain fatality, which deſtines her to bear Rule, hath always been the firſt Object of great Conquerours; and <hi>Charles</hi> failed not to increaſe his Dominion thus, joining the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> and putting a foot into <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> But he quickly found, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53750:8"/>
every foot of ground coſt a Battel; That the Princes were impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the yoke, and Strangers were ready to aſſiſt: He therefore thinking the Counſel moſt ſafe to encompaſs her without, that ſo at laſt ſhe might fall inſenſibly into his hand, attempted to cajole <hi>Germany,</hi> and leave the Empire to his Son. The deſign failing him, and he from a religious conſideration, a ſatiety of Fortune, or from domeſtick Intereſts, betaking himſelf to a private life and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of having been ſo great, leaves to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, the hereditary Kingdoms of <hi>Spain,</hi> with their vaſt appurtenances. The Peace of <hi>Italy</hi> paſſed as in a myſtery and by tradition from Father to Son; who no leſs wiſe than great, applied his Ax to the root of that, which might moſt diſturb the deſign of his Monarchy. He employs therefore all his power againſt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but having conſumed Armies and Treaſure in vain, while he was diſtracted by the revolt in <hi>Holland,</hi> and although he had added <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> to <hi>Castile,</hi> and with it the increaſe of a vaſt power, yet at the end of a few years, he found ſufficiently his Credit, Money, and Strength weakned. He then makes trial of peaceable means, giving to the Provinces of <hi>Flanders</hi> remaining in their obedience (to the end to re-unite the reſt) a Prince of their own. He left <hi>France</hi> to the deſtiny of its domeſtick revolts; and <hi>Italy</hi> charmed with the delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Peace, and the opinion of their preſent felicity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> the third ſucceeded him, a young Prince, of ſingular Piety, but wholly unacquainted with Government, and contenting himſelf with the Royal dignity, left the power to his Council, Favourites and Miniſters. Theſe judged it neceſſary to go on in the ſame Maxims of Peace, becauſe in <hi>France</hi> they found <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, a formidable and vigilant King, who having gloriouſly made his paſſage through the jaws of an adverſe fortune, ſuffered not himſelf to be gulled by proſperity, but would be ready to diſturb, and prevent whatever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns they ſhould have againſt him. Truce was therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the United Provinces of the Low-Countries; and to divert the ſcourge of the French Arms from <hi>Italy,</hi> procuring the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to make Peace upon diſadvantageous terms, they thought it a great conqueſt, that they had ſhut out the <hi>French</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Alps.</hi> And now fixing their thoughts on thoſe advantages, which time and occaſion uſes to offer to thoſe in Power, ſilently extending themſelves by little and little, they got their limits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and their Kingdoms and Territories better united; and laſt of all under the title of Honour and Protection, holding dependent, and in a manner ſubject divers Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who being not able to reſiſt, and believing themſelves abandoned by the <hi>French,</hi> yielded to what they thought their advantage, or rather to neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. And ſo beſides the places in Mount <hi>Argentaro</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and <hi>Porto Longone</hi> in <hi>Elba,</hi> the <hi>Forte Fuentes,</hi> built in the entrance of the <hi>Valtelline,</hi> and Garriſons put into <hi>Final, Monaco, Piombino, Correggio,</hi> and other little Fiefs of the Empire, the Net was ſpread, and the deſign made publick. Theſe things going thus on, one by one, ſome by Negotiation, and ſome through the conjuncture of time,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53750:8"/>
(although they awakened jealous thoughts in ſome, yet they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not of importance to diſturb the Peace; under which, ſome not remembring, that one ring is not a Chain, yet a Chain is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of many rings,) thought themſelves ſecure, and others happy. But by the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, <hi>France</hi> falling into a long mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters judged the conjuncture fit to reap their advantages with Counſel, and with Arms. And to ſay truth, the occaſion in <hi>Italy</hi> ſeemed favourable; becauſe the <hi>French,</hi> as hath been ſaid, being excluded, and now fallen under the government of a Child, and of a Woman, and Miniſters divided in their private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, the Country was believed ſo low in courage and ſtrength, that if at any time ſtrangers in the attempt to ſubdue it, had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten great company, both People and the Princes themſelves, would now place their ſafety and greateſt glory in yielding their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Some by a pecuniary Intereſt were already dependent upon <hi>Spain;</hi> others by blood, and others by pretenſions. The Popes taken up in the care of Holy things, or diſtracted in the concerns of their own Family, ſide always with the ſtrongeſt, ſo that the ſafety and protection of <hi>Italy</hi> was now committed to the <hi>Venetians</hi> alone. Nevertheleſs it was judged, that they alſo would prefer Peace before all things, either from the experience of the hazards, and events of former Wars, or becauſe Monarchies being ſubject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious changes and accidents, it was believed, that time might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch ſucceſſes, from which they thought their Republick, as ſtanding upon a more ſure foundation, exempt, and free. But in this general Quiet and Peace of <hi>Europe,</hi> there wanting rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts than minds to diſturb <hi>Italy,</hi> it was abundantly ſupplied by the death of <hi>Francis Gonzague</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> hapned in the flower of his Age, about the laſt of <hi>October</hi> 1612.</p>
            <p>He left for poſterity to his Houſe <hi>Mary;</hi> yet at Nurſe, to the Eſtate, two Brothers, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> a Cardinal, and <hi>Vincenzo;</hi> and to <hi>Italy,</hi> a ſad ſeries of Calamities and Troubles. By his Marriage with <hi>Margarite,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> it was generally believed, that the Peace of <hi>Italy</hi> would have been eſtabliſhed, compoſing thereby the pretenſions of thoſe two Houſes upon <hi>Monferrat.</hi> They had their ancient Original from the very root of the ſucceſſion to that State from the <hi>Paleologhi</hi> and the <hi>Gonza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui,</hi> and after many litigious proceedings, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, as Soveraign of the Fief, did rather foment than extinguiſh them, by a certain ſentence whereby the poſſeſſion was adjudged to <hi>Mantua,</hi> leaving undecided to <hi>Savoy</hi> the right of certain donations of Lands; and of the Dowry of <hi>Blanche</hi> Wife to <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> which though it exceeded not 80 Thouſand Crowns, yet with the intereſt of a long time, came near to a Million. In the Marriage aforeſaid, it was ſtudiouſly endeavoured to ballance all Intereſts, beſides the Dowry in Money and Jewels, the Father ceding in favour of the Daughter and her Poſterity the Revenues of <hi>Monferrat;</hi> and there was a line to be drawn, which was to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the confines, much intangled with <hi>Piedmont,</hi> upon ſome lands
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53750:9"/>
whereof thoſe of the houſe of <hi>Gonzaghi</hi> having a right, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it and made a mutual exchange of ſeveral places for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon convenience and advantage. But the affections of Princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to be bound by thoſe Bonds, which among private men paſs for Sacred, deſigns ceaſed not, nor were pretenſions extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>For the Line, they could never find a point where to begin it, but that of the life of Duke <hi>Francis</hi> being cut, they fell back into diſcord, and the confuſion of their former Intereſts. <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhite,</hi> called the <hi>Infanta,</hi> according to the cuſtom of <hi>Spain,</hi> in regard of her Mother, Daughter of the Catholick King, <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, who in her young days was left a Widow in the houſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> retained very lively affections for that of her Father; whoſe max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims and ſence were ſo deep imprinted in her, that ſhe played that part which was moſt pleaſing to the <hi>Savoyards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carlo Emanuel</hi> was then Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who it may be ſaid, had with much virtue adorned, and as much ambition embroiled two Ages. He was born in the 61. year of the laſt, and with him at a birth, Generoſity, Courage, and the deſire of Dominion. In the 19. year of his Age he ſucceeded his Father in the Eſtate, important for its ſcituation, plentiful by its Fertility, and for its extent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, but not proportionable to his mind.</p>
            <p>Being invironed with two ſo great powers as are <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> he could not but know how difficult it would be to make conqueſts, and as impoſſible to keep them. Nevertheleſs the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>France</hi> having opened a way to the ſurpriſal of the Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat of <hi>Saluſſes,</hi> and other great attempts, he eſpouſed, together with the Daughter of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, a partiality to that Crown, and the Maxims thereof. But the aſſiſtance of his Father-in-Law (who had no mind to make him greater towards the Confines of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe</hi>) not being ſuch as hope and deſire had ſuggeſted to him, he at laſt concluding a Treaty with <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, more to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> than himſelf, adheres to <hi>France,</hi> and enters with <hi>Henry</hi> as a ſharer in theſe deſigns, which that great King upon firm foundations had laid againſt the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Monarchy. His treacherous and ſudden death diſcharges him, leaving <hi>Carlo</hi> in the grief of his loſt hopes, and in fear of the revenge of <hi>Spain;</hi> which nevertheleſs having pacified by ſundry means, and the Hoſtage of one of his Sons, ſince he had not been able to make his profit with the great Ones, he now purpoſes to diſturb his Neighbours of more moderate power. The death of his Son-in-Law gives him the occaſion, and on the firſt notice of it he diſpatches, as his Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour to <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Count <hi>Franciſco Marteningo,</hi> and afterwards the Marqueſs of <hi>Lucerna</hi> to conſole his Daughter. She then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes her ſelf with child, to ſuſpend a while the ſucceſſion of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> the Cardinal, and leave the Government fluctuant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. Soon after the Prince <hi>Vittorio Amadeo</hi> her elder Brother arrives, and at the ſame time the Count <hi>Guido di San Giorgio,</hi> a Subject by birth of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> but by diſcontent with his own Prince, becomes a near Confident of <hi>Carlos,</hi> was by frequent goings
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53750:9"/>
and comings, driving on a ſecret Treaty at <hi>Milan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Mine at laſt was ſprung, for <hi>Vittorio</hi> perſwades his Siſter, with her little Daughter, to return home to her Father, or at leaſt to retire to a neutral place, as might be <hi>Milan;</hi> and if in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Child not yet born, her going out of thoſe Countries were not approved, he inſinuated that there was <hi>Monferrat,</hi> where ſhe might remain with more decency. <hi>That it was not fit that a young Princeſs ſhould remain amidſt the ſaid memorials of her paſt contentments, and under the eye of the Cardinal her Kinſman, as young in years, as jealous of the Succeſſion. That the Daughter ought to go with the Mother: not to ſeparate the affections of Nature, and to bring her up with that tenderneſs, which is proper for a mothers care.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch appearances was hid a more ſecret myſtery; for as the Fief of <hi>Mantua</hi> did not admit to the Succeſſion any but Males, ſo by that of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> Women were not excluded. In <hi>Mary</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was conſidered the ſecurity of that important State, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Carlo</hi> deſired to have her in his power: For grant, that Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Right have excluded Women, when any of the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line is remaining of a degree never ſo remote; nevertheleſs if to his own right, he ſhould have been able to joyn that of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, there was no doubt, but it would have much ſtrengthened the cauſe. <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that well knew, what thoſe inſtances meant, defended himſelf with ſeveral conveniencies and excuſes. <hi>That the Dutcheſs could not ſtir from</hi> Mantua, <hi>while ſhe carried in her womb the pawn of the felicity of that State. That it was not the cuſtom, that the Princes of</hi> Gonzagui <hi>ſhould be born in any other place, than where they command. That his Niece much leſs ought not to be removed out of that houſe, where poſſibly Fortune deſigned her Heir and Miſtreſs. If the object of the</hi> Palace <hi>of</hi> Mantua <hi>were a place too ſad and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, others were not wanting, and particularly that of</hi> Goito, <hi>wherein to divertiſement was joyned ſafety and convenience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Carlo</hi>'s to the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who was <hi>John Mendoza,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Inoioſa,</hi> intimates, that that buſineſs was to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by the Authority of <hi>Spain. Was it fit that the Child, Niece of the King, ſhould be brought up by him, who was <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide, and Competitor of the Command; where ſhould this tender Pledge of the Fortune of</hi> Italy <hi>be better placed, than under the Royal care of him, who is the Arbiter of it? That the Child did poſſeſs in her ſelf the right of</hi> Monferrat, <hi>ſo near and important to the</hi> Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe. <hi>If ſhe ſhould carry it in Dowry to ſome troubleſom and unquiet Prince; and if, wanting Iſſue male, as from the Complection of the Princeſs was prognoſticated, the Line of</hi> Nivers, <hi>now naturalized in</hi> France, <hi>ſhould come to ſucceed, what would become of the Affairs of</hi> Italy, <hi>and the Authority, which without controul the King at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoys there?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons, which, as the Report went, were quickned with rich gifts, moved the Governour to ſpeed the Prince of <hi>Aſcoli</hi> with a great number of Souldiers, to demand with a high hand both the Child and the Mother; <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was aſtoniſhed betwixt wrath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53750:10"/>
and danger. It ſeemed a great matter, that the only Iſſue of that Family ſhould be raviſhed from its Fathers houſe. But on the other ſide, to the power and will of ſo great a Monarch there was no reſiſting. Nevertheleſs taking counſel ſuitable to his fear, and pretexts from the preſent ſtate of Affairs, he anſwers. <hi>That his Niece, being Niece to the Emperour, and Queen of</hi> France, <hi>he was not to diſpoſe of her alone. That he declined conteſt with his siſter-in-law about the Guardianſhip, and referred it to him who is Soveraign of the State.</hi> With this <hi>Aſcoli</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> depart, either reſpecting the name of ſo great Princes, or rather becauſe unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly meeting with a reluctancy in <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> things were not yet concerted and adjuſted to proceed further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> preſently gives notice to the Imperial Court, and into <hi>France,</hi> of this jealous accident, in which it appeared, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, liberty, and dignity of all was concerned, becauſe betwixt power and violence, there being no mean, but that of reaſon; if to will and intereſt right ſhould give place, nothing in the World would any longer be ſafe, and unviolated. <hi>Matthias</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> was now Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and his Counſels, as the World thought, governed by <hi>Melchior</hi> Cardinal <hi>Gleſelius,</hi> and ſuppoſed, that as the Prince, ſo the Miniſter was little inclined to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards:</hi> And therefore naturally abhorring all that was pleaſing to them, and holding it for a Maxime, that the ſhadow of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in <hi>Italy</hi> would more ſerve to oppreſs the Emperours, than augment it, the Emperour decrees, That the Tutelage of the Niece did belong to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> abſolving him from any defect of age, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Common Law; neither did the Queen Regent of <hi>France</hi> differ from that Judgment, and being angry at the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> declares her ſelf to maintain the Decree, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them to underſtand, that ſhe would not endure, that the Niece ſhould be removed from her Fathers houſe and State, not without ſome kind of threatning <hi>Carlo</hi> to reſent it, whenſoever he ſhould imploy Art or Force about it; and with this it was believed, that the deſigns of <hi>Savoy</hi> were for the preſent ſuppreſſed, and the thoughts of <hi>Spain</hi> laid aſide.</p>
            <p>All this was ſeconded by the Council of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving after the death of <hi>Franciſco</hi> ſent to <hi>Mantua,</hi> under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of private Affairs, <hi>Ferrante da Roſſi</hi> their General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, a great Confident of the <hi>Gonzagui,</hi> had charged him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the tendency of things, and the accidents thereupon. By this means <hi>Ferdinand</hi> held a ſtrict communication of all things with the Republick, and ſtill incouraged him not to bend under the weight and troubles of the new Government, to maintain his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and the Decorum of it, and to loſe no time to make uſe of his dexterity among the great Princes, and to procure with all his power the good offices, and aſſiſtances of his Allies, ſo to be able to make a counterbalance to <hi>Spain.</hi> The Senate alſo preſſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V. the Emperour, and the Crowns, to awaken neceſſary reflections for the diverting theſe calamities and imbroil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53750:10"/>
which mature Judgment foreſaw to be at hand. But <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet's</hi> ſuppoſed being with Child being now vaniſhed with time, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> above his Purple aſſumes the Title and Power of Duke, and at the ſame time the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> appears at <hi>Goito</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away his Siſter, and his Niece, now the pretext of her being with Child ceaſed. There was there beſides, <hi>Iſabella</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Modena,</hi> only Siſter of <hi>Margaret.</hi> And here by artifices and fears <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was overcome to be content, that, his Siſter-in-law reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her ſelf to <hi>Modena,</hi> her Daughter ſhould be carried thither alſo, with ſolemn promiſes, that ſhe ſhould be ſent back to <hi>Mantua,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>Margaret</hi> ſhould have a mind to return into <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Concert was no ſooner divulged, but <hi>France</hi> in particular aſcribing the Dukes conſent to his own inexperience, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his Miniſters, it was remonſtrated to him, to how many hazards he expoſed that only Child, and to how many croſs intereſts he abandoned the Family. <hi>What was the Duke of</hi> Modena <hi>able to do againſt the artifices of</hi> Carlos, <hi>or the commanding power of</hi> Inoioſa? <hi>He ſhould have conſidered, that by the Succeſſion, if God ſhould inrich her with Poſterity, there would remain betwixt</hi> Mary <hi>and her Sons divided hopes, pretenſions, and deſigns. Ferdinand,</hi> acknowledging all to be truth, afflicted himſelf; but taken at his word, knew not how to recal it, when <hi>Caeſar</hi> Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> conſidering the weight of the Charge truſted to him, that drew along with it the ſatisfaction of the Crowns, flips the knot, and refuſes it. <hi>Vittorio</hi> departs then with his Siſter only, and with them a ſharp thorn was pulled out of the heart and eyes of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> But they were no ſooner arrived at <hi>Milan,</hi> but the Governour diſpatches a Courrier to <hi>Mantua,</hi> to require the Princeſs to be delivered to her mother; who bringing nothing but the accuſtomed anſwers, he ſends thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Captain of his Guard, <hi>Diego Leiva,</hi> and to <hi>Modena, Camillo de la Torre,</hi> that by both the Dukes might be admoniſhed, the one to deliver the Child, and the other to receive her. He of <hi>Mantua</hi> denying his power to diſobey the Emperours Decree, ſends the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Diocaeſarea</hi> to <hi>Milan,</hi> to make his excuſe for it, with order alſo to go on to <hi>Vercelli</hi> to conſole <hi>Margaret,</hi> who lived there; and withal to inſinuate the project of marriage, which had been ſo often formerly ſpoken of, as the only means to confirm in the blood of <hi>Margaret</hi> the poſterity, quench the pretenſions about <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and unite affections.</p>
            <p>But as <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> taking counſel from his intereſt and the preſent Conjuncture, had not ſhewed himſelf averſe; ſo <hi>Carlos</hi> would never come to any reſolution, ſometimes alledging diſcontents, ſometimes requiring ſatisfactions, and at laſt declaring, that he would not again, in favour of a ſecond marriage, quit the right of <hi>Monferrat.</hi> He had his thoughts rather bent to eſpouſe his own intereſt with the Fortune of a War; and for that purpoſe, ſuperadding new preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the old, he requires the reſtitution of the Dowry of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> with the Jewels, not only which ſhe had brought, but thoſe that had been given her in honour of the marriage: all which by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53750:11"/>
the Cardinal Duke, were reſolutely denied.</p>
            <p>Amidſt theſe Negotiations, <hi>Carlos</hi> was tranſported to higher thoughts. And calling to Council at <hi>Vercelli</hi> his Sons and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, propoſes his diſguſts at the Duke of <hi>Mantuoe,</hi> the reaſons he had to reſent them, together with the opportunity of greatning himſelf; and layes forth the appearances, which flattered him to believe, that what with Negotiations, and his Army, all things would ſucceed well. <hi>Martinengo, Voghera,</hi> and <hi>Lucerna,</hi> his chief Counſellors, judging the deſigns to be greater than could be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with great paſſions ſhew their diſſent: and the firſt with ſo much freedom diſſwades, that he incurred diſpleaſure and diſtruſt; but <hi>Verua,</hi> and St. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> of which the one, having an Eſtate in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> deſired to bring it under the Dominion of his own Prince and Maſter, and the other being made odious to his natural Prince, affected to change him, ſeconded the inclinations of the Duke. His cuſtom was for the moſt part to conſult within himſelf, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve according to the dictate of his own prudence; which being the infallible Counſellor of the wiſeſt Princes, was very often in him defiled with the ſuggeſtions of ambition, always hazardous, ſeldom happy. Having ſome Troops on foot, part being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the League with <hi>France,</hi> part a Guard againſt the Jealouſie of <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſaw before his eyes a State expoſed, and diſarmed, which the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> could not defend, but with bewailing and complaints. He believed, that the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> either ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or ſlumbering in a profound Peace, would hardly be brought to awaken: That the <hi>Venetians,</hi> more conſiderate than the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his entertaining of a mutual confidence with them, were wont rather to tolerate things done, then approve the deſigns. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour had nothing remaining in <hi>Italy</hi> but the name, and for the two Crowns, he feared them not, the one having a minor King, and the other the Kingly Power afar off. The <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> diſarmed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided, was governed by <hi>Mendoza,</hi> his Confident, and little capable in matters of intricacy to play a wiſe part, or reſiſt force. It was true, that in <hi>Spain</hi> the Favourite, Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> ſhewed himſelf averſe to him; but he chiefly reflected, leſt the fear that he ſhould draw a <hi>French</hi> Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> in the diſtaſte of it, would render the natural weight of thoſe Counſels more grievous.</p>
            <p>In concluſion, he deliberates to give a blow at unawares; becauſe, when he ſhould have put himſelf in poſſeſſion of ſome part of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> before the minds of thoſe that were remote would be ſtirred, and the Forces of thoſe that were near could unite, and Princes in the darkneſs of the general Jealouſies could diſcern their proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, ſome time would ſpend; during which he hoped to find his ſecurity, and advantages; they well underſtanding him to be as active and nimble in Negotiations and Treaties, as they knew him wiſe and couragious in Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monferrat</hi> is a large Country, inriched with Cities, Villages, and People, equally fertile where it is extended into Plains, and where raiſed into frequent Hillocks. The Rivers, <hi>Po</hi> and <hi>Tanaro,</hi> water
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53750:11"/>
it, (beſides other leſſer rivulets) the latter in particular running through the midſt of it, gives to the part towards the Sea the name of the lower, and to the other, which on this ſide more amply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larges it ſelf, that of the upper. The Metropolis is <hi>Caſal,</hi> and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to it is, if I may ſo ſay, a narrow ſlip, belonging to the <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe.</hi> But on the ſide of <hi>Piedmont</hi> it extends it ſelf more fully, cleaving in ſunder, as it were, that State; and whereas in ſome place in runs inward even to the <hi>Alpes;</hi> at another it comes up cloſe to <hi>Turin;</hi> interrupts the Navigation of the River <hi>Po;</hi> cuts off Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: and if in one part it divides the Territories of <hi>Aſcoli</hi> and <hi>Vercelli,</hi> in another it doth almoſt encompaſs it. In effect, if the reaſons for conquering of it were to be taken from profit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had great motives to deſire the having of it. In <hi>Caſal</hi> the Duke of <hi>Vincenco</hi> had planted a ſtrong Cittadel, under pretext to ſecure it from the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> but with no leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to preſerve it from <hi>Spain,</hi> who having the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> in the middle betwixt <hi>Monferrat</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> obſcures much of that luſtre, which from States, otherwiſe ſo conſiderable, would accrue to the houſe of <hi>Gonzagha.</hi> There were no other places of ſtrength; the fidelity of the people, moſt inclined to the preſent Government, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as a ſufficient defence; and that Jealouſie much more, which being reciprocal betwixt the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> did not permit that the one or the other ſhould conſent to the Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Carlos</hi> with his aboveſaid deſigns going out of <hi>Vercelli</hi> in the ſilence of the night, having commanded that the Government of <hi>Chieraſcho</hi> ſhould at the ſame time attempt the Surpriſe of <hi>Alba,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Verua</hi> attacque <hi>Moncalvo,</hi> himſelf drew towards <hi>Trine;</hi> and there applying a <hi>Pettard,</hi> with the noiſe whereof the ſmall Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon taking the Alarm, and, together with ſome of the Inhabitants, putting themſelves in defence, the <hi>Pettardier</hi> with twelve others at the firſt Volly were killed. The Surpriſe vaniſhed, <hi>Carlo</hi> ſtops at <hi>Gabbiano,</hi> to hinder relief, expecting the reſt of his Troops and Cannon; at whoſe arrival, having firſt diſperſed 200 Foot, which <hi>Carlo de Roſſi,</hi> Governour of <hi>Caſal,</hi> had ſent through by-ways for its ſuccours, to the place in two days, not without a report, that the Count of St. <hi>George</hi> had before-hand with money and other inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions opened a breach. <hi>Alba</hi> was ſurprized without oppoſition, and the Caſtle for want of Proviſions rendred. At <hi>Moncalvo</hi> the Town quickly yielded, and was plundered: <hi>La Rocca,</hi> ſtrengthened with ſome relief, held out fifteen days, and in the attacque the Duke ſubſtituted St. <hi>Georgio</hi> in the place of <hi>Verua</hi> ſlain. With theſe three Poſts, running a line along the <hi>Tanaro</hi> and the <hi>Po, Carlo</hi> found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in poſſeſſion of a great part of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> in which, what with contributions, what with booty, he hoped to make his Army to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with eaſe. Upon this emergency, it is not credible how much the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> appeared moved, and the people themſelves amazed; becauſe, by reaſon of the long Peace, there remained but few that could remember the inſolence of the Militia, and the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Armies. The Diſcipline of War was turned into delight, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53750:12"/>
luxury. Theſe ſucceſſes now being increaſed by fame, and made greater by opinion, no diſcourſe was heard, but of ſo many Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes at one time, ſo many ſucceſſes almoſt in one night, the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a whole Country in a moment, and an Army of above twenty thouſand men was ſeen in the field, before it was known that there was any Levies made. The Princes, taking the true meaſure of ſuch an attempt, judged it of little continuance, nevertheleſs appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that the effect would be unquietneſs to the Neighbourhood, and diſturbance to all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> therefore in a ſerious manner exhorted <hi>Carlo</hi> to the moderation of more peaceable Counſels, <hi>viz. That the ſituation of his Country being the Guard of the Peace of</hi> Italy <hi>againſt ſtrangers from without, he ought not to diſturb it within: That it was but an ignoble acquiſition, and not to be preferred before common quiet: That he ſhould think of Intereſt, and of Glory alſo: That the greater Powers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to awaken, which would make themſelves Arbiters and Parties to the Peace, as well as to the War: And therefore if he took Arms at preſent out of courage or humour, ſuch accidents were like to follow, as would not give him leave to contain himſelf, nor to lay them down before he ſaw States in aſhes by one common flame, and that to begin in his own Countries: What reputation could be added to his perſon, famous for ſo many notable actions; or what happineſs to his Houſe, eſteemed no leſs for the largeneſs of his Territories, than for being adorned with the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of ſo many Princes? Therefore they conjured him not to leave to his Sons, to his Friends, to</hi> Italy, <hi>nay to all</hi> Europe, <hi>ſo lamentable an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of blood; but by a ſpeedy giving way to Accommodations and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, confirm, that wiſe Princes hold prudence by the hand in making Peace, and Generoſity in reſcuing injuries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such conſiderations came not much pleaſing to the Duke, who truſting in his fortune and dexterity, diſpatches his Confeſſor to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> to undeceive the Marqueſs, that the Biſhop of <hi>Diocaeſaria</hi> ſhould be Priſoner at <hi>Vercelli,</hi> a Report ſpread abroad upon keeping the Gates of the Town for ſome time, the better to cover the ſecret of the Surpriſes, and withal to inform him, what his pretended diſguſts, and the reaſons and fitneſs of his proceedings were. All this paſſed in publick, but in private with humble excuſes juſtifies, that he had not taken the Kings conſent in what he had done, and offered ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral projects to the Crown of great advantage, but ſuch as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeeming difficult, and at others ſpecious, perplexed <hi>Mendoſa;</hi> who, juſt as <hi>Carlo</hi> did imagine, knew not how to reſolve either for Peace or War. <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who under the protection of <hi>Spain</hi> thought himſelf ſecure, and from the conſideration of the Counſel of the Government of <hi>Milan,</hi> though admoniſhed by others to take heed of them, found himſelf diſarmed, was no leſs ſurprized in his mind, than in his <hi>Monferrat.</hi> He conſidered the Emperour and the <hi>French</hi> far remote; and if the one could aſſiſt no otherwiſe than in name, the other divided in their ends and counſels, would have been able to protect him rather with words than Arms. The friendſhip of <hi>Spain</hi> carried jealouſie with it; if offended, it made it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53750:12"/>
formidable to him. He knew the Pope was accuſtomed to imploy only his good offices: Therefore turning himſelf to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to whom no one thing could happen more grievous than the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of <hi>Italy,</hi> opens to them in filial confidence the ſtate of things, and his neceſſities.</p>
            <p>The Senate handled it as a conſult of great moment. Some, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to themſelves the novelty of War, the charge of Armies, and the cares attending buſineſſes of that weight, inclined rather to be ſpectators, than take part in them; ſaying, <hi>What hazard can the Republick apprehend from a War, which is not on its own Borders? But what War was that to be, which frighted only with the diſcourſe and name? the gain of a few places open and unfortified, being but a robbing the right which would be re-taken ſo ſoon as it came to the knowledge of the greater Princes: That there would not want Mediators in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the buſineſs: That the powerful Neighbours would ſtop the progreſs of the War; and that the Republick had hitherto placed her ſafety and glory in Peace, which had inriched and adorned her.</hi> It was reſolved notwithſtanding by that major power, to maintain the cauſe the moſt oppreſſed, both becauſe <hi>Mantua</hi> ſhould not be forced to precipitate himſelf into the protection of a more intereſſed aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that <hi>Savoy,</hi> finding that Duke aſſiſted, and deſpairing of further progreſs, ſhould be inclined to Peace. They ſent therefore to reſide at <hi>Mantua Antonio Maria Vincente,</hi> their Secretary, with money to raiſe and maintain 300 Foot for the Garriſon of <hi>Caſal.</hi> They afterwards had a mind to perſwade the Pope into the ſame counſels; but he excuſed himſelf, doubting leſt the example of his declaration ſhould draw along with it, that of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> for one ſide or other; contenting himſelf only fully to approve what the Senate did, and to lay foundations for a Mediation of Peace, diſpatching <hi>Innocentio de Maſſimi,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bertinaro,</hi> to <hi>Turin,</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> and to <hi>Milan,</hi> to the end, that, in order to it, the Crowns forbearing Arms, might exerciſe and improve that Authority, which they deſired the world ſhould take notice they had in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> haſtens to fortifie <hi>Caſal,</hi> and <hi>Carlo de Gonzague,</hi> Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> puts himſelf alſo into it; who caſually touching on the Coaſt of <hi>Genoa,</hi> ſent the Prince <hi>Vincenzo,</hi> his Brother, thither, who paſſing through <hi>Milan,</hi> remonſtrates to the Governour; <hi>How much the Authority of the King would be debaſed, if a neighbour State, not only under his protection, but ſecured by his own word, ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by a Prince, who aſpired to greater matters, and who, if he durſt at preſent in the face of the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Enſigns, reputed with their ſhadow alone ſufficient ſafeguards to thoſe that depended on them, poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of</hi> Monferrat, <hi>would not be long before he ſet on foot his known de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon the</hi> Milaneſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mendoza</hi> was wavering betwixt publick conſiderations, and his private affections; and <hi>Carlos Emanuel,</hi> to keep him in perplexities, making, as may be ſaid, a War of Wit with him; now ſending his Son the Prince <hi>Vittorio,</hi> then diſpatching Miniſters, and then again changing the perſons, all with various and vaſt projects, with preſſing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53750:13"/>
inſtances, excuſes, and ſubmiſſions becalmed and confounded him. His moſt ſpecial Offices conſiſted in Treaties, that he would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt his progreſs, offering to render all again upon the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe and ſatisfaction of his Rights. Sometimes he declared, that in the places taken by him, he would ſet up <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours; but would keep them by his own Garriſons. He gave out, that he would refer all his pretenſions to the Arbitrement of the moſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick King; but his chief bait was, to offer the Conqueſt of <hi>Caſal</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> contenting himſelf with the open Country, if the King would conſent to his keeping of <hi>Monferrat.</hi> The Governour was not in a condition to embrace ſuch offers, how ſpecious ſoever, becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the artifices of the Duke, who, before he could well conſider one, did ſtill, to confound his mind, propoſe another of more hard digeſtion; he knew, that being diſarmed, if he ſhould conſent to the Dukes Propoſitions, he left not only <hi>Monferrat</hi> as a prey, but the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> it ſelf expoſed; and that <hi>Carlo,</hi> either to conſerve his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, or to advance himſelf to greater deſigns, might with the ſame facility, either by calling in the <hi>French,</hi> or ſtirring up the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> have the opportunity to make uſe of the occaſion to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of that Country. For that cauſe, ſhewing himſelf in appearance ſevere, he intimates to him an entire reſtitution of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, believing that the Authority of that Monarchy would have been a Weapon of ſufficient ſtrength even without force. By the Pomp of the ſame, he incourages the Princes not to fear diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances in <hi>Italy:</hi> and in particular, <hi>Alphonſo della Queva,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Bedmar,</hi> King <hi>Philips</hi> Ambaſſador with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> aſſures them, that without noiſe or trouble one of the Dukes ſhould be reſtored, and the other chaſtiſed. <hi>That for maintaining the Peace of</hi> Italy, <hi>the intentions of the King did concur with theirs. That there was no cauſe to fear any body, or any thing to be troubled at, whilſt the Power of</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip <hi>was ſtill the ſame. That his goodneſs would not admit novelty or diſturbance in that Peace, which was ſo happily enjoyed under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Governour with various Arts fenced with the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> (who often repeated the inſtance of ſuccours) perſwading him to put himſelf into <hi>Caſal,</hi> to give courage with his preſence to thoſe Troops which he prepared for his aſſiſtance, and to ſpeak with him as he paſſed by. Others admoniſhed <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to the contrary, becauſe the Prince his Brother, being in <hi>Monferrat,</hi> it ſeemed not fit, that both ſhould go and expoſe themſelves, and be put in the power of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, leaving the Niece in <hi>Mantua</hi> open to any treachery or ſurpriſe. Yet to ſhew his reſpect to <hi>Inoioſa,</hi> which was only that to which he pretended, and to render that Civility, which <hi>Savoy</hi> had practiſed by ſo often ſending the Prince of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> his Son, he was willing to go to <hi>Milan;</hi> whence from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe he had with him, he brought away nothing but riddles, and dark ſayings, and returned to <hi>Mantua</hi> with a terrible jealouſie, that the Governour were already overcome by Intereſts, or affections of the Enemies Family.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:53750:13"/>
               <hi>Inoioſa,</hi> having in former times born Arms under <hi>Carlos</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and for a reward, having the Marquiſate of St. <hi>German</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him, profeſſed himſelf ſo ſtraitly obliged to him, that at his coming to <hi>Milan,</hi> before he entred on the Government, he had a deſire to ſpeak with him, and carried both Preſents and Favours. This confidence thus begun, was even to this preſent nouriſhed by the Duke, ſometimes with publick Offices, and then with means more ſecret. From whence, though in the Council of State diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the buſineſs, and the motion of Troops were carried on againſt him with ſome kind of ſharpneſs; yet it was well known, that there was a more ſecret Juncto of three perſons only, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents, which governed the mind of the Marqueſs, and ſweetned all. This made the Duke ſo confident, that, although ſome Troops, long in raiſing, were ſent to the Confines of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs over-run all <hi>Monferrat,</hi> laid it waſte with Sword and Fire, and devoured in his hopes the keeping of the reſt. All that therefore being inſufferable to him, which conteſted his pretenſions, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his vaſt deſigns, or diſcountenanced his taking up Arms, he could not bear, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould give aſſiſtance to the <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaghi.</hi> Provoked therefore with a vehement ſpight, he calls <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenzo Guſſoni,</hi> who reſided with him Ambaſſadour for the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and complaining to him of it, exhorted him to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of his Countries, becauſe, the people having an ill impreſſion of the aſſiſtance given againſt him, he could not aſſure him of that ſecurity in his Court, which the Law of Nations required to his Character. The Senate from thence conceiving, that the preſence of their Miniſter was diſliked by the Duke, or ſuſpected, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to depart. But the Duke having reſolved to ſet <hi>Italy</hi> on fire, that he might make his advantage of the ruines and aſhes, ambition and wrath blowing him up, ſeeing now the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army to face him, threatned to bring the <hi>French</hi> into its bowels; and when the Pope exhorted him to Peace, he proteſted to overflow the Country with Hereticks; and if the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould ſuccour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he boaſts that he would incite the <hi>Turks,</hi> and bring Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats into the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> propoſing to themſelves to make a War of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to regulate the Intereſts of the Princes with their Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the ſhew of their power by their Army, were not at all willing that any body elſe ſhould meddle with it. But the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour believing his Authority ſo much leſſened, as that of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> increaſed, deputed <hi>Franciſco di Caſtilione,</hi> that in his name he might bring things to a Treaty, admoniſh <hi>Carlo,</hi> and beſides inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to him the Imperial Ban, if laying down Arms, and reſtoring every thing, he ſhould not contain himſelf within more moderate bounds. <hi>Mendoza</hi> provoked by the general clamor, ſaw at laſt a neceſſity to arm: And thereupon diſtributing numerous Patents throughout <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> had in a little while a very gallant Army on foot.</p>
            <p>Neither was <hi>Carlo</hi> wanting to himſelf, but to his warlike Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53750:14"/>
interpoſes Treaty, offering to depoſite in the hand of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> his rights, and the places poſſeſſed; provided the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> might be brought to <hi>Milan,</hi> there to remain with her Mother. This had an aim to ſow Jealouſie betwixt <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard;</hi> becauſe as much as the Governour, knowing the advantage, and the <hi>Decorum</hi> of the Crown, adhered to it by Intereſt and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, ſo much it behoved the Duke for his own ſafety to abhor it. Neither did <hi>Caſtilione</hi> diſſent from it, who beſides a certain averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contracted as a Borderer, and of leſſer power, with the Lords of <hi>Mantua,</hi> though his Allies, for his private reſpects eaſily prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſatisfaction of <hi>Spain</hi> before the Emperours Commiſſion. A Writing then was drawn up in <hi>Milan,</hi> in which it was promiſed to <hi>Carlo,</hi> that the Child ſhould be brought into that City, not to be removed from thence, but with the approbation of the Emperour <hi>Matthias,</hi> and the conſent of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Uncle. Neither fell it out otherwiſe than the <hi>Savoyards</hi> had projected: for the Original being ſent with an expreſs Command to the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to ſign it, and without delay to execute it, he, encouraged by his friends with promiſes and counſels, reſolutely denies to do either; highly complaining, that the Governour with ſo much aſſumed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſhould diſpoſe of his Will, without his knowledge, and of the Blood of the Houſe of <hi>Gonzagha:</hi> whereupon their ſpirits im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittering, the Biſhop of <hi>Bertinoro</hi> endeavoured to ſweeten them with more mild propoſitions, inſinuating, that the places poſſeſſed ſhould be depoſited into the hands of the Pope, of the Emperour, and both the Crowns, and that to the end, that within the term of four months the pretenſions might be decided by the foreſaid Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or ſuch other, as the Parties ſhould chuſe.</p>
            <p>But this pleaſed neither of the Dukes, and leaſt of all the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who abhorred to admit of Companions to his King, either in the management of the Treaty, or of the War. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs embraces every propoſition, which might gain time and appearance, coolly fomenting that War, which in the beginning he might with reſolution alone have ſuppreſſed. Hereupon <hi>Carlo,</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him know his intention to ſend the eldeſt Prince into <hi>Spain,</hi> to the end that the Son might repreſent more lively to the King the Fathers reaſons, and the Succeſſor in his States might ſerve for a pledge of the obedience of the whole Houſe, though for all that he publickly denied to ſuſpend the Declarations againſt the Duke, to which he was ſollicited; yet he was willing by all means to let time ſpend. From ſuch proceedings the <hi>Venetians</hi> well underſtood, that Treaties would not be ſufficient to untye this knot, but that they muſt quickly have recourſe to the Sword. Therefore, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their reſolution, they arm themſelves, receiving into pay 5000 ſtranger Foot, ſtrengthening their Garriſon with the Trained<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and appointing ſeveral Deputies repreſenting the Authority of the State in the chiefeſt places. They ſent <hi>Antonio Priuli,</hi> Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier and Procurator of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> Proveditor General for the Land; but they entertained not that thought alone, becauſe from the Sea
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53750:14"/>
alſo the deſtiny of <hi>Italy</hi> malignantly ſcattered poyſonous ſeeds of future calamities.</p>
            <p>For underſtanding of which thing, to be ſpoken of on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is needful to take the relation from a higher beginning. It ſeems, that many States, in oppoſition perhaps to the natural Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on accompanying Empires, are exerciſed with ſome troubleſom Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or other, which being rather able to defeat, than overcome, continually provokes and infeſts. Such to the State of <hi>Venice</hi> ought to be termed the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi,</hi> whom not being able to extirpate by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, nor to bring under by force, though for the moſt part beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and as frequently puniſhed with the Ax or Halter, roſe up ſtill more bold and troubleſom. Where <hi>Iſtria</hi> cloſes alſo the Confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> lies the Gulf <hi>Flatanico,</hi> at this day called <hi>Quarnaro.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the abundance of Iſlands and Rocks, ſplitting as it were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent into pieces, the Sea in that boſom hath ſeveral entrances and Chanels, with ſo great uncertainty of navigation and winds, and with ſuch turnings, that if Nature have reſerved it for the ſepulchre of ſhipwracks, Pirates have made choice of it as a neſt for their thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. Thence even to <hi>Dalmatia</hi> runs a moſt dangerous ledge of Rocks and flats intermingled, nevertheleſs with divers places inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, as <hi>Fiume, Bucchari, Segna,</hi> and others belonging to <hi>Hungary,</hi> which were under the Dominion, or much rather under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Archduke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> Couſin to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Matthias.</hi> The oppoſite Iſlands are ſubject to the Republick. The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> having there their habitatoins at land, from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted the Sea; a people, if we look to their original, not ignoble, boaſting to derive themſelves from certain valiant men, who when the <hi>Turks</hi> became Maſters of the neighbouring Provinces, impatient of that <hi>Barbarians</hi> yoke, withdrew themſelves to live ſecure and free in the mountains; but it being difficult in the poverty of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, to preſerve the original nobleneſs of their blood, they became degenerate; and being tranſported from place to place, were at laſt by the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> received into <hi>Segna,</hi> to the end they might defend that Frontier from the <hi>Turks.</hi> The place was little, but by the ſituation very ſtrong. Many of the poorer ſort retiring thither, together with many baniſhed and fugitives out of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> it quickly became a receptacle for debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched people, that turned the Diſcipline of War into Thieveries, and inſtead of fighting with the <hi>Turks,</hi> when the Peace was made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to provoke him with Depredations and Incurſions. The complaints of many, that were ſpoiled and oppreſſed by them, cryed loud at the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port, whereupon the <hi>Turks</hi> threatned high to come with their own Forces, and an Army by Sea to drive them thence, and deſtroy them. They preſſed the Republick, to whom the Dominion and Cuſtody of the Sea belonged, to curb and puniſh them, and with a faſte becoming <hi>Barbarians,</hi> pretended to exact from all Chriſtendom the revenge of the faults of a few inſolent Pirates.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> nevertheleſs reſent it, ſometimes hearing they had paſſed over and violated their Confines, and at another, that they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53750:15"/>
had robbed their Iſlands, and Territories, at all times diſturbing Navigation, and ſpoiling their Ships. And for this, they complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> requiring remedy, and over and above remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating to the reſt of the Princes, how dear the ſpoil of theſe Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains would coſt, if the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port were provoked to Arms. But 'twas no eaſie matter to have it mended, reaſons laid before the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrian</hi> ſtill meeting with the oppoſition of private Intereſts, which protracting the buſineſs, the remedy was always promiſed, but never performed. The <hi>Venetians</hi> therefore declared, that they would not ſuffer ſuch an infamous ulcer in that boſom: whereupon they imploy their Arms to bridle and puniſh them, but with little ſucceſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in that Labyrinth of Sand and Sea, greater Ships were of no ſervice, and the leſſer were not always able to reſiſt ſurpriſes nor ſtorms. Gallies therefore were of uſe for the guard of the Chanels mouths, and Forts and Caſtles to ſhut the paſſages; Armed Barks gave chaſe, and as many as they could take, the Hangman diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt infamous puniſhments. The predictions were at laſt verified: For the <hi>Turks,</hi> irritated with ſo many vexations, broke out into a War in <hi>Hungary</hi> with the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> and for many years infeſted them with great uſury of ruines and blood. The imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> elſewhere hindered not, but that towards the <hi>Venetians</hi> they went on from injuries to further offences, forming a cauſe of War from that which hitherto ſeemed as it were matter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of exerciſe: kept in at Sea, they broke forth at Land into <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and leaving every where in the open Country inhumane marks of cruelty, they attempted alſo Towns fortified. Repulſed at <hi>Albona,</hi> they made their entry into <hi>Fianona;</hi> where giving all things to the ſpoil, they ſet up the Imperial Standard, and would have exacted an oath of fidelity from the Inhabitants; but within a while they left it, fearing to be attaqued there.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> not behind-hand with them, made an Inroad into the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Dominion; but they went not forward, as they might have done, out of the conſideration of the Intereſts of Chriſtendom, then ready to ſink in <hi>Hungary.</hi> The Emperour very much diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the clamours of theſe his people, orders the Archduke to remedy them, and he ſends to <hi>Segna, Joſepho</hi> Baron of <hi>Rabbata,</hi> who by puniſhing ſome, baniſhing others, and delivering up Fugitives to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> would quickly have pulled up the evil by the roots, if, he being killed by the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi,</hi> uncapable to ſuffer any ſtrict Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, if, I ſay, with the return of thoſe that had been baniſhed, and the impunity of ſo hainous an offence, the evil it ſelf had not been fomented. Whereupon the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> fall again to their depredations, violating in their paſſage againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Dominion of the Republick by Sea and by Land, and againſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, robbing without any diſtinction all ſorts of ſhipping. Guards being placed to keep them in, as if beſieged, the Emperour ſends to <hi>Segna</hi> the General of <hi>Croatia,</hi> who, during the ſix months he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, curbed the diſorder; but he being gone, and they at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they paſſed through the Territory of <hi>Sebenico</hi> to plunder
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53750:15"/>
               <hi>Scardona,</hi> a place belonging to the <hi>Turks,</hi> who thought themſelves ſo highly offended, that not being able to ſatiate themſelves in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerating the damages, and jealouſies that the Subjects of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick it ſelf had a hand in them, ſending a <hi>Chiaux</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſatisfaction, could hardly with all the reaſons they could give be appeaſed. The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> ſucceeded not, through the oppoſition of the Convoy, in the ſurpriſe of a Merchant Gally, which, with a rich Capital of Eaſtern Commodities, was ſailing from <hi>Spalato</hi> to <hi>Venice;</hi> but they took near <hi>Rovigno</hi> a Frigate with Letters and money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Republick. Siege by Sea was then laid more ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before <hi>Fiume, Bucchari,</hi> and <hi>Segna.</hi> Whereupon the General of <hi>Croatia</hi> returns into thoſe parts, making reſtitution of ſome things taken, and puniſhing ſome of the offenders; by which, together with the interpoſition beſides of ſeveral Princes, the Senate was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to cauſe the Siege to be withdrawn.</p>
            <p>But ſuch remedies giving time, rather than cure, to the evil, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> return to their former miſchiefs, and ravaging at Sea, the Siege was again laid; whereupon the Subjects of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who ſuffered much, making grievous complaints againſt the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> themſelves, he ſends two Commiſſaries, but to little purpoſe; for at the ſame time ſome of the baniſhed did not only infeſt the Sea, but entring <hi>Pola,</hi> by a certain opening in the Wall, plundered ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral houſes, and with the booty retired into <hi>Segna.</hi> Some part of it was reſtored, but afterwards by the Truce, concluded in <hi>Hungary,</hi> the <hi>Austrian</hi> Miniſters reſtraining with great care all attempts of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> they brake forth with more violence on the ſide of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> plundering ſeveral Veſſels in the Port of <hi>Veglia,</hi> and robbing at Sea all ſorts of ſhipping. The Pope himſelf complained of the damage he ſuffered in the Commerce of <hi>Ancona;</hi> whereupon the Commiſſioners were ſent by the Archduke, which condemned their Barks to be burnt; but the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> delivered them from the flames, in a manner, by force, ſpoiling ſome of the Iſlands, and in <hi>Istria</hi> it ſelf ſeeking the Territory of <hi>Barbana.</hi> They entred alſo into the Country of the <hi>Turk;</hi> but returning with a great booty, it was taken from them by certain <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies, with the death of many, and taking of others, which were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately hanged at the Sail-yards. But all chaſtiſement ſerved but to irritate them the more; and although Commiſſioners were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſent from the Archduke, yet plainly a connivence of his Miniſters appeared, receiving every where the Villains, and keeping the Booty. They took one of their Commanders, being Priſoner with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the reſt had a mind to attempt his reſcue by the arreſt of ſome chief Officer; which deſign failing at <hi>Rovigno,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Town had put it ſelf into a poſture of ſafety, plundering only certain Barks in the Port, they lighted afterwards at <hi>Baſca</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Girolamo Marcello</hi> Governour in the Iſland of <hi>Veglia,</hi> and carried him Priſoner into a certain Cave or Grotto near <hi>Segna.</hi> This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy could be no longer diſſembled, and the Republick much moved, complaining of it, the Archduke cauſed him to be ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53750:16"/>
ſending to <hi>Venice</hi> the Commander of <hi>Fiume</hi> to offer ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and reparations. But the Senate, who had obſerved that an offender was now and then puniſhed, but the fault not amended, would no more give ear to diſcourſes, nor ſlacken the Siege, which did greatly incommodate the <hi>Austrians,</hi> if the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooſted out of <hi>Segna,</hi> and the Sea-coaſt thereabouts.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe the Emperour <hi>Matthias,</hi> ſending for the Archduke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to court, to appeaſe the further exaſperation, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the buſineſs, wrought ſo much, that it was agreed betwixt <hi>Girolamo Soranzo</hi> Cavalier, Ambaſſadour for the Republick, and the Emperours Vice-Chancellor, that the Archduke ſhould paſs his promiſe to <hi>Matthias,</hi> to hinder the going forth of Ships, and to keep the Sea free from Pirates, to drive the unquiet <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> out of <hi>Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and to puniſh the guilty, forbidding all protection to them, and the <hi>Banditi</hi> of the Republick: And beſides this, to change the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Segna,</hi> and ſupply the place with a Garriſon of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Nation, that might for the future be able to bridle them. Of all this the Emperour gave the <hi>Venetians</hi> his faith, and they on the other ſide were to raiſe the Siege, and deliver three of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Priſoners.</p>
            <p>The Senate, as a gratification to the Emperour himſelf, embraced theſe conditions, the Priſoners were releaſed, and the Guards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. But ſlippery being the <hi>Faith</hi> which ſprings from Intereſt only, it was not long before they relapſed into the former miſchief; becauſe the Garriſon put into <hi>Segna,</hi> ſoon wanting pay, diſbanded in a moment; thoſe few driven away were re-admitted, and the ſhipping being left in their power, they returned to their piracy. It happened, that the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> returning from plundering of <hi>Trebig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Town above <hi>Castel-novo,</hi> with twenty Ships in Triumph; <hi>Felix Dobrovich</hi> a <hi>Venetian</hi> Commander with as many attacques them, taking three, and chaſing the reſt became maſter of a great Booty, and a conſiderable number of Priſoners. But they, not at all thereby diſcouraged, entring through the Territory of <hi>Sebenico</hi> into the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Dominion, carry away much Cattel, bringing them back in ſafety the ſame way they went, not without grievous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the <hi>Turks</hi> againſt the Republick it ſelf. The Republick report it to the Imperial Court, ſummoning the Emperour to the obſervance of the things promiſed, and that by the means of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin Nani,</hi> and <hi>Franciſco Contarini,</hi> Cavalieri, ſent Ambaſſadors ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary to congratulate with him his aſſumption to the Empire. But while the <hi>Venetians</hi> were buſied in this their complaint, the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> tranſcends all patience and remedy. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with ſix Barks in the night into <hi>Mandre,</hi> a Port of the Iſland of <hi>Pago;</hi> where, through the careleſneſs of the Guards betwixt ſleep and the ſecurity of their own Port, was the Galley of <hi>Chriſtofero Venie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> Vice-Admiral, ſoftly ſtealing upon her, ſurpriſed, killing as well him that ſlept, as him that offered to reſiſt. <hi>Lucretio Graviſi,</hi> one of the Marqueſſes of <hi>Pietra Peloſa,</hi> and many others, being made, one by one, to climb out of the Galley into the Ships, were killed with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53750:16"/>
barbarous inhumanity. Flinging the dead bodies into the Sea, the Galley was carried away, the Cannon diſ-imbarked at <hi>Segna,</hi> the ſpoil divided, and the action applauded by that barbarous Crew. Againſt <hi>Veniero,</hi> preſerved for greater torture, they afterward ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate their hatred with all poſſible ſcorn. He was butchered at a Feaſt, ſuffering with great conſtancy a death, which with all the rules of Barbariſm they ſtudied to make horrid to him, and terrible to all. His reins were no ſooner cut, but ripping up his breaſt, his heart was immediately roaſted, and devoured for a dainty; his blood ſpilled in bowls, or eaten with bread dipped in it; his head placed in the moſt perſpicuous place of the table, proverbiated and ſcorned. At the advice of ſuch atrocity, the City of <hi>Venice</hi> was horribly inflamed, it was no where related but with interruptions of aſtoniſhment, and fears, ſome raging at the affront, all were aſhamed of what had happened.</p>
            <p>The Kindred cryed loud for revenge, and all the people ſollicited for reſolutions and reſentments. But the Senate keeping themſelves to more conſiderate Councils, heard one, who, to provoke them, ſpoke to this purpoſe: <hi>How long ſhall theſe Robbers abuſe our ſlowneſs? Surely we have given a notable leſſon of prudence and patience. Fathers, you have here before you the diſmembred mangled body of</hi> Chriſtopher Veniero, <hi>here is his head cut off, and ſcorned, here drops his blood, here the careſſes of ſo many well deſerving Subjects are Suitors for the revenge. The</hi> Uſcocchi <hi>hitherto have ſpoiled the</hi> Turks <hi>Country, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated our Borders, over-run our Iſlands, diſordered</hi> Iſtria, <hi>diſturbed the Sea, and robbed our Ships. We have ſpread our nets, ſet up Gibbets, puniſhed the Pirates by our judicial Laws. Their inſolence notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grows greater. Our gentleneſs is too highly ſlighted. They at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent prey upon the honour and dignity of the Common-wealth; our chief Commanders are made their Priſoners; our Gallies are carried away; our Ports violated; the Sea defiled with the blood of our Citizens; our Subjects are made their Slaves, and baſely killed. Are the Children of this Country then born to be a laughing-ſtock to the</hi> Uſcocchi? <hi>or do they preſerve blood in their veins to no other purpoſe but to ſatiate their cruelty? what is become of the noble Spirits of our generous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors? Thoſe venerable Carcaſſes, that left us the Dominion of the Sea for a legitimate Inheritance, are ſenſible from their graves of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front. Thoſe that conquered the</hi> Adriatick <hi>Sea with their blood, will reproach our ſufferance to ſee it ſtained with infamy. The offence is done to the Soveraignty, and therefore belongs to us to reſent it like Princes. Private men have the right of ſpeaking, complaining, and ſhewing their duties; Princes are their own Judges, and from them is no appeal but to the moſt High God alone. Shall we yet ſtay to rouſe up our ſelves, till the</hi> Uſcocchi, <hi>who in their pride have under our eyes already run over</hi> Dalmatia, Quarnaro, <hi>and</hi> Iſtria, <hi>ſhall be entred into the never yet violated bowels of theſe Waters? Now they have taſted</hi> Patrician <hi>blood, who doubts but they feel a greater itch to cruelty and barbariſm? They muſt be forced by Arms, and we muſt ſeek theſe wild beaſts in their very Caves and Dens. Who ſhall ever take up Arms
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53750:17"/>
more juſtly, or who can exerciſe them with more Generoſity? We have hitherto been at a ſlow but great charge. The Fleet is numerous, and ready;</hi> Albania <hi>and</hi> Dalmatia <hi>will ſupply us with Souldiers. Nothing is wanting but to diſpoſe our minds to it, and unite our Forces. Being ſhut up every where, and invaded in ſeveral Quarters, they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained at laſt to receive the puniſhments due to ſo many horrible of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. If</hi> Ferdinand <hi>be innocent of their faults, he will abandon them to Juſtice; if conſenting to them, it will not be fit for us longer to bear it. But let us ſuppoſe him intereſted, and reſolved to maintain their defence; we ſhall ſtill be ſtronger both at Sea and at Land.</hi> Matthias, <hi>a juſt Prince, hath pawned his word and ſaith to us. But to ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unneceſſary cautions, every thing ſeems to aſſent. What is the Empire elſe but a vaſt Engine compoſed of ſo many pieces, that it either gives way, or falls to the ground before it moves united? The</hi> Auſtrians <hi>delude us, the</hi> Turks <hi>threaten us, and, if our Subjects are pleaſed with this our ſlackneſs, ſtrangers do ſcorn our ſufferance of the injuries. This is a Decree fatal to our Country; if this ignominy be not wiped out, it will be neceſſary to begin to forget the fact, and ſeek to hide it from poſterity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To a diſcourſe ſo full of heat, another anſwers more calmly: <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions themſelves have their periods, and being the adulterers, not the ſpouſes, of the mind, it is fit to repudiate and change them. Againſt the outrages of the</hi> Uſcocchi, <hi>who is there that hath not his mind moved with a juſt reſentment? The ſurpriſe of the Gally, the ſlaughter of the Captain, and the blood of ſo many beſides, hath with great reaſon ſtirred our affections. We have ſufficiently with tears, as private men, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the aſhes of our well deſerving Citizen. But here, as the Compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of the Republick, we are aſſembled to deliberate as Princes. For Gods ſake let maturity more than revenge preſide in our Council. Scorn and diſdain are a weak Weapon to him that wants prudence, or ſtrength. Who will burn his houſe to preſerve it from the inſult of Robbers? They will fall at laſt, as they have often done? The wickedeſt, I ſay, of the</hi> Uſcocchi <hi>will fall under the hand of the Hangman. Let us reſtrain their courſes, let us beſiege their Harbours, and that with a generous prudence and conſtancy, till no one ſuch poyſonous root remain unpluckt up. Let us yield no more to promiſes, or Treaties. Let us practiſe revenge befitting a Prince; and if the</hi> Auſtrians <hi>ſhall not apply more wholeſom remedies, let us procure it of our ſelves with a ſtrong hand, but in its proper ſeaſon. Shall we then begin to make War before we are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly armed? Or ſhall we at preſent divert our care, and applications from the affairs of</hi> Italy, <hi>to involve our ſelves with the</hi> Uſcocchi <hi>at Sea? Let us take them in their time. But if at preſent the Duke of</hi> Mantua <hi>be over-powered, if injuſtice triumph, and power prevail, what ſhall become of us, and the common Intereſts? It is an eaſie thing to make War in diſcourſe, and in the Market-place; but at Land, and at Sea how much blood is ſpilt, how much treaſure ſpent? Where ſhall we find the</hi> Uſcoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi <hi>to joyn equal Battel with them, whoſe Victories are wont to be gotten by ſurpriſe? Where ſhall we place a Siege, if their ſtrength conſiſt in running away? We have to do with a Coaſt without Ports, and with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53750:17"/>
Mountains impenetrable. They are protected by their ſituation, and by Princes; we have no cauſe as yet to be aſhamed; we have an Enemy (if a Crew of Thieves deſerve that name) that vexes, provokes, and inſults, and yet in an honourable way, like Souldiers, we know not where to find them, and fight with them. In ſome caſes there is nothing to be done, but to over-look and diſſemble, and, as we are wont in a whirlwind, to paſs through the troubleſom duſt with our eyes ſhut. With which Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with Arms, and with time, we ſhall at laſt overcome the</hi> Uſcocchi. <hi>But at preſent they deſerve not ſo much honour, as to be made the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Authors of a War, that will every where be talked of: A War which began with the</hi> Uſcocchi, <hi>will neceſſarily go on with the</hi> Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>and poſſibly end with the</hi> Turks.

            <p>By the conſideration of the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> the minds of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators were prevailed upon; to which bending their chief care, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a mean betwixt the publick good, and the opinion of the vulgar Common-people, they reſolve, that at preſent <hi>Philippo Paſqualigo,</hi> General of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> ſhould proſecute the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi,</hi> ſtraighten <hi>Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> by Sea, and increaſe his ſtrength with 20 armed Barks, a 1000 <hi>Albanian</hi> Foot, and 500 <hi>Croats.</hi> To <hi>Matthias</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> they cauſed vigorous complaints to be made, requiring the chaſtiſing of the offenders, the reſtitution of the Gally, the Cannon, and the Booty; and in <hi>Spain</hi> they made lively Remonſtrances of all that had hapned. And to ſay truth, the minds of men in both Courts at ſo bloody a ſtory appeared greatly moved. Nevertheleſs the Cannon was not rendred, nor the Gally; the firſt being diſpoſed of into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Forts, and the laſt running aſhore was beat to pieces by the Sea: Only by the Emperour three Commiſſioners were named, that they might meet with as many of the Republick in <hi>Fiume.</hi> But the Senate, that underſtood, delay was the thing aimed at, by ſuch longſom remedies in a buſineſs, whereof the World was witneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to admit of any Negotiation, till that were performed which was agreed at <hi>Vienna.</hi> For which the Commiſſioners having no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they retired from <hi>Fiume,</hi> whereupon the Siege continuing, and there happening ſuch accidents as more and more ſtirred mens minds, they quickly broke off the thoughts of Peace.</p>
            <p>The thing moſt minded now, was <hi>Monferrat;</hi> where <hi>Carlo</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill in poſſeſſion of what he had taken, while it was believed, that he would at leaſt have expected the arrival of the Prince in <hi>Spain,</hi> moves on a ſudden, and provoking Fortune, and haſtening his diſgrace, marches with his Army, leaving it doubtful, whether it would go towards <hi>Ponteſtura,</hi> or <hi>Nizza de la Paglia.</hi> Into the <hi>firſt,</hi> as neareſt to <hi>Caſal,</hi> were carefully ſent 400 Foot, and to procure them greater reſpect, they bore the Colours of <hi>Spain;</hi> whereupon the Duke marching on, falls upon the <hi>other,</hi> the Count of St. <hi>George</hi> ſpeeding before to inveſt it. The place being weak, and having ſcarce any Wall about it, had little other defence but the fidelity and valour of <hi>Manfrino Castiglione,</hi> a Gentleman of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53750:18"/>
who with ſome ſmall Garriſon commanded it. The <hi>Savoyards</hi> bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it from three places. The Governour on the other ſide exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed them with frequent Sallies, and making an example of the baſeneſs of ſome, who inclined to render it, gave time for its relief. <hi>Carlo,</hi> to hinder that which by way of the Sea might come from the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> or others, takes <hi>Altare,</hi> a place ſituate on the Confines of the <hi>Genoveſi.</hi> But the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> being not able to reſiſt the exclamations of thoſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and thoſe ſtinging Satyrs, with which he was jeered, diſpatches <hi>Antonio di Leva,</hi> Prince of <hi>Aſcoli,</hi> with 5000 Souldiers to joyn with the Prince <hi>Vincenzo,</hi> who waited for them with 3000 more. Their march was ſlow, as if <hi>Aſcoli</hi> would give time to have it rendred, hearkening to the Imperial Commiſſioners propoſitions for a ſuſpenſion of Arms for 15 days; but refuſed by thoſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Army at laſt came near to <hi>Nizza,</hi> which <hi>Manfrino</hi> defended beyond all belief. <hi>Carlo</hi> then having made uſe of all his art, publick and ſecret, to hinder <hi>Inoioſa</hi> from ſending in ſuccours, ſeeing him appear within his view, pretending reſpect to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours, retires. A Garriſon of the Kings preſently enters, and the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> having gained the point of Authority, neglects the recovery of what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, which with very much eaſe he might have done. The Prince of <hi>Aſcoli,</hi> withdrawing the Army, goes himſelf to <hi>Milan,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Mantua</hi> remained facing the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> not without ſome Skirmiſhes, and Factions; whereof that of the greateſt moment was, the <hi>Mantuans</hi> vain attempt upon <hi>Canelio,</hi> with the loſs of above 100 Souldiers. Hoſtility going on in this manner, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that wanted every day more and more aſſiſtance, ſends according to cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom <hi>Frederick Gonzagua</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> to return the Complement of his Succeſſion, and to give thanks withal for the ſuccours, which with a conſiderable ſum of money, for proviſion of Victuals, and Amuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>Caſal,</hi> had been liberally furniſhed. Beſides which <hi>Coſmo,</hi> grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> had reſolved to aſſiſt him with 2000 Foot, and 300 Horſe; but having demanded of the <hi>Genoveſe</hi> paſſage through their Country to ſend them into <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and afterwards of the Pope to get them at leaſt into <hi>Mantua,</hi> he found it every where ſhut, as well from the conſiderations of not declaring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as from the ſollicitations of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who loved not to ſee the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes aſſiſt one another, and ſo have a waking eye upon their own Intereſts; and therefore had endeavoured to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them by ſeveral reaſons. But <hi>Coſmo</hi> being thereby more infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to manifeſt himſelf a free Prince, and abhorring the example, that it ſhould not be lawful to aſſiſt his friends, and much more the conſequence, that all ought to depend upon one ſole Potentate, preſſeth the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> for paſſage; who yet at the inſtance of <hi>Inoioſa</hi> denies it; and Count <hi>Balthaſar Bia</hi> coming from <hi>Milan</hi> into <hi>Tuſcany</hi> attempts to diſſwade <hi>Coſmo</hi> from asking of it any further.</p>
            <p>But the Grand Duke, ſending the men appointed for the ſuccours under the Command of the Prince <hi>Franciſco,</hi> his Brother, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53750:18"/>
to them 10000 of his Country Militia, with ſix Cannons, to the Confines of the <hi>Modeneſe,</hi> where finding the paſſage of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſhut, and barricadoed, and no friendly inſtances for paſſage, receiving from the Duke <hi>Caeſars</hi> Souldiers no other anſwer but Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of ſhot, the <hi>Florentines</hi> reſolutely gave the aſſault, and forcing the defenders to give way, whether by force, or ſecret connivance of Duke <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf, gain the paſſage, taking their Quarters upon the <hi>Mantuan</hi> Territory; but thereby, and for the ſecurity of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals becoming burdenſom, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſends them back upon the firſt hopes of Peace. He hearkens upon this occaſion to a certain project of Marriage with a Princeſs of the Houſe of <hi>Medici,</hi> it being evident from what had happened, how advantagious it would be for the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to unite themſelves in the ſtricteſt bonds of correſpondence and affection for the leſſening that Authority, which Strangers arrogated to themſelves; for which purpoſe the great Duke alſo, though with warineſs, ſet on foot Propoſitions for Unions and Leagues; but all fell to the ground without effect, becauſe as to the Marriage, the Duke did not find himſelf ſo free from the dependence of <hi>Spain,</hi> as to be able as yet to reſolve it; neither would he quite break off the renewed Propoſitions of a new Alliance, which was ſuggeſted to him with the Houſe of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and for thoſe other Alliances, few of the Princes durſt hear the diſcourſe of them, much leſs owne them; and the <hi>Venetians</hi> themſelves in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture judged them rather advantagious and deſirable than poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or ſeaſonable. The ſenſe and judgment of Strangers upon the preſent Intereſts arrived now in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mary,</hi> Queen Regent of <hi>France,</hi> having her ſelf been much moved at the dangerous and diſadvantagious condition of the Houſe of <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zagha,</hi> declares to uphold it with Treaties and Arms. Nevertheleſs ſome of her chief Miniſters inclining to <hi>Savoy,</hi> and others not well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the <hi>Gonzaghi,</hi> brought it again into deliberation: <hi>That it would not be wiſely done of them in the time of a Minor King, by arming the Kingdom to put themſelves to the neceſſity of truſting Armies to the Command of the great Ones. That upon the Confines of</hi> Savoy <hi>no other could be imployed but</hi> Deſdiguieres, <hi>Governour of</hi> Dauphin, <hi>who by authority and credit, being reputed the Head of the</hi> Hugonots, <hi>would give ſo much more vigour to that Party, by how much the increaſe of reputation and power ſhould be given to him.</hi> They added, <hi>That it was impoſſible that both the Crowns ſhould amicably agree in one and the ſame affair of</hi> Italy; <hi>whereupon going about to reſtrain the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of</hi> Savoy, <hi>they might poſſibly meet with the power of</hi> Spain <hi>againſt them, and by one accident or other diſcompoſe the accompliſhment of thoſe reciprocal Marriages, which had been ſo lately concluded.</hi> This was enough to perſwade the Queen to imploy her authority rather than force; becauſe, beſides giving her ſelf to pleaſures, and a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Government rather than troubles, ſhe had in the Marriage of the King, her Son, with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and of her Daughter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> with <hi>Philip</hi> Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> placed the ſtrength of her authority; notwithſtanding that upon the publiſhing of that Treaty all Princes,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53750:19"/>
in amity with her, grew jealous, and the Genius it ſelf of the <hi>French</hi> Nation diſliked it. In favour therefore of her Kinſman <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſhe imploys nothing but good offices and intreaties in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> by which ſhe ſeemed rather wholly to refer the affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> to that Kings arbitrement, than any way aſſiſt the Duke.</p>
            <p>True it was, that in <hi>Madrid</hi> the Miniſters, conformable to the pondering Genius of that Nation, had made long and wiſe reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the whole emergency, and at laſt, not ſo much for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of <hi>France,</hi> and the inſtances of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> as for that ancient averſion of the Favourite to <hi>Carlo,</hi> the Secretary <hi>Vargas</hi> was diſpatched to <hi>Milan</hi> with a ſhort Order, but ſubſtantial, that <hi>Carlo</hi> ſhould reſtore all; and not doing it preſently, be conſtrained by Arms. <hi>Vittorio,</hi> who was landed in <hi>Catalogna,</hi> received a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand not to go forward till it ſhould firſt be known, whether his Father yielded obedience or no. Such was publiſhed to be the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>Vargas,</hi> and taken for a good providence to <hi>Italy,</hi> and magnified for the juſtice and uprightneſs of the Kings intentions. Yet ſome from the carriage of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, and from things ſubſequent, took upon them to judge, that there were more ſecret orders to make advantage of the conjuncture of affairs; but Princes alone having knowledge of the truth of ſuch ſecrets, the people can but gueſs at the counſels, and believe according to the events.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carlo,</hi> to divert the effect of ſo ſevere a Commiſſion, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to amuſe the Governour, offering (provided he might keep what he had gotten himſelf) his State and Forces to run the Kings For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune againſt whomſoever. In concluſion he offered to reſtore every thing, one place excepted to be kept as the pawn of his Rights, till the caſe ſhould be decided; but <hi>Inoioſa</hi> ſends to him <hi>Franciſco Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diglio</hi> General of the Artillery, a man formal, and nice in the points of Honour, who in few words, and with a ſevere ſuperciliouſneſs intimates to him an entire reſtitution, delivering Letters from the King directed to the Duke himſelf, by which in very conciſe terms he orders him to perform all that the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> ſhould preſcribe him. <hi>Carlo</hi> in the height of his ſpirit raged, being touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the very heart of his dignity; but forſaken of all, he could do no other but yield to the more powerful. Without giving a preciſe anſwer to <hi>Padiglio,</hi> he ſends Count <hi>Lovis Crivelli</hi> with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to the Governour which carried the appearance to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract time. They therefore being rejected, it was intimated to him anew, that he ſhould reſtore all, or the Prince of <hi>Aſcoli</hi> with the Army ſhould march to the Walls of <hi>Trin,</hi> and, in caſe of reſiſtance, the Governour would tranſport himſelf thither, reſolving to hang every one who ſhould dare to help to defend it. <hi>Carlo</hi> offers then to reſign; but about the reception there aroſe a Punctiglio betwixt the Prince <hi>di Caſtiglione,</hi> and the Governour, each inſiſting that the ſole name of his Maſter might be uſed; but the one having nothing but authority, and the other the power, it was agreed, that both ſhould concur. <hi>Trin</hi> in conſequence was delivered to <hi>Caſtiglione;</hi> and <hi>Alba</hi> to <hi>Aſcoli,</hi> and <hi>Moncalvo</hi> to <hi>John Bravo,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colonel,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53750:19"/>
and were all preſently put into the hands of ſuch as <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had deputed. The Garriſons alſo in <hi>Ponteſtura</hi> and <hi>Nizza</hi> were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, all with great applauſe to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> if further act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the period of the calamity of <hi>Italy</hi> might have ſtopped here. Concerning this reſtitution, there had been drawn an haſty Writing betwixt the Prince and the Marqueſs <hi>Crivelli,</hi> aſſiſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Annibal Chieppio</hi> for <hi>Mantua,</hi> in which mention was only made of the Conſignation, and not a word ſpoken of their reciprocal pretenſions, nor of the reparation of damages, which <hi>Mantua</hi> required, or an Act of pardon for thoſe of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> which <hi>Carlo</hi> deſired. Moreover, beſides having ſpoiled the Magazins of Arms, Cannon, and Victuals at his going out of <hi>Trin,</hi> the Count <hi>de Verua</hi> proteſted, that <hi>Carlo</hi> would ſharply revenge whatſoever mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation ſhould be offered to St. <hi>Giorge;</hi> becauſe he knew well, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had an implacable hatred to him; who afterwards proſcribing him with others, as Rebels, cauſed his houſe to be razed to the ground. Such roots not plucked up in time quickly begot jealouſies, and ſoon after hoſtility with new diſaſters: nor indeed were all men in <hi>Italy</hi> pleaſed with ſuch a Peace; becauſe it appeared, that the Governour haſtening the performance of the reſolutions to put himſelf out of ingagement, and to preſerve the appearance, had not ſincerely ſeparated himſelf from confidence with <hi>Carlo;</hi> but as if they two had colluded together for ſome ſecret and unknown de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, the Duke, at the time the places were rendred, re-inforced his Troops, and the Governour armed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſtanding expoſed betwixt the artifices of the one, and the power of the other, was in great fear; and thereupon the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> continued to him the payment of the 3000 Foot, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelves with 2000 others, they ſollicited paſſage and Levies in <hi>Switzerland; Gregory Barberigo,</hi> who was going Ambaſſador to the King of <hi>England,</hi> ſtaying ſome time at <hi>Zurich</hi> for that purpoſe. The firſt diſturbance to the quiet was the reparation of damages, and the oblivion to Rebels: For <hi>Ferdinand</hi> would not give way to the one, and choſe to keep the other on foot to oppoſe it to ſome of <hi>Carlo</hi>'s pretenſions. <hi>Carlo</hi> on the other ſide publiſhes in diſcourſe and in print, that the Governour had promiſed him to reſtore the baniſhed into the poſſeſſion of favour, and their Eſtates, aboliſhing all mention of damages, provided he conſented to have the Infant Princeſs brought to <hi>Milan.</hi> In effect, the Governour pours forth threatnings, and proteſts againſt <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> if he ſhould not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in his will, and that with ſuch vehemency, that thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all the Princes, being aware, that under the pretext of a long Peace ſervitude was ſlipt in, were offended at the terms of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and command, in which he declared himſelf. <hi>Monferrat</hi> was the chief ſufferer both from the frequent Incurſions of <hi>Carlo,</hi> and the Quarters, which the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> under the title of protection, kept there; whence it was univerſally believed, that the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> had brought things to that paſs, that without Peace, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out War he thought it the moſt probable way to get it for that Crown.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53750:20"/>
Other Princes made it their buſineſs to allay the diſguſts; and <hi>Caſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glione</hi> particularly in the name of the Emperour, admoniſhes the Marqueſs to uſe more complacency towards the Princes: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from threatnings turning himſelf to intreaties and friendly offices, the effect was, that <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> induced thereto by the Councils of the Republick, offers to refer all his rights to the Pope, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the King. But <hi>Inoioſa</hi> not approving to admit Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions to his King, neither in the preheminence, nor in the buſineſs, in place of an anſwer, which was expected, ſends to <hi>Mantua Anthony Piementelli,</hi> Governour of the light Horſe, to demand afreſh the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The Order came from <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Governour, who had ſuggeſted it, executed it with ſuch urgency, that it looked, as if he had a mind to take her away by force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Piementelli</hi> repreſents ſeriouſly to <hi>Ferdinand; That the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf took due care for the education of the Niece; That ſhe belonged to him, not only by blood, but by authority and intereſt; and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged by his alliance, and affection, ſhe might be brought up in</hi> Milan, <hi>as in her own houſe; That the King was ſo far from truſting her unto</hi> Savoy, <hi>that he had impoſed upon him the reſpect due to the intereſts of</hi> Mantua; <hi>The pledge of the quiet of</hi> Italy <hi>being placed in the Child, it was in every reſpect fit ſhe ſhould be depoſited into the hands of the King, who even to jealouſie profeſſed himſelf her ſecurity, and Guardian. Of what was</hi> Ferdinand <hi>afraid? if his Countries were ſo happily reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered under the Royal protection? Can he poſſibly diſtruſt, that ſhe, who is near to them both, may not be in ſafety, and with a decorum under it? Can he poſſibly fear, that by ſuch means the Child ſhould be raviſhed from him, by him who reſtores him to his State, repairs his damages, and protects the Family? That he was to remember, that the reſentments and power of great Princes are not to be ſweetned and appeaſed but by obedience.</hi> The Duke was vexed at ſuch diſcourſes, knowing <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentellis</hi> perſwaſions accompanied with authority and power, and his own replies aſſiſted only with reaſon, and intreaties: yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his negatives with alledging the reſpect, which he profeſſed to the Emperour, and Queen Regent of <hi>France,</hi> who had ſeriouſly preſſed upon him not to alienate the Niece; and to juſtifie himſelf, required time to ſend ſome Miniſter of his to <hi>Madrid.</hi> But <hi>Piemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telli</hi> being not at all ſatisfied therewith, refuſes to depart without the Princeſs, when ſhe falling ſick, and he being brought to ſee, that ſhe was not in a condition to be hazarded in a journey, it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a juſt excuſe for his departure.</p>
            <p>The Duke with all ſpeed ſends into <hi>Spain Scipione Paſquali Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerendarie,</hi> and another Miniſter into <hi>France</hi> to repreſent his excuſes to the one, and ſollicite the aſſiſtance and good offices of the other Court. The Governor, at the ſame time he ſent <hi>Piementelli</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> not to ſhew partiality, had diſpatched <hi>Sanchio Luna, Caſtellan</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> to <hi>Turin,</hi> to ſignifie to the Duke he muſt diſarm. <hi>Carlo</hi> foreſeeing, that his diſagreeing with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> tended to make them both fall under the Dominion of <hi>Spain,</hi> not being willing flatly to deny it, carries himſelf with ſeveral pretexts, and in particular, that hearing

there was a <hi>Rendez-vous</hi> of ſome <hi>French</hi> upon his Borders,<label type="milestone">

The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters obſerved well, that his aims were either to draw in, and at the ſame time ſet on the <hi>French,</hi> or betwixt ill Quarters and bad accommodation to conſume the flower of the Forces of <hi>Milan.</hi> Rejecting therefore the Propoſition, they preſſed him to diſarm, and the Secretary <hi>Vargas</hi> going into <hi>Spain</hi> paſſed by <hi>Turin,</hi> to know <hi>Carlo</hi> his poſitive intentions. He in the preſence of <hi>Vargas</hi> cauſed a ſhew to be made of diſbanding ſome Troops, but it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a reforming, becauſe ſending home the Militia of the Country, which might eaſily come together again, he kept on foot the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. Neither did the Governour proceed in forms diſproportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; whereupon not being able to penetrate into the preſent Councils, nor make a judgment of future accidents, the minds of the Princes remained perplexed amidſt the ſeveral Intereſts, and in no leſs ſuſpicions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> making theſe Intereſts their buſineſs, remonſtrated to the Catholick King the glory of moderation, and the ſecuring of the Peace.

They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from the Pope the care of his Paſtoral Office; and of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> the Authority of the Imperial name, to confirm quiet. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in place of facilitating peace, and doing offices to the Princes for it, impoſed ſuch conditions, as appeared to all no leſs diſpleaſing than a War, becauſe they at <hi>Madrid</hi> finally expreſſed the Kings intentions to be; <hi>That the points of the Rebels, and dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſhould be referred to the Pope, the Emperour, and himſelf: That the Princeſs ſhould be brought to</hi> Milan; <hi>the Mother marry with</hi> Ferdinand, <hi>and both the Dukes diſarm; the Forces of the King being ſufficient to execute whatever ſhould be needful for relieving the oppreſſed, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the refractory.</hi>

               <hi>Carlo</hi> ſtormed, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> reſents highly, that at one and the ſame time his Niece ſhould be violently taken out of his houſe from him, and his own will forced to the Marriage. Nevertheleſs not ſeeming to diſſent, he interpoſes for excuſe, that it was fit, that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Marriage, all diffidences ſhould be reconciled, and the Rights of the States adjuſted. In this uncertain ſtate of affairs ends the year 1613; in which, for what concerns the <hi>Venetians</hi> at Sea (beſides what we have related of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi>) four Gallies of <hi>Barbary</hi> meeting at <hi>Saſeno</hi> to rob, were by <hi>Girolamo Cornaro,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor of the Fleet, chaſtiſed with the taking of one, and putting the reſt to flight: two Chriſtian Ships with many Slaves being by this means reſcued out of the Pirates hands. This ſerved rather for an example than was of much conſequence. There appeared a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53750:21"/>
greater danger ariſing from the attempt of <hi>Octavio d' Arragona,</hi> who with eight Gallies of <hi>Sicily,</hi> paſſing beyond the Iſland of <hi>Scio,</hi> had ſurpriſed twelve <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies, and taken ſeven with a very rich booty, and a great number of Slaves. The <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port, taking the outrage to be as great as the loſs, publiſhed their threatnings to revenge themſelves without diſtinction upon all Chriſtians, and in the Spring to put a powerful Fleet to Sea.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> as neareſt and moſt expoſed, made ready ſome armed Ships, and ordered the number of Gallies in <hi>Candia</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> upon this rumour of preparations, and threatnings, though in ſuch Intereſts he may with reaſon be ſaid to be ſeparate from the World, offers the Republick, in magnificent terms, his Forces, when they ſhould be invaded by the <hi>Turks.</hi> The Republick publiſhing the offer, that it might ſerve for a terrour to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and an example to the Chriſtians, anſwered both with thanks and applauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carlo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Nivers,</hi> about this time had conceived grievous thoughts againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and much greater than thoſe, which the condition of a private Prince could bear, and under the name of a Chriſtian Militia had ingaged in ſeveral Provinces where he had been for that purpoſe, ſeveral men to follow him. In the parts of <hi>France</hi> he had ſome few Veſſels ready, and carried on an Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in <hi>Morea.</hi> Being now at liberty from that buſineſs, which had ſo long kept him in <hi>Monferrat,</hi> he went to <hi>Rome</hi> to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his deſigns to the Pope, demand a Squadron of his Gallies, and the authority of his endeavours to move the Princes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſet upon that vaſt Empire, not with Leagues, which were long and doubtful in treating, but every one with the Arms, which lay proper for him. The Pope encourages the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as the moſt powerful at Sea, in great earneſt; but they meaſuring the buſineſs according to piety and prudence, offered conſiderations to the Pope, of how much miſchief might happen from provoking ſo powerful an Enemy, without hope of bringing him under: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs offered, having above all others juſt provocations of intereſt and revenge, to concur with all their power, when the other Princes of Chriſtendom ſhould reſolve upon it indeed, and lay aſide thoſe jealouſies, which unſeaſonably diſtracted <hi>Italy</hi> at preſent. The Popes zeal being applauded in other Courts, all offering, and no body performing, the project fell quickly into ſilence.</p>

               <p>With the new year the affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> were much changed; for the two Crowns, having repoſed in the Marriages concluded the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of their union and power for the oppreſſion of others, under the pretext of removing the War out of that Country, introduced ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude there. The Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> made their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints upon like terms; the one, that his Army and his Daughter were violently taken from him; and the other, that his will, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53750:21"/>
his Niece were diſpoſed of without his conſent. <hi>Carlo</hi> aggravated with greater vehemence, telling the publick Miniſters of Princes, which reſided with him; <hi>What ſignifies the requiring of my laying down Arms elſe, but to exact from</hi> Italy <hi>a Tribute of the baſeſt ſlavery? I reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatneſs and the authority of the King, my Kinſman, have yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up at his beck my Conqueſts, and my hopes, and now am paid with ingratitude, and ſcorn. My rights are buried, Marriages are impoſed upon me, I am commanded to diſarm. Can ſlavery have any thing in it more baſe, and miſerable? Shall I then give up for Hoſtages the Guard of my ſecurity, and ſhall my Countries Subjects, my Family, and my own Perſon remain diſarmed, and expoſed to the ambition of another? What teſtimonies of moſt partial affections have not I gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to</hi> Spain? <hi>One of my Sons, though in great Command, is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, if I may ſay ſo, a Priſoner, and a Slave amidſt the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Guards. The other, who is the Heir to my Eſtates, I have delivered into the Kings hand for a pledge of Fidelity. All this is not ſufficient, but now it is impoſed upon me to diſarm. Who ſhall ſecure my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes from a potent Neighbour? Can the</hi> Spaniards <hi>poſſibly think to ſatisfie the jealouſies of my mind, by the ſame way they make it lawful to diſpoſe of my Daughter? The Governour of</hi> Milan <hi>diſarms not, though protected by the name, and defended with the ſhadow of ſo great a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; and ſhall</hi> Piedmont <hi>be left deſtitute of all help? It belongs to the weaker, to beware of the more powerful; and in the defence of a mans ſelf, and the protections of Subjects, the Laws, and obligation of Principality make all equal, why ſhould Fortune alone predominate? If</hi> Spain <hi>can gain this point with me, we Princes of</hi> Italy <hi>ſhall from hence forward lye at his feet, either fearing puniſhment, or asking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, without other glory, than to be at the pleaſure of his Miniſters, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubdued by Arms, or deluded in Treaties. An unwary Peace hath brought us to this paſs, and a more baſe obedience will degrade us from all Authority and Command.</hi> Such were the complaints of <hi>Carlo,</hi> who, though the Governour threatned, <hi>France</hi> ſuſpected, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try lay open, and his two Sons were in the power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> couragiouſly profeſſed to dye armed, no leſs than to live like a Prince. Many had a fellow-feeling with him, inſinuated alſo by their own fear and intereſt in the firſt offence, taken at him for his unſeaſonable taking up of Arms.</p>
               <p>The Queen Regent of <hi>France,</hi> to make appear a ſhadow of her Authority, diſpatches at laſt the Marqueſs <hi>de Couvre</hi> Ambaſſador to the Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> but <hi>Carlo,</hi> knowing that he brought nothing but offices, and preſſing inſtances, that the Marriage might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and Arms laid down, when the Marqueſs was arrived in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> went to <hi>Nizza,</hi> taking his pretext from ſome commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by reaſon of grievances, which were riſen amongſt thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; whereupon the other ſtaying ſome days, and having diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what the matter was, ſeeing himſelf laught at before he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, paſſed haſtily to <hi>Milan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, notwithſtanding the apparent Confidences betwixt theſe Crowns, could not endure to have in <hi>Italy</hi> a <hi>French</hi>-man
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:53750:22"/>
for Companion or Oppoſite, labouring by all poſſible means, that not only the authority, but the name of that Monarchy ſhould not be revived again in that Country; inſomuch that the Governour declares to him, in excuſe that he did not admit him, and withal not to diſguſt him, that, the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> having, by ſending a Miniſter into <hi>Spain,</hi> transferred to <hi>Madrid</hi> the ſeat of the Treaty for thoſe affairs, they were to be managed there, and not elſewhere. The Ambaſſadour then going to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to ſhew himſelf not wholly uſeleſs, beſides general offices, and conſolations, exhorts him, bating the delivery of the Niece, to conſent to the Marriage, and the reſt of the points. With this alſo the Councils of <hi>Caſtiglione,</hi> and the Reſident of the <hi>Venetians</hi> agreed; becauſe it being diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>Italy</hi> could promiſe little of it ſelf, and that Strangers did conſpire to her prejudice and deſtruction, it ſeemed beſt, that the impending ſtorm ſhould in ſome meaſure be diverted; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſollicited the Duke for his conſent, to the end that for matters of no great concernment, the fault of having diſturbed <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> might not be laid on his ſhoulders; always excepting the Niece, who was thought a price worthy of the danger of a breach, and War. That which was the deſire and prayer of all, came doubly confirmed from <hi>Spain,</hi> as a preciſe command, and particularly that the Marriage ſhould be conſummated, with the agreements made with the Duke <hi>Francis</hi> excepting the line, and ceſſion of Rights; for their minds being by this new band united, the King would have ſeaſonably provided for that, which his authority and the general quiet required. <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> out of a firm belief that <hi>Carlo</hi> would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, feigns to ſhew compliance with <hi>Spain,</hi> to yield to their will; only ſollicited, that the marriage might be accompliſhed, under the the word of the King, Emperour, and <hi>France,</hi> that he ſhould no more be diſturbed by the <hi>Savoyards</hi> with Armies, and that the Niece might not be taken out of the Family; and for the reſt, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the marriage he aſſented to the pardon of the Rebels, and not to keep on foot the pretenſion of damages, but to make uſe of them againſt ſome pretenſions of the <hi>Savoyards;</hi> all which he declared to repre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for the publick good, and not to reſtrain the Kings will: But the Prince <hi>Vittorio</hi> returned from <hi>Spain,</hi> who, after the news of the reſtitution of the places poſſeſſed in <hi>Monferrat,</hi> being admitted to the Court, was from the pride of the Grandees, and the jealouſie and averſion of the Favourite, though the Kings Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, received with coldneſs and ſcorn, related to his Father the abſolute will of their Councils; <hi>That he was to obey or ſubmit, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they threatned to puniſh and chaſtiſe him, in deſign to bring down that natural height of his ſpirit, which made him ſuſpicious to the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. <hi>That the Duke of</hi> Lerma <hi>ſpake of his intereſts with hatred and diſdain, vaunting that if heretofore he had diverted a Marriage betwixt the King and one</hi> Carlo<hi>'s Daughter, he did now alſo know how to afflict and mortifie him.</hi> Such thoughts as theſe ſerved the Duke fitly as ſo many provocations to ſhake off the yoke; and therefore inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the pretenſions of the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> he refuſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53750:22"/>
to the marriage of <hi>Margaret</hi> with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> if the things in diſpute were not firſt agreed, and that his pretenſions might find ſuch advantage, as he fancied to himſelf was due: But foreſeeing, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would quickly follow their commands with force, he arms the beſt he could; invites ſome <hi>French</hi> of quality to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, raiſes men in the Vallies, and in <hi>Bern,</hi> imploreth the favour of all far and near, and in particular where he knew, that for inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or emulation the power of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was ſuſpected, he uſed all his Art to inſinuate himſelf. With a conſiderable penſion he obliges the Count <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> to ſerve him, and begets a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular confidence with <hi>Maurice</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> that ſaw himſelf againſt his will inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a War of Reputation and Puntillio, neglects not any means to increaſe his Forces. <hi>Italy</hi> thus filled with Armies, the Princes grew more and more jealous, and diſordered. <hi>Monſerrat</hi> almoſt no leſs poſſeſſed, than oppreſſed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Quarters there, gave <hi>Inoioſa</hi> occaſion to inſinuate under-hand to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that that Country languiſhing betwixt Jealouſies and Armies, it would be more advantagious for him to exchange it for another leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious and expoſed. But the Duke alledged for excuſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſure of the preſent affairs, and the conſideration he had of <hi>Italy,</hi> which being accuſtomed in the greateſt calm to fluctuate amidſt jealouſies, would in this Conjuncture be toſſed up and down with more violent diſcontents. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> to ſay truth, had alone the power in their hands: For the Queen Regent had recalled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon as he appeared, the Marqueſs <hi>de Couvre</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> contenting her ſelf for that time to have laid a ſtone of Foundation for her Authority, to build upon when a better Conjuncture ſhould make way for it; there diſcovering it ſelf juſt at that inſtant in that Kingdom one of the wonted ſtorms of that Climate. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the great Ones having united themſelves under the Conduct and Command of <hi>Conde,</hi> firſt Prince of the Blood Royal, pretended with a plauſible pretext to hinder the Marriages with <hi>Spain,</hi> as if the Maxims and Intereſts of that Crown would thereby be introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the Government of <hi>France.</hi> The more ſecret motive ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs aroſe from the Intereſt of ſome, who propoſed to make their profit in that <hi>Criſis,</hi> which the King, being near going out of his Minority, gave hopes to afford private advantages, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and envy of all concurred againſt <hi>Concino Concini,</hi> called the Mareſhal <hi>d' Ancre,</hi> who, brought by the Regent out of <hi>Italy,</hi> was from mean Parentage, by her great favour advanced to the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place of Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo,</hi> who from <hi>France</hi> expected jealouſies rather than ſuccours, was not ill pleaſed to ſee that diſturbance, and the mind of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent diſtracted. He entertains therefore a Confidence with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, and they, ſending the Seignor <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rfu</hi> to <hi>Turin,</hi> inſinuate with ſeveral Propoſitions, that ſetting aſide the Arbitrage of the Crowns, the differences betwixt the two Houſes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> might be referred to the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> their common Parent.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53750:23"/>
But that buſineſs, however neglected by <hi>France,</hi> was not ſo eaſily to be taken out of the hands of <hi>Spain,</hi> which held it faſt by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bonds of Authority and Power. The ſtirs now in <hi>France</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſhed, and a Conference held at <hi>Soiſſons</hi> quiets all, with the promiſe in appearance of the Regent, to defer the conſummation of the Marriages till the States of the Kingdom were called. And for this the united Princes conceived great merit to themſelves, participating, by the means of the ſaid Seignor <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rfu,</hi> the agreement to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and inviting them to cooperate, that the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, which would be troubleſom to the Nation, and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all, might be wholly diſappointed. The more ſecret condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions notwithſtanding conſiſted in private advantages; for to <hi>Conde</hi> was given the Caſtle of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> to <hi>Nevers</hi> St. <hi>Menehoud,</hi> and to all in general great recompences; fruits accuſtomed in <hi>France</hi> to be reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that, which elſewhere was puniſhed by the Hangman. In <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> the ſuſpicion of the Mediation of <hi>France</hi> diſappearing, and the Treaty re-aſſumed, the <hi>Savoyards</hi> and <hi>Mantuans</hi> joyned iſſue for a meeting in the preſence of the Governour to mediate the Peace of <hi>Italy. Caſtiglione</hi> wearied himſelf with many Expedients, and becauſe <hi>Carlo</hi> as the recompence of his rights propoſed, that ſome part of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> and namely the <hi>Canaveſe</hi> might be yielded to him, he inſinuates the Marriage of <hi>Margaret</hi> with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and of his Siſter <hi>Eleonora</hi> with the Prince <hi>Vittorio,</hi> giving to the <hi>Savoyards</hi> certain Lands near unto <hi>Turin,</hi> of about the value of 5000 Crowns yearly Revenue. But all was turned topſie-turvy by the Governours inſiſting, that <hi>Carlo</hi> ſhould diſarm, intimating that without more ado he ſhould perform it within ſix days. On the other ſide <hi>Carlo</hi> undauntedly denies it, and knowing himſelf in the neceſſity to provide himſelf of Friends, fixed his eye upon the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whoſe Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence always heretofore having been improved by him with all ſorts of offices, had had effects conſiderable, and honourable for <hi>Italy;</hi> but at preſent had been interrupted by his tranſport of anger for the aſſiſtances of the Republick to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> for which the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour <hi>Guſſoni</hi> was diſcharged; and although by means of <hi>Hippolito</hi> Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandin,</hi> he had endeavoured to renew it again, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs in the Senate, which always maintains the point of its dignity, he had found a deaf ear to whatever he had propoſed.</p>
               <p>But now pricked forward by the urgency of more reſolute refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he ſends to <hi>Venice Giovani Jacomo Piſcina,</hi> a Senator of much wit, and voluble eloquence, who was received by <hi>Dudly Carleton</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>England.</hi> That King ſhewed himſelf beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure partial for the Duke, by improving with ſuch a friendſhip that reſt of authority, which he had a mind to aſſume in the Affairs of <hi>Italy;</hi> and therefore the Ambaſſadour laboured exceedingly, that he might be introduced, remonſtrating to the Senate, that to the teſtimonies of ancient reſpect, the Duke added at preſent one more apparent, than poſſibly could be deſired, by ſending an Ambaſſador expreſs, who ſhould ſoon be followed with a Leiger, to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the arms of the Republick, and to open his heart to them,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53750:23"/>
hear their judgment, and imbrace their counſels. He interpoſed the intreaties of the King, and paſſing to more ſerious appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the preſent Conjuncture, he conſidered that the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Princes, except in things belonging to Religion and Juſtice, did adjuſt themſelves according to Intereſt and Time: the Punctilioes and Formalities rather befitting private men, ought not to divert Princes from the ſubſtance of more weighty affairs. He moved them to reflect, that if the <hi>Italians</hi> diſunite, all would ſink under the burden; but joyned together, would with impunity deſpiſe Foreign powers. He preſſed upon the Conjuncture and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the times; whereupon at laſt, after ſome difficulty, <hi>Piſcina</hi> was admitted into the Colledge, to open to them all that had paſſed betwixt the Duke and the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> He inſiſted much upon the violences, which they preſumed to offer him; deplored the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes; added the conſequences of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample no leſs than the motives of the common Intereſt; deſpaired, through the pride of the Governour of <hi>Milan, Caſtiglione</hi> being weary of propoſing Expedients, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> having called back his Deputies to <hi>Mantua,</hi> of a good end of any Treaty. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtirs up the Senate to reflections and remedies, how to uphold the Dignity of <hi>Italy,</hi> which if it reverenced that Aſſembly as the Tutelar Deity of its Liberty, <hi>Carlo,</hi> as eldeſt Son of the Republick, deſired to have it for his Director and Father.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> conſoled the Duke, and aſſured him of their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and good offices, and exhorting him to an agreement with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and to Peace, that neither of them ſhould omit any thing to render that reſpect to <hi>Spain,</hi> which in the diſproportion of their Forces might be compatible with the Dignity of a Free Prince: They at the ſame time earneſtly purſue in all the Courts their ſenſe and deſire of Peace, moving ſome to be Mediators, intreating others to facilitate the rejoyning of the Treaties; in <hi>Spain</hi> particularly, and in <hi>Milan</hi> not miſſing to repreſent the dangers of the War, and the calamities. But <hi>Inoioſa</hi> ſhews himſelf rather provoked than ſatisfied with <hi>Piſcina</hi>'s journey to <hi>Venice;</hi> whereupon the Republick grounding their own jealouſies upon thoſe of his, the aſpect of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs continued to look more and more troubled: And ſhe in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to arm her ſelf, ſubſtituting <hi>Antonio Lando,</hi> Procurator <hi>di St. Marco,</hi> into the Generalat to <hi>Priuli,</hi> committed the Levy of 2000 Foot to the Prince <hi>Lewis d'Eſte,</hi> newly entred into their Service. Of the <hi>Switzers</hi> ſhe procured, as hath been ſaid, paſſage and Levies; but neither being to be obtained without a League, the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour <hi>Barbarigo</hi> applies himſelf to the management of it, remaining ſome time for that purpoſe among the <hi>Griſons,</hi> a people no leſs groſs by nature, as they are rough by ſituation; but with them he found no diſpoſition to renew that, which being formerly ſtipulated with the Republick was lately expired; becauſe, beſides the venality of their friendſhip and intereſts, oppoſition was made by <hi>Paſcal,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter, who by rendring the paſſage of <hi>Rhaetia</hi> common to others, thought it would be a derogation to the pretended Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53750:24"/>
of that Crown. Whereupon he goes back to <hi>Zurich,</hi> where, and at <hi>Bern,</hi> being the ſeats of the beſt Government, and greateſt Power of <hi>Helvetia,</hi> it was no hard matter to adjuſt an Alliance. And in the Diet, called at <hi>Baden</hi> for that purpoſe, the project of the two Cantons was approved, notwithſtanding the violent oppoſition made by the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who could not ſuffer, that a way ſhould be opened for the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to arm themſelves; which if it ſerved not wholly to diſcompoſe, might yet for the preſent prolong the Treaty.</p>

Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs frequent diſturbances and aſſaults were heard of 400 of them, who roading along the ſhore, and chaſing away the Guards came to St. <hi>Michael,</hi> a Rock oppoſite to <hi>Zara,</hi> where landing, and ſome being left as a guard to favour the retreat, the others paſſed through the Territory of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to plunder <hi>Iſlan,</hi> a Town of the <hi>Turks,</hi> returning with many Slaves and a rich booty, without withdrawing the Guard from the Rock, till they ſaw the <hi>Venetians</hi> in motion to drive them away by force. <hi>Felice Dobrovich,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Albaneſe,</hi> took one of their Barges, which was condemned to be burnt, and the men to be hanged. After this, <hi>Paſqualigo</hi> came to be General of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo Veniero</hi> of <hi>Albania,</hi> and ſtill more and more ſtraitned <hi>Segna,</hi> doubling the Guards, and having an eye every where; ſo that the <hi>

               <p>But <hi>Inoioſa</hi> refuſes every thing that might have but the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Capitulation, much leſs the ſhew of parity; and although by his own inclination he was far from breaking, yet he could not avoid, by ſtrict reiterated Commiſſions from <hi>Spain,</hi> coming to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, letting the Duke know ſo much by <hi>Luigi Gaetano</hi> Ambaſſador of that Crown in <hi>Turin;</hi> and himſelf at the ſame time marches with his Army to the Borders of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> But the Duke not at all frighted, nor rendring himſelf at his threatnings, bidding <hi>Gaetano</hi> be gone, delivers to him to be carried to the King the Order of the

The Governour without diſpute was ſuperior in number, and there being arrived in thoſe parts ſome thouſands of men from <hi>Spain,</hi> it was obſerved, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed and diſbarked at <hi>Genoua</hi> by the Prince <hi>Filibert,</hi> a Son of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo's,</hi> General at Sea, in oſtentation, as it were, that the Son ſhould be made the Miniſter of the Fathers chaſtiſements.

The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Chavalry, to be even, marching along the <hi>Seſia,</hi> met with a notable Encounter, where they would have come off with the worſt, if the Prince of <hi>Aſcoli,</hi> with a great body of Foot, had not ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably come in to their ſuccour, ſo that the <hi>Savoyards</hi> received a blow, and the Marqueſs <hi>di Caluſo,</hi> Governour of <hi>Vercelli,</hi> taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> of the Kings Army burnt <hi>Careſana</hi> and <hi>la Mota,</hi> and the <hi>Savoyards</hi> in revenge fired ſome Towns of the <hi>Milaneſe;</hi> the burning of the Bridge, built by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> at <hi>Villatta</hi> over the <hi>Seſia,</hi> not ſucceeding, which the Duke at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, ſo to have cut off their Camp from the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi>

               <p>Such reſiſtance, among the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had the qualification of a hainous offence; and <hi>Inoioſa</hi> ſhewed himſelf ſo diſordered at it, that to <hi>Auguſtino Dolce</hi> the Reſident at <hi>Venice,</hi> who perſwaded to more peaceable remedies, he ſharply anſwered; <hi>That if the Grandeur of the King abhorred to take away what was anothers, it equally belonged to his power to mortifie the contumacy of the Duke, whoſe offences were gone ſo far, that they left him nothing in his power but puniſhment and correction.

But in direct oppoſition to the ordinary government of the World, it might be ſaid, that the ſevere influence of the higher Region, which in <hi>Spain</hi> was that ill will, the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> bore to <hi>Carlo,</hi> was mitigated and corrected by that of the lower and nearer, which in <hi>Milan</hi> was the Marqueſs Governour; becauſe find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> was invaded, and on all ſides open and undefend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he immediately abandoning the Poſts of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> retires with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his own Confines, to the ſo much heightning of the Duke, that he eſteemed and publiſhed him conquered.</p>
               <p>The Governour incamps not far from <hi>Vercelli,</hi> to ſecure the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a great Fortreſs, which, being a mile in circuit, he placed within the Kings Confines in a ſituation very commodious; for it did not only ſerve to bridle <hi>Vercelli,</hi> but to cover the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> and ſhut up a paſſage open enough to ſtrangers for the Invaſion of that State: An old deſign of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters; but, not to raiſe jealouſies in time of quiet amongſt the Princes with novelty, defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be put in effect till this preſent Conjuncture. It was named <hi>Sandoval,</hi> in honour of the Duke of <hi>Lerma:</hi> and <hi>Inoioſa</hi> amuſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there without further action for ſeveral weeks, with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach from thoſe who would have wiſhed rather, that he had marched into the bowels of <hi>Piedmont</hi> to chaſtiſe the Duke, and lay waſte the Country. The ſeaſon, to ſay truth, for the imployment of Armies paſſed in this <hi>interim,</hi> and gave time, that in the name of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who, though come out of his Minority, left the burden of the Government to his Mother, arrives as Ambaſſadour in <hi>Italy Carlo</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Rambogliet,</hi> to perſwade and preſs the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to diſarm. It ſufficiently appeared, that the Councils of that Crown tended to make a Peace at the charge of the Dukes Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Eſtate, and it was made the more evident, that while <hi>Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogliet</hi> paſſed the <hi>Alps,</hi> Monſieur <hi>de Sillery</hi> was on his way from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>

into <hi>Spain</hi> to concert the exchange of the two Spouſes on the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>Carlo</hi> utters his mind with bitter complaints, that both the Crowns conſpired againſt his dignity and ſecurity. But <hi>Rambogliet,</hi> paſſing by the conſideration of what was fit, judged warranty enough the word which <hi>France</hi> offered with an order to <hi>Dighieres</hi> to march immediately to his aſſiſtance, if any moleſtation ſhould come upon him from <hi>Milan;</hi> otherwiſe if he ſhould continue refuſing to lay down Arms, threatens him to give a ſummons to all the <hi>French,</hi> of which the greateſt ſtrength of his Army conſiſted, to abandon his Standard and Service.</p>
               <p>The Duke conſidering, that ſuccours, after a loſs received, would come too late, and be unprofitable, judged, that the ſafeſt guard for a Prince conſiſted in his own ſtrength; another mans word, faith, and orders would not want evaſions and pretexts. He ſays; <hi>I am divided from</hi> France <hi>by Mountains, Precipices, and Rocks, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the</hi> Milaneſe <hi>with narrow Ditches only. How often may the ſeaſons and the ſnow conteſt for me the paſſages from</hi> France? <hi>The King hath the name, the Queen the power. The Marriages are deſired, the bonds to joyn intereſt with</hi> Spain <hi>are haſtning. If that Crown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon me falling, I ſhall be laughed at when I am down. If I lay down Arms in the fear of my armed Enemy, who ſhall ſecure me from blows? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the diſpatch of a Courrier, Armies are not ſo quickly ready for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Whither ſhall I direct my complaints, and who ſhall be the judge of my wrongs and my offences? Reaſon without force is little differing from a trick of wit; and on the other ſide force without reaſon paſſes for the height of juſtice.</hi> With ſuch reaſonings the Duke counſelled himſelf not to yield, and <hi>Julio Savelli,</hi> the Popes Nuntio, having propoſed, that the Army might be conſigned to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, to the end the diſbanding might be treated by a Peer with equal dignity, he refuſes it: not to ſubject himſelf to the judgment of both, while he contended with the predominancy but of one of the Crowns.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſeeing it difficult to bend the Duke to the reſpect pretended by them, ſollicited <hi>Inoioſa,</hi> that ſince he had threatned with ſo much earneſt, that he would not imploy force ſo faintly, it ſeeming to them, that the Arms of that Monarchy were fallen below that opinion of <hi>Invincible,</hi> into which they had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to inveſt her. But the edge of the affairs at Land by the Governours ſlackneſs ſeeming to be blunted, they deliberate to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a maritime power to torment <hi>Piedmont</hi> on all ſides. The Fleet, making a courſe into <hi>Sicily</hi> to defend it from the attempts, which the <hi>Turks</hi> threatned in requital of what had paſſed the year before, ſailed within ſight of <hi>Navarino,</hi> where the <hi>Turks</hi> lay; but without hazarding a Fight: they loſing two of their Gallies, which were ſent out to diſcover, both retired. Part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> with <hi>Philibert</hi> ſailed into <hi>Spain;</hi> but the Squadron of <hi>Italy</hi> with the Merchant Ships of <hi>Genoa,</hi> which were in the Kings Service, making a good body, attempt the enterpriſe upon <hi>Oneglia.</hi> The Dukes Territories face two ways towards the Mediterrarean; the <hi>one,</hi> where towards the

In further reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he had in his mind greater deſigns by the ſurpriſal of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel of the Capital City it ſelf, which was to be executed by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships; but being diſcovered, gave only to underſtand, that amidſt the ſtraights of a moſt dangerous War, his mind was ſtill carried forth to great Conqueſts. To manifeſt the friendſhip, renewed with the Republick, he had received in <hi>Aſti</hi> the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour <hi>Zeno</hi> with all poſſible honour, and having heard the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Councils of the Senate tending to Peace, one day, all fire and courage, he ſpake to this purpoſe; <hi>I deny not but the deliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Soveraignty, the good of</hi> Italy, <hi>and the felicity of the World are placed in Peace. But what is that Peace which an Enemy offers, who hath War in his heart, and in his hands? Let us, I pray, draw it out in its proper ſhape, and well conſider if we can tell how to diſtinguiſh it from baſeneſs, ſervitude, and infamy. I do not ſee but an imperfect mixture, which is compounded of theſe two Elements only, Empire and Obedience. The one I hold from Heaven common with the King. The other is not known in my Family. Liberty is a Twin of Dignity; they have Chance, Fate, Accidents common; the one is not offended, but the other reſents it. Oh let us once reſolve to attempt great things, and not diſtruſt Fortune! We ſhall find that power, which in perſpective appears terrible, to grow leſs from it ſelf, and vaniſh like a ſhadow, if we ſhall have hearts to go near it.

What cauſe more juſt to ſhake off the yoke, which is made more inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by our own patience? where can the Republick better imploy their Power, their greatneſs of Mind, and their Treaſures than to the relief of an oppreſſed Prince, and oppreſſed for no other occaſion, but becauſe he would live and dye like a Prince. The Republick hath large Confines with</hi> Spain, <hi>but by this League may enlarge them, even to</hi> Piedmont. <hi>This State ſhall be all at her devotion, and ſhe ſhall be able to ſay, that ſhe environs the</hi> Milaneſe <hi>more than ſhe is encompaſſed by it.

If ſhe attacque, we will draw the groſs of the Enemies force on this ſide; if invaded, we will divert the miſchief with the hazard of our lives and blood. God hath given to the Republick and to me two flouriſhing States, which are balances to</hi> Italy, <hi>ſcourges and tongs to the</hi> Milaneſe. <hi>We have need to bind and unite our ſelves without delay; for if the</hi> Spaniards <hi>ſhould come to diſadvantage one part, the other will be made of no uſe. We are both armed, and to what purpoſe conſume our ſelves betwixt jealouſies and expences, without other advantage, but not to be overcome? The Republick abounds in Arms and Money, and to me men are not wanting. What a number of people ſhould we have begging paſſage, if we had once declared War, and I have the Keys of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains? We will cauſe floods of ſtranger Nations to come down into</hi> Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>whither the</hi> Spaniards <hi>can have no paſſage but with ſlow voyages by Sea, and moſt tedious marches by Land.

And when War is once declared, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but that the</hi> French, <hi>at leaſt privately, will run to our Colours. To a duplicated vigorous Invaſion how will the</hi> Milaneſe <hi>be able to reſiſt, lull'd aſleep in a long Peace, and under the ſhadow of an imaginary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, with weak places, an unwarlike people, and ſo remote from ſuccours? I invite the Republick to the ſpoils, not to dangers. I will be the firſt that ſhall invade, I will take ſome place or other, and then if the Republick will go before, and give the Princes of</hi> Italy <hi>an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we ſhall not be alone. Thoſe that cover themſelves moſt under the wings of that Monarchy, will be the firſt to pluck the feathers out of them. The</hi> Indies, Spain, <hi>and</hi> Flanders <hi>are not places we ought to be afraid of, but the States of</hi> Italy <hi>are the fetters of our ſlavery. Let us free our ſelves from them at laſt: for in the</hi> Milaneſe, <hi>as in the Center, the Regiſter of all the Monarchy being kept; diſorder that, the reſt will lye diſmembred and remote; nor ſhall we any more fear to have the</hi> Spaniards <hi>our enemies, when we ſhall not have them ſo near Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>

In the Spring the Armies were re-inforced, and great proviſions made, but the Duke with a new blow of a Treaty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſollicited by the Mediators, ſigns a paper for Peace, in which he conſents to diſarm, retaining only wonted and neceſſary Garriſons. It was promiſed him, that within fifteen or twenty days after the Governour ſhould alſo diſband his Army, and give his word to the Pope and King of <hi>France</hi> not to offend him, and in caſe of default, the Princes, called the Defenders of the Faith of <hi>Inoioſa,</hi> and Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators of the Duke, ſhould do it with Arms. The Priſoners, and places taken, were to be reciprocally rendred, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was to reſtore to <hi>Carlo</hi> the Dowry and Jewels of <hi>Margaret;</hi> other things in controverſie betwixt theſe two houſes were to be decided within ſix months after, or to be determined by Law, if any difficulty aroſe. The Dowry of <hi>Blanche</hi> was to be reſtored within two years, and the Rebels to be pardoned.</p>
               <p>It was much doubted, whether to this project, which ſecured few things, and left many undecided; <hi>Carlo,</hi> for the deſire of quiet, and apprehenſion of the Enemies Forces, or to gain applauſe, and to intereſt the Mediators in his cauſe, would give his conſent. But if that were his intention, the deſign deceived him not; for the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being carried by the <hi>Nuntio</hi> and <hi>Rambogliet</hi> to <hi>Inoioſa,</hi> with an aſſured hope, that he would approve it, becauſe the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> had alſo notified the Propoſition to the Court, they found, that by a late Commiſſion from <hi>Madrid,</hi> all power concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace was taken from him. It is not to be believed, how much they were offended at it; but not being able to obtain more, they demanded at leaſt a ſuſpenſion of Arms for forty days. The

might be reformed to the uſe of modern defence, they ſent three Senators, <hi>Giovanni Garzoni, Nicholo Contarini, Benedetto Tagliapie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> who joyning with <hi>Lando,</hi> General, and <hi>Girolamo Cornaro,</hi> chief Commiſſary, upon hearing the opinions of the Chief of the Army, ſhould reſolve upon that which was judged fit. Hereupon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to levy 3000 Foot more, deſiring they might be ſtrangers, in regard <hi>Italy,</hi> degenerating by idleneſs, hath with liberty loſt military vertue. Order was given to the Ambaſſadour <hi>Barbarigo</hi> to conclude a League with the two Cantons, <hi>Zurich</hi> and <hi>Bern,</hi> which conſiſted in promiſes from the Republick, to aſſiſt them with a ſum of money, if they ſhould be invaded; and for the Cantons, to permit the Levy of 4000 Foot of their Nation, whenever they ſhould have occaſion: in conſideration whereof, it was agreed, that the two Cities ſhould each receive a yearly penſion of 5000 Ducats, conformable to the cuſtom of the greater Potentates, from whom the <hi>Helvetians</hi> extract gold with their Valour and their Swords. The League notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was not yet publiſhed, becauſe, to aſſure the paſſages in the <hi>Griſons</hi> Country, it was agreed, that <hi>Barbarigo</hi> ſhould go thither with the Ambaſſadours of the two aſſociated Cities. That people, who of their government make a myſtery alſo of trade and gain, unmindful of the benefits received from the Common-wealth, of their own liberty, and of their obligation to open the paſſage to the Cantons, ſuffered themſelves to be ſeduced by the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> to deny it.</p>
               <p>Both the Crowns agreed therein, to the admiration of many; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if it ſerved the <hi>Spaniards</hi> turn for the ſubjecting of <hi>Italy</hi> to ſhut up every paſſage whence it might have relief, it did as much diſſerve <hi>France,</hi> who by fruſtrating the union of the Republick with the <hi>Griſons,</hi> helping to introduce the <hi>Spaniards</hi> there, it was clearly evident, that they prevailing in cunning, power, and money, would quickly exclude the <hi>French</hi> themſelves. <hi>Barbarigo</hi> could not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the oppoſition; therefore going on to his Ambaſſie for <hi>London,</hi> leaves in <hi>Zurich Chriſtofero Suriano</hi> Secretary, reſident in <hi>Helvetia.</hi> In the beginning of this year, the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> appeared at the head of a flouriſhing Army of 30000 men. The <hi>Savoyard</hi> had not above 17000; but if in the one, the valour of the General was wanting, in the other the courage of the Duke ſupplied it. The Prince of <hi>Caſtiglione,</hi> by order of <hi>Matthias,</hi> who complained that he had been left out in the project of Peace, and that the judgment of the Dukes pretenſions were deferred to others, ſends to <hi>Carlo</hi> the intimation of the Imperial Ban. He impriſoning him that ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put it into his hands amongſt other papers, appeals, with many proteſtations of obedience, to the Emperour himſelf, who, without much ado, at the interceſſion of the Dukes of <hi>Saxony,</hi> from whom the Houſe of <hi>Savoy</hi> boaſts its Original, lets all things fall into ſilence and oblivion. The Duke himſelf, by means of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news the project heretofore ſet on foot by <hi>Caſtiglione,</hi> of the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Marriages of <hi>Margaret,</hi> and <hi>Eleonora,</hi> with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Vittorio,</hi> with equal Dowries, and with a certain Parcel of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:53750:29"/>
which might regulate the Borders; but it behoving <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> to depend too much upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> it ſerved for nothing but to give time to <hi>Carlo,</hi> the better to juſtifie himſelf, and inveigh in diſcourſe, by endeavours, and in print, againſt the Government of <hi>Spain.</hi> For this purpoſe ſerved wonderfully certain Diſpatches directed from <hi>Madrid</hi> to <hi>Inoioſa,</hi> which falling into the hands of <hi>Carlo,</hi> gave him means to publiſh the Orders they contained, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Piedmont</hi> without delay, before the friends of <hi>Carlo,</hi> and thoſe that emulated the Crown, could be ready to relieve it. Upon this Intelligence, <hi>Carlo</hi> ſollicites thoſe far off, and ſtirs up thoſe that were near. But many believing, that a bridle was more neceſſary than ſpurs to his fiery ſpirit, in place of aſſiſtance counſelled him to incline to Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>James</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> hiding the intern weakneſs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom under a great Cloak of Authority, and honouring his own quiet with the name of Studies and Learning, contributes nothing but his good offices, commending him to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as a Prince animated with the ancient Genius, Valour, and Luſtre of <hi>Italy;</hi> and for a better appearance, orders his Ambaſſadour at <hi>Venice</hi> to go and reſide in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> forbid the Levies to the Count of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> which <hi>Carlo</hi> deſired, and in <hi>France</hi> ſome paid the penalty of having tranſgreſſed the Kings Orders, by going to ſerve him. <hi>Carlo,</hi> to juſtifie himſelf in that which was imputed to him, <hi>viz.</hi> that too immoderately he deſired War, calling one day the Miniſters of Princes, then with him, deſires their advice to what conditions they would counſel him to condeſcend, proteſting that bating Dignity, which was the Pupil of Principality, he was willing to any thing. The Ambaſſadours of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> applauding greatly his underſtanding of things, carried it to the Governour; but he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf not yet authorized, nothing could be done, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the reſolutions from <hi>Spain,</hi> whither the Senate with ſerious Letters to the King himſelf ceaſed not to exhort earneſtly to Peace.</p>
               <p>At laſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters explain themſelves; <hi>That at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of ſo many Princes the King did graciouſly overſee all that humiliation, which he might pretend from the Duke; but did require, for the publick Peace, his diſarming no leſs than the adjuſtment of the differences with</hi> Ferdinand. Upon which they declared themſelves more fully to <hi>Monſieur de Sillery: That it was to be understood, that</hi> Carlo, <hi>retaining convenient Garriſons, ſhould disband his Army, and the Emperour ſhould be Judge of their pretenſions of</hi> Monferrat; <hi>in the mean time, Hoſtility, and offences ceaſing, the places poſſeſſed with the Priſoners ſhould be reſtored.</hi> They promiſe moreover, <hi>ſo to diſpoſe of their Army, that no Prince of</hi> Italy <hi>ſhall have cauſe to be jealous of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being arrived at <hi>Turin,</hi> the Duke having always feared, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have him diſarm, the more eaſily to wound him, joyning to difficulty delays, denied to conſent, that thoſe that had followed his party, being Subjects of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſhould remain excluded from pardon, and that his own rights to <hi>Monferrat</hi> ſhould
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53750:29"/>
be buried for ever in the wonted tediouſneſs of the Imperial Court. With this he got ſo much time, that the Spring opened the field for the action of Armies. The events of the War had not hitherto been ſuitable to the power nor dignity of the Princes, imployed only in plundering, ſpoiling, and burning. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Chiefs in the mean time endeavoured to ſhew themſelves in more becoming Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The firſt occaſion was given by the Inhabitants of <hi>Roccau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano,</hi> who being weary of quartering ſome inſolent <hi>French,</hi> called in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to help to drive them away. The Marqueſs <hi>di Mortara,</hi> Governour of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who was very much one of thoſe who above all others kindled the fire, marched in great haſte with 5 or 6000 men, in hope that getting into that Town through a place in the Walls, which lay open to take alſo <hi>Cortemiglia,</hi> and ſo to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs <hi>Piedmont</hi> on that ſide, he might have the opportunity to do it much miſchief. But the Duke, who had a moſt vigilant eye to obſerve the firſt motions of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſends preſently St. <hi>Giorgio</hi> into <hi>Cortemiglia,</hi> and himſelf going from <hi>Turin</hi> with 7000 men, meets <hi>Mortara</hi> in <hi>Biſtagno,</hi> a place belonging to <hi>Monferrat,</hi> ſituated upon a height commanding a High way, which goes from the Sea into the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi> He attacques him there, and wanting his Cannon, which by reaſon of the ſpeedy march was ſtayed behind, he thought with the Spade to make a breach. But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with Muſkets and frequent Sallies killed ſome of the boldeſt in the Aſſault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inoioſa,</hi> at his wits end, to ſee the Dukes courage, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the loſs of thoſe men, which was the flower of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiery, haſtes thither with a great Body; neither did the Duke ſtir, till he ſaw him camped, and then with excellent order retires in his ſight without being moleſted. It was then generally reported, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by not following the Duke inferiour in ſtrength, loſt a ſignal Victory. But they marched away to <hi>Asti,</hi> a City lying on the Frontier of the Territory of the <hi>Alexandrino,</hi> environed with ſeveral parcels of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> with a Campagnia round about it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed with many little Hills of equal fertility and beauty. At the foot of theſe, the City ſtands upon a Plain; which afterwards pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently riſes and terminates, where an old Caſtle ſtands above it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of fortification or defence. The <hi>Tanara,</hi> a little way from it, runs from the Southward, and the <hi>Verſa</hi> a ſmall River on the other ſide. The City being of a large circuit, and the Walls old, the Duke, who was got thither firſt, places the hope of the defence in keeping the Enemy far off, intrenching himſelf both on the Hills, and in the Plain. The Governour, to diſturb <hi>Piedmont</hi> on all ſides, leaving about <hi>Sandoval</hi> 6000 Foot, and 500 Horſe, and by conſent of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> having placed Garriſons in St. <hi>Damiano</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lpiano,</hi> Towns of <hi>Monferrat</hi> the firſt on the ſide of <hi>Aſti,</hi> and the other juſt before <hi>Turin,</hi> found himſelf 24000 ſtrong in view of the Duke. The other not more than 15000 Foot, and 1500 Horſe, had intrenched them longſt the <hi>Verſa,</hi> and at the firſt appearing of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent a groſs of Cavalry towards them, they ingaged in a Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſo hot, that the Governour found it neceſſary to imploy all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53750:30"/>
his, when at laſt the <hi>Savoyard</hi> giving way to their number, <hi>Inoioſa</hi> had liberty to form his Camp. He deſigns afterwards, aſcending the Hillocks, to get behind the Duke, and conſtrain him to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Plain, and to command the Town it ſelf; for although <hi>Carlo</hi> had fortified ſome Poſts, nevertheleſs the ſhortneſs of time had not permitted him to perfect them. The Prince of <hi>Aſcoli</hi> then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Land of <hi>Caſtiglione,</hi> opens the way for that whole Army to march thither, and the <hi>Savoyards</hi> abandoning the Campagnia and the paſſages of the Rivers, betook themſelves to their own defence, making choice of two principal Poſts, the one committed to the <hi>French,</hi> the other to the <hi>Switzers,</hi> with ſome pieces of Cannon: Theſe two Nations making betwixt them 10000 Souldiers. Againſt the firſt came the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in a well-deſigned order, and <hi>Pietro Sermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ento,</hi> who led the Vantguard, attacqued them with great courage. The Cavalry of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who flanqued the Poſts in a Plain a little below, attempted in full ſpeed to ſtop them, but were repulſed by other Troops that interpoſed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> advanced booldly without loſing their order, but where now and then the ſtraitneſs of that way required it, or the Vollies of Muſkets made them to open. But where the firſt were killed, or wounded, the ſecond File taking their place, they gained the height, where they had not only liberty to put themſelves again into order, but plant two pieces of Cannon, by which the <hi>French</hi> taking fright, turned their backs. Certain Troops of Horſe, who endeavoured to rally them, and ſtop the Enemy, the place being ſteep and narrow, was the cauſe of greater confuſion and diſorder. <hi>Giovanni Bravo,</hi> which led the ſecond Battaglion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſeeing the firſt maſter of the field, marches beyond it, and gives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the flanck of the ſecond Poſt: neither was the reſiſtance greater there; for the <hi>Switzers,</hi> ſome flinging away their Arms, others for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting they had them, with their flight gave no occaſion of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpute. The Duke alone with equal ſkill both of a Prince, and a common Souldier, directing the fight, mingling himſelf where he apprehended diſorder, and either ſtaying where the danger was greateſt, or flying thither whither need required, gave proof of great valour by animating the weary, rallying the faint-hearted, and reproaching the fugitives. But he found it fit at laſt to yield to the cowardiſe of his own men, and the number of his Enemy: not to loſe all his Cannon, he cauſed two pieces to be flung off the Hill, and to be recovered in the night. Three others were brought into <hi>Alexandria</hi> in great triumph.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>Savoyards</hi> ſide <hi>Franciſco di Sylva,</hi> Brother of the Duke of <hi>Paſtrana,</hi> was Priſoner, and dyed a while after at <hi>Turin</hi> of the wounds he had received. The common opinion now was, that to proſecute this Victory, and make <hi>Italy</hi> tremble, nothing was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but <hi>Carlo</hi> at the Head of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, or the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army under the Colours of <hi>Carlo.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> halting there, gave time to the Enemy, who weak and much in diſorder, was retired into the Town to recruit their courage and ſtrength, in ſuch ſort,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53750:30"/>
that the one did not overcome, nor the other loſe. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour applies himſelf to fortifie a great Circumvallation, taking in Hills, and doubling Trenches and redoubts, to defend himſelf as if he had been the weakeſt, and in a condition ready to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The Duke keeping himſelf more cloſe, runs forth a line notwithſtanding, as if he would attacque the enemies Camp; and at laſt lays a Fort under their noſe, notwithſtanding many Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, and other Feats of War. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked and inſulted, breaking ground, run a line with many Works towards the Fort; but the <hi>Savoyards</hi> having taken and fortified another Poſt of certain houſes in the middle, turned another way. With Fire-batteries, but afar off, they play upon the City, and the Dukes Camp, who with 1800 men aſſaults the Quarter of <hi>Gamba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loina,</hi> burning their Parapet of <hi>Gabions,</hi> but were at laſt repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The Governour with his ſlackneſs made War to himſelf, and found the greateſt to ariſe from the Situation and the Elements. Upon the Hills they ſuffered for want of water, and the filth of the Army cauſing ſickneſs, men and beaſts dyed. Lodging in the open Air, the heat, the nouriſhment, the unripe fruits corrupted health. The Camp was not to be diſtinguiſhed from an Hoſpital or a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, ſo great was the number of the ſick and dead. From whence, although the Army was re-inforced with the Troops left at <hi>Sando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,</hi> and others come to them by Sea, it was nevertheleſs not half ſo ſtrong as when it ſate down before <hi>Aſti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo,</hi> as to his Quarters, had greater commodity, but in other things was in no leſs difficulty, becauſe his own Country being not able to ſupply the charges, he had ſo frequent experience of Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies among the ſtranger Militia for want of pay, that oftentimes he could not diſtinguiſh whether they were a greater burden or aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to him. In this ſtate of affairs <hi>Rambogliet</hi> arrives at <hi>Aſti,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cannon in honour of the Mediation ſuſpended their Battery. But the Duke even in this precipice of Fortune practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the arts of wit, interpoſed always the difficulties of requiring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſafety. <hi>Zeno,</hi> and the Ambaſſadour of <hi>England</hi> failed not to beſet the Duke with many reaſons, and he acknowledged, his happineſs lay in peace; but added, that as Fortune obliged him to yield to the more powerful, ſo to expoſe himſelf to dangers, to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and humiliation, were not the counſel of prudence, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his Fortune. He inſiſted upon the Governours diſarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or that the Republick might be the Warranty of the Peace: knowing in it to be ſtability of Government, and a faith not ſubject (as in the <hi>Pope,</hi> and in <hi>France</hi>) to the viciſſitude of time, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Princes, and the corruption of Miniſters. The Senate ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly weighed of what importance that was, becauſe great Princes not being to be conſtrained to performance but by the ſame faith with which they promiſe, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould profane theirs by reaſon of intereſt, the Republick put it ſelf into great trouble.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the deſire of Peace prevailing, they command <hi>Zeno</hi> to ſign, and over and above to promiſe aſſiſtance to the Duke,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53750:31"/>
when (others failing) <hi>France</hi> alone ſhould concur in it. Such orders arrive very opportunely in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> becauſe <hi>Rambogliet</hi> having a little before preſſed the Duke in vain with threatnings and proteſts to conſent to the Peace without any ſuch caution, was ready to take his leave, commanding thoſe of the Nation to follow him, and with much ado had yielded to a ſhort ſuſpenſion of his journey at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Ambaſſadours of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi> But <hi>Zeno</hi> giving his word, the Duke, who had dextrouſly directed his counſels to ſuch an end, threatned by one party, ſecured by another, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by all, under-writes the Treaty, which took its name from <hi>Aſti. Carleton</hi> and <hi>Zeno</hi> deliver it to <hi>Rambogliet;</hi> he and the Biſhop of <hi>Savona,</hi> the Nuntio ſucceeded to <hi>Savelli,</hi> carried it to the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> and being greedily received by him, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it with a Writing, which he put into the hands of the <hi>French.</hi> The Capitulation for diſarming contained, that the Duke, except ſome Companies of <hi>Switzers,</hi> ſhould within a month diſband the Strangers, and of his Subjects ſhould only keep on foot ſo many as ſufficed for Garriſons. He gave his word not to offend the States of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and to refer his pretenſions to the judgment of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. On the other ſide <hi>Rambogliet</hi> promiſes for <hi>France,</hi> that the Subjects of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> which had ſerved <hi>Carlo,</hi> ſhould, with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their perſons, be reſtored to the enjoyment of their eſtates; Priſoners and places to be reciprocally rendred: And for the Dukes ſecurity, <hi>France</hi> declares him to be in their protection to aſſiſt him with all their power, whenſoever he ſhould be moleſted by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards;</hi> and Orders were conſigned to him to oblige <hi>Dighieres</hi> to march to his aſſiſtance, without expecting other Commiſſion from the Court. And becauſe it was known, that ſome Levies were making by private perſons out of <hi>Italy</hi> in favour of <hi>Carlo,</hi> he was obliged to communicate the peace to his friends, and ſtop all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and on the other ſide it was agreed, that for ſix months the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould not require of him paſſage for <hi>Flanders.</hi> But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of retiring, it was alſo agreed, that the Duke at the intreaty of <hi>Rambogliet</hi> withdrawing 1000 Foot out of <hi>Asti,</hi> the Governour ſhould retire from the Hills to <hi>Croce bianca,</hi> and to <hi>Quarto,</hi> places belonging to the Juriſdiction of <hi>Aſti;</hi> after which <hi>Carlo,</hi> leaving a convenient Garriſon in the Town, ſhould remove his Army further off, and then the Governour ſhould return into the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> where, as to number and time, he ſhould ſo diſpoſe of the Army, that neither to <hi>Savoy,</hi> or any other, there ſhould remain any occaſion of ſuſpicion. In this manner the Duke ſeemed to have preſerved his dignity and indemnity, and <hi>Italy</hi> applauded him, and moſt eſpecially the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who with their Council had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Common Intereſt. By the Expedition, with which theſe firſt ſteps were accompliſhed, great hope was conceived, that all the reſt would have been duely executed; whereupon the <hi>Venetians</hi> reform a great part of their Militia, and reduced the payment of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal</hi> to 1000 Souldiers, giving paſſage to the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> for 500 <hi>Germans,</hi> which, as an independent Militia, he thought fit to bring in there.</p>

            <p>THE ſtormy blaſts of <hi>Piedmont</hi> quieted by the pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aſti,</hi> a continued diſſembled connivence of the Princes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> at the uncontroulable boldneſs of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi,</hi> amaſſed in the minds of the <hi>Venetians</hi> a great heap of reſentments and revenge. Some belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the ſuffering and permiſſion of the villanies of that moſt wicked people proceeded from the want of power in the <hi>Auſtrians;</hi> becauſe it being neceſſary, for keeping them in order, to maintain a Garriſon in <hi>Segna,</hi> the Archduke had not the means to defray the Charge. Others judged, that it was intereſt and profit to keep that Frontier of the <hi>Turks</hi> armed without charge, and beſides to exerciſe a certain pretended Juriſdiction, though a thieving one, by Sea. Neither did there want that thought, that the Archduke was incouraged by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> becauſe, having diſcovered, by what had paſſed in the affairs of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Republick to be jealous above all things of their own and others liberty, they took pleaſure to entertain and diſtract her in and by ſo troubleſom an exerciſe. This is certain, that if upon the continual complaints of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> the Emperour inclined to the remedy, thoſe of the Archdukes ſide did always infeeble his earneſt and interpoſed delays. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this, it fitly happened, that <hi>John Prainer,</hi> diſpatched by the Emperour as Commiſſioner to puniſh the inſolences, and find means that the Treaty of <hi>Vienna</hi> might be executed, was, when he came
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53750:32"/>
to <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Court, hindred from going forward, as if it were not ſeemly to yield, while in Arms, to Conditions, and during a Siege about thoſe places of refuge, where the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> were freely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, where their booties were kept, and the ſpoils, together with the dignity and patience of the Commonwealth, were publickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſale. The Garriſon in <hi>Fiume</hi> and other places were now increaſed with <hi>German</hi> Souldiers, who now and then aſſiſted the enterpriſes of the Pirates with ingaging the Colours and name of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Princes, who authorizing their tranſgreſſions, rendred the enduring of them more difficult, and unworthy of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> In the beginning of the year one action did much exaſperate mens minds, too much diſturbed already. For <hi>Antonio Giorgio,</hi> who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Iſle of <hi>Pago</hi> for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Scriſa</hi> juſt over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, where was <hi>Carlopago,</hi> a little Fortreſs, but a neſt of the moſt infamous amongſt the Pirates, ſuffered himſelf to be deluded by a falſe Treaty to attempt its ſurpriſe, and with ſix Barks only, and a few Souldiers, without the General <hi>Veniero</hi> his knowledge, was by concerted ſigns drawn on; but no ſooner diſbarked, but being received and environed with an Ambuſcade, left his life there with eighty others, part Souldiers, and part Inhabitants of <hi>Pago,</hi> whom he had brought along, as to a ſure Victory. His own Standard, with anothers Colours, and one Bark, remained in the hands of the enemy.</p>
            <p>This ſucceſs was variouſly interpreted by both parties; but in effect both reckoned themſelves offended, though amidſt ſo many diſſatisfactions there was occaſion given for Treaty; for that the Lieutenant of <hi>Piſino</hi> by his Letters to ſome of the chief <hi>Venetian</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, propoſed an interview of Commiſſioners, but <hi>Giorgio Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niani,</hi> Ambaſſadour for the Republick at the Emperours Court, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, <hi>That they were no more to treat about adjuſting differences or confines, but the faith of the Princes. That the Treaty of</hi> Vienna <hi>was in force, concluded by the Imperialiſts, and executed by the Republick. That to gratifie</hi> Matthias, <hi>Priſoners were ſet looſe, Guards removed; but on the other ſide, what was there practiſed but cruelty and rapine? That complaints had ſeveral times been made to the Emperour and Archduke of Iſlands laid waſte, the Sea infeſted, whole Territories given to ſpoil, of Colours taken, Gallies ſurpriſed,</hi> Patricians <hi>killed, ſome intrapped by fraud, and others drawn in by treaſon. On the other ſide doth there appear any Forces garriſoned in</hi> Segna, <hi>according to the agreement? Whence have the</hi> Uſcocchi <hi>been driven away, or where puniſhed? Are their Barks burnt? Are the Confines, the Subjects Navigation, and the Sea free? It is not denied but that the Emperour commands, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke diſpatches Miniſters; but let it be to execute the old agreements, and not to conteſt new ones. That the Republick, knowing common hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to conſiſt in Peace, was ready to forget what was paſt, but as much reſolved not to endure loſs and invaſions for the future.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons were admitted by the Emperours Miniſters; but being oppoſed by the Archdukes with various delays, gave occaſion for new accidents, which haſtned open War. <hi>Lorenzo Veniero,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53750:32"/>
of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> brought up from his youth in Sea-affairs, could not bear the memory of the Gally ſurpriſed, and the inſult of <hi>Giorgio</hi> killed. He obſerved <hi>Novi</hi> to lye before him (a place of the Juriſdiction of <hi>Frangipani</hi> upon the Sea-coaſt, and ſituated high) defended by ſome of thoſe Cannon, which being taken on the Gally aforeſaid, were brought in thither by the Count <hi>Niccolo,</hi> now Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Segna,</hi> in triumph and memory of the action. Reſolved therefore to cancel that indignity, and to get them again by force, diſimbarking men with Ladders and Petards ſurpriſed it by night. In the aſſault and fury of the Souldiers, all fell by the Sword who offered to reſiſt. All things were given to ſpoil; but the Church-furniture and ſacred Veſſels, not ſpared in that military licence, were upon ſevere inquiſition reſtored. The Town, with ſuch Barks as then there, was burnt; the Salt-pans deſtroyed, the Governour made Priſoner, but above all the Cannon of the Gally were brought away.</p>
            <p>They on the Archdukes ſide aggravated this ſucceſs as a manifeſt provocation of War, forgetting, as is uſual to them that do the wrong, the inſults which the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſuffered; who on the other ſide maintained, <hi>That they had no reaſon to reſpect the Walls and Dens of the</hi> Uſcocchi, <hi>more than they had preſerved the Towns, Waters, Ports, Confines, and Territories of the Republick, their Gallies and arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ships, which were their floating Fortreſſes.</hi> But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ſuch reaſons, ſequeſters the Revenues of the Subjects of the Commonwealth which lay in his Country, obliging the practice of the ſame towards thoſe of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> On the Borders of <hi>Iſtria</hi> they proſecute Hoſtility, both the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> alone, and often in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Archdukes Souldiery; whereupon ſome going out of <hi>Pogdavia,</hi> made prey of the Cattel of thoſe of <hi>Poppechio,</hi> who were not long without making themſelves amends. A while after, about 800 <hi>Germans,</hi> Souldiers, and Natives, returned from attempting an Incurſion of more moment. The <hi>Corſi,</hi> who guarded the Confines of the Republick, falling into their Rear, forced them to abandon their booty, and retire upon the <hi>Carſo;</hi> whence going deeper into the Country, they ſpoiled <hi>Cernicale</hi> and <hi>Cremoſich,</hi> Towns belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Benvenuto Petazzo,</hi> a turbulent Fellow, and who above all others troubled the Confines. The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> made an attempt upon <hi>Veglia,</hi> but were repulſed, and <hi>Felice Dobrovich</hi> ſcouring that River with armed Barks, deſtroyed and ſunk many of theirs. It was now foreſeen, that going thus on from irruptions to offences, it would quickly come to an open breach.</p>
            <p>Some Princes therefore interpoſed themſelves, and in particular Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> to <hi>Matthias,</hi> to the Republick, and to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted his inceſſant intreaties for Peace, complaining, that two of the principal powers of Chriſtendom ſhould fall to Wars, and kindle a fire on the Frontiers, and under the view of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who alone would enjoy the warmth and profit. His conſiderations to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick were; <hi>That having with ſo much wiſdom quenched the War of</hi> Piedmont, <hi>they would with the like zeal for publick good, paſs by offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53750:33"/>
and revenge.</hi> To the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> he repreſented <hi>The blemiſh, that redounded to their ſplendour of their Auguſt name, from the protection of Piratical Thieves and Robbers. That the</hi> Uſcocchi <hi>being now ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the abomination of the World, they ſhould give up to common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge that infamous ſacrifice made fat with the goods and blood of ſo many men.</hi> The <hi>Auſtrians</hi> anſwered with excuſes, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> inſiſted with reaſons; <hi>That there remained after ſo long time no place for a longer patience, but that which was unworthy of Principality. That they had for many years paſt by the inſolences of the</hi> Uſcocchi, <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of their Subjects, and the threatnings of the</hi> Turks. <hi>From the many relapſes they judged the remedy deſperate; and what then was there more to be expected? It was fit at laſt to do right to themſelves, and juſtice to their people, and to give protection to their Navigation. Proper defence is ſuggeſted from nature, from uſe, and from neceſſity. The burning of ſo many places were almoſt to be ſeen from the Capital City, and the crys of innumerable perſons afflicted heard there: Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, prayers, complaints themſelves had never had any effect. It was now in vain to propoſe Treaties, if thoſe already concluded were not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. The Senate had been willing, not once, but many times, not to appear ſuſpicious, to trust to promiſes; but it was not ſit out of too much credulity, to let her ſelf be any longer deluded. He was therefore to convert his offices to the</hi> Auſtrians, <hi>and with his paternal Authority require their obſervance of the things promiſed; for the conditions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, and the proceedings ſince, made it eaſily to be diſcerned, who it was that was againſt Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this inſtant of time happens to be propoſed in the Imperial Court a ſuſpenſion of Arms, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> accept it for two months; during which, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> were to abſtain from their courſes, and to be removed from their maritime places. But the Archduke refuſes the preſcription of time; whereupon, by new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Princes, the Senate gives conſent, that there ſhould be a ceſſation without limit, with promiſe nevertheleſs, that during the ſame, the miſchiefs ſhould be remedied, by cutting them up by the root, which could no otherwiſe be done, but by removing the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi.</hi> The Archduke then pretended, that the Guards before <hi>Segna</hi> and other places ſhould be removed; but the <hi>Venetians,</hi> taught by former experience, would not without further ſecurity conſent. Thus, while they differed in opinion about the Treaty, Hoſtility going on, and growing hotter, <hi>Petazzo,</hi> to repair his loſſes, attempts the Villages of <hi>Hoſpo,</hi> and <hi>Gobrovizza</hi> in <hi>Istria;</hi> but being repulſed by the Guards, ſpends all his ſpight againſt <hi>Benedetto da Legge,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor in that Province, publiſhing him baniſhed with a ſevere ſentence. <hi>Legge</hi> proceeds againſt <hi>Petazzo</hi> in a way of juſtice, he having firſt practiſed the ſame thing. Then applying himſelf to more proper reſentments, he burns the Town of St. <hi>Servolo, Prebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nich, Poghdaria,</hi> and <hi>Polina.</hi> Thence going down to ſpoil the Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits of <hi>Trieſte</hi> (a thing heretofore for the Dominion of the Sea pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Republick in more quiet times;) with about 800 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers under <hi>Fabio Gallo,</hi> Colonel; provoked thoſe of <hi>Trieſt</hi> to come
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53750:33"/>
forth firſt with ſome Horſe and 300 Foot, which afterwards, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Wolfango Frangipani,</hi> Earl of <hi>Terſaco,</hi> come in with a great number of <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi,</hi> found themſelves ſtrong 20 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Foot, and 300 Horſe. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> who having ſome armed Barks on the ſhore, had put hand to the work, ſeeing the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſo much exceeding in number, reſolved to retire, and putting their men into two Squadrons, take the way towards <hi>Muglia,</hi> which along the Sea is ſo narrow, that being aſſaulted by the Archduca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, the Rear led by <hi>Gallo</hi> himſelf, could receive no aſſiſtance from thoſe in the Van; nevertheleſs withſtood the Charge ſo long, till finding the paſſage a little too open, he was able to put himſelf in better order. But <hi>Gallo</hi> killed by a Muſket-ſhot, his men fell into confuſion, in ſuch ſort that the other Squadron, commanded by <hi>Legge,</hi> falling into the ſame, the field with 200 dead, many wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſome Priſoners, was left to the enemy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> animated hereby, ſpoiled five Villages, and in the Territory of <hi>Monfalcon</hi> burnt ſeven, beſides two plundered. Upon theſe ſucceſſes <hi>Veniero,</hi> to give courage to the people with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Fleet, comes to the <hi>Iſtrian</hi> ſhore, puts a Garriſon into <hi>Albona, Fianona,</hi> and other maritime places, and with eight Gallies attempts to take <hi>Moſchenizza;</hi> but, the ſtone of which the Wall was made being Cannon-proof, and the ſeaſon not permitting a longer ſtay, retires further off, after he had laid waſte for 15 miles in length the appurtenances of <hi>Monte Major.</hi> A deſign, the <hi>Germans</hi> now had upon St. <hi>Vincenti,</hi> ſucceeded not, but the <hi>Venetians</hi> made ſpoil of <hi>Cherſano,</hi> and then left it, not to be ingaged in the Siege of the Caſtle and the Church, which was fortified. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> from theſe little doings called to greater thoughts, and preparations, diſpatched to the places moſt expoſed their Lieutenants Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; and choſe <hi>Pietro Barbarigo,</hi> Procurator, Commiſſary General of the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> and for General, <hi>Marco Loredano;</hi> with whom, for the better directing the affairs of the Army and War, they ſent <hi>Paulo Aemilio Martinengo,</hi> giving Commiſſion for 4000 <hi>Italians</hi> and ſome few <hi>Corſi.</hi> Theſe preparations went not ſo faſt forward, as invaſions and offences did. The Senate knew, that their great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage conſiſted in prevention, and firmly believed, that from the Mediation of Princes, the clamour of Subjects, and the damage of his own Country, the Archduke would be induced to fulfil the Treaty of <hi>Vienna.</hi> But the event ſucceeded not ſo happily as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was prudent, by reaſon of the nature of War, which, contrary to a Labyrinth, admits not of a going out the ſame way you go in. And though now the ſeaſon grew towards the end of the year, the Senate ordered <hi>Franciſco Erizzo</hi> General of <hi>Palma,</hi> that ſending forth ſome Forces under <hi>Pompeo Juſtiniano,</hi> he ſhould poſſeſs thoſe open places, which lay on this ſide the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> and lodge them there to hinder the paſſage of the Archdukes people; who gave out they would build Forts, and over-run the Country to the Walls of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> It is here neceſſary to deſcribe that part of the Country, wherein, as in a Theatre, we ſhall preſently ſee the War confined,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53750:34"/>
which was made by puiſſant Forces, but ballanced; carried on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt many diſtractions and reſervations with unequal ſucceſs, but at laſt overcome by the Republick with Treaties more than Arms, and was followed with great jealouſies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſtria,</hi> a Peninſula of the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> confines with <hi>Croatia,</hi> where the Limits of the <hi>Austrians</hi> ſeparate thoſe of the <hi>Venetians</hi> from the <hi>Turks.</hi> The County of <hi>Piſino,</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> comes in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt; and <hi>Trieſte,</hi> which gives name to a little Bay or Gulph, faces upon the Sea. Beyond on this ſide are the Mountains of <hi>Carſo,</hi> not ſteep, but rough and craggy, and may well be called one great ſtone; amidſt theſe incompaſſed by the Sea and <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> lies in <hi>Friuli</hi> the Territory of <hi>Montfalcon,</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Venetians;</hi> but where thoſe Hills terminate near to the River before mentioned, a large Plain extends it ſelf to the <hi>Julian</hi> Alps, which in ancient times was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made the door to let in the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and in theſe latter Ages the high way for the <hi>Turks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Goritia,</hi> which gives the name to a County, is ſituate in this Plain, leaning to a Hillock, which in its aſcent leads to the top of the Caſtle. It is defended by a ſtrong Tower, there is a Bridge there over the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> beyond which the Campagnia extends it ſelf with many Towns upon ſome little Hills. Five miles lower upon the right ſhore of the River, lies <hi>Gradiſca</hi> built upon a Rock, of the form of an oblong ſquare, with a good Caſtle, and heretofore garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by the <hi>Venetians</hi> againſt the Incurſions of the <hi>Turks.</hi> It hath beyond the <hi>Liſonzo</hi> the Mountains of <hi>Carſo,</hi> directly oppoſite, and on this ſide many Towns environ it, as <hi>Lucinis, Cormons, Medea, Fara, Romans,</hi> and other places of leſs moment; which nevertheleſs in the progreſs of the War will become ſo many Ports, and ſo many Forts, which will conſume Armies and Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Towards the Mountains, out of which riſeth the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> the Country is ſtraitned with certain narrow Vallies bordering on <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niola,</hi> and other Provinces of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> who towards the Sea command certain Villages, and in <hi>Maranuto, Caſtel Porpeto</hi> and <hi>Aquileia,</hi> though of theſe there remains nothing but the ruines and the name, kept Souldiers. In thoſe parts on this ſide the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> made their Invaſion, nor was it difficult to poſſeſs every place; for except <hi>Medea,</hi> which they got with approaches and Trenches, though it was in vain to reſiſt, every one yielded at the firſt appearance. The Garriſons without much ado quit the Tower of <hi>Aquilea, Caſtel Porpeto,</hi> and <hi>Maranuto,</hi> which were demoliſhed. On the other ſide of the <hi>Liſonzo, Eliſeo Pierantoni</hi> and <hi>Hugo Crutta,</hi> for a diverſion, marched out of <hi>Monfalcon,</hi> and took in <hi>Sagra,</hi> then left it: and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peo Juſtiniano</hi> did the ſame with <hi>Lucinis,</hi> which was afterward much repented; for had it been kept, it might have ſerved to get the Bridge, and the Tower upon the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> and by them to have ſtraitned <hi>Gradiſca</hi> from ſuccours; and paſſing to the other ſide of the River, which was ſo many times after attempted in vain, might not only have ſhut up <hi>Goritia</hi> on all ſides, but taken it alſo, being open and expoſed; as was the counſel of <hi>Marc Antonio Manzano.</hi> But
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53750:34"/>
the Orders of the Senate containing only to lodge in the Archdukes Country in <hi>Campagnia,</hi> without attacquing places, as not willing to divide into ſo many parts their men, which conſiſted for the moſt part of Trained-bands, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> took up his Quarters in the Towns of <hi>Meriano</hi> and <hi>Cormons.</hi> The <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> in diſorder at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Colours, applied themſelves with all ſpeed to a vigorous defence. <hi>Gradiſca</hi> was fortified by <hi>Ricchardo Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoldo,</hi> its Governour. The Count of <hi>Terſaco</hi> puts himſelf into <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritia,</hi> and the Baron <hi>Adam de Trautmanſtorf</hi> arriving ſoon after with Title of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> General, ordered Repairs and Garriſons for both thoſe places, fortifying <hi>Rubia, St. Floriano, Vipulzano,</hi> and <hi>Dobra</hi> on this and that ſide of the <hi>Liſonzo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This firſt Rumour of War being ſpread abroad, ſad judgments were made of it, and the Princes diſcovered in themſelves thoughts and reflections of no leſs. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> offers the Senate himſelf, his Sons, his States, and his Army; and others were not wanting to animate to greater deſigns. In orders to which, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadour being returned from <hi>Turin</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Republick to reflect upon the ſtate of things, while the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> linked together by Marriages, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire at preſent in the ſame Maxims to divide betwixt them, what with Negotiations, what with Arms, the Arbitrement of <hi>Italy</hi> and the world, offered a League with his King; who, though ſeparated by ſituation, yet never by authority and prudence to the common Intereſt, might with the moveable Bridge of his Fleet upon the vaſt Ocean, joyn <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Italy.</hi> He remonſtrated the aſſociation of the Northern Princes againſt the vaſt deſigns of the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria;</hi> and conſidering that thoſe friendſhips were never remote, which were made upon the ground of common Concern, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Republick to joyn their reputation and wiſdom to that League, aſſuring them they ſhould find a candid heart and warm ſpirits amongſt thoſe people, who are thought to have Sea and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for their Element and Climate.</p>
            <p>The Senate, with many wary and reſpectful anſwers, entertains and cheriſhes theſe good diſpoſitions; but in their moderate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, did not conſent to conjoyn their Intereſts with thoſe of Princes ſo far remote. As to the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> in a belief, that the Peace of <hi>Aſti</hi> was ſecure, <hi>Rambogliet</hi> had taken his leave of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> but was no ſooner gone, but the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> denying to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his conſent to the oblivion, proceeded to execution againſt the Rebels. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> interpoſing themſelves, obtain, that ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any further act, he ſhould yield that to their intreaties, which they perceived for decency he would not yield to authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carlo,</hi> as to the point of diſarming, proceeds with great caution: becauſe he had a mind to hear the judgment of <hi>Spain</hi> concerning the Treaty of <hi>Aſti;</hi> and although he had diſcharged thoſe of the Vallies and the <hi>French,</hi> yet he had with them recruited ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of <hi>Savoyards,</hi> and delayed to diſcharge the <hi>Swizzers,</hi> upon a difficulty riſen about the accounts of their pay, and becauſe the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53750:35"/>
Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> had denied them paſſage. Theſe on the other ſide ſet at liberty no Priſoners, nor were the places poſſeſſed reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally rendred, the Duke himſelf not caring to be thought advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged by the acquiſition of ſome far Fiefs. The truth was, that at <hi>Madrid,</hi> upon the advice of the Peace, there was obſerved a long and ſevere ſilence both in the King and his Miniſters, but diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were univerſally publiſhed ſo much the more licencious againſt <hi>Mendoza,</hi> thought a man equally weak in the management of Civil and Military affairs. It was nevertheleſs evident to thoſe of the beſt Judgment, that the facility contributed by him, proceeded from ſecret orders from the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> to the end the Marriages with <hi>France</hi> might be accompliſhed without diſturbances; after which, and the exchange of the Brides, a change of Councils pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently appeared. <hi>Spain</hi> in that buſineſs did certainly keep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed one great Stratagem of their Secrets; and had therefore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Court of <hi>France</hi> all aſſiſtance againſt whomſoever ſhould diſturb her; becauſe the States of that Kingdom having for a ſhew been called and ſeparated with good words only, and the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees to whom the reformation of abuſes were committed done nothing, the male-contents had again united themſelves to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and endeavoured to ſtir up the <hi>Hugonots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen, that for her own intereſt was reſolved, the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, whatever came of it, ſhould be accompliſhed, ſending the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſhal <hi>de Boiſdauphin</hi> with an Army into <hi>Champagne</hi> to oppoſe the united Princes, and giving the Command of another to the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> to be her Convoy on the Journey, parts from <hi>Paris</hi> with her Sons; and arrives in <hi>October</hi> upon the Confines of <hi>Spain,</hi> whither King <hi>Philip</hi> was come alſo. The Kingdoms ſhewing equal magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, each giving and receiving the Brides, it looked neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as if <hi>France</hi> only were to change Intereſt. The little River <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſſo,</hi> which ſeparates the two Kingdoms, joyns together at preſent the Spouſes, and nothing was wanting of that, which from ambition and luxury could be added to the greatneſs of the Princes. At the ſame inſtant of time, the two Princeſſes in Boats looſing from the reſpective ſhores, and it being obſerved, that in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Boat there was a Globe, repreſenting the World, placed under the Crown and Trophies of Arms, the <hi>French</hi> would have it put out, preſaging, as time, the ordinary Judge of Events, hath ſince made appear, that from this Marriage, in which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> placed the ſtrongeſt foundation of the univerſal Monarchy, is ſeaſonably ſprung up that contention, which more than ever hath oppoſed it.

               <p>In the very end of the year paſt, <hi>Marco Anthonio Memo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> dying, <hi>Giovanni Bembo</hi> gave happy preſages to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, being taken up from the Procuratorſhip of St. <hi>Marco</hi> into the higheſt dignity, after having gone through conſiderable Imployments, and the Command of the Sea; a perſon of much ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and a decrepit age, as is uſual in the Government, in which men riſe to the height by long ſteps of merit, and not by the favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wings of Fortune. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> in the beginning of this currant year, acquainting the Princes with the motion of their Arms, and informing them of the neceſſity of making uſe of them, added alſo their intentions to be as much diſtant from the deſire of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53750:36"/>
Conqueſts, or the enlarging their State, as they ſhould be inclined to Peace, when the cauſes of ſo many calamities being removed, the Treaty of <hi>Vienna</hi> ſhould be put in practice; the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> ſhould be ſent far from the Sea, that is, they which imploy themſelves in Piracy, and under three diſtinct names of Adventurers, Hirelings, and Outlawed, formed but one Colluvies of people; who without other profeſſion but thieving, had wickedneſs for their trade. The Archduke on his part failed not to repreſent to the Courts his ſenſe and complaints of being invaded in his own Country; which were variouſly hearkned to, according to the diverſity of intereſts and diſpoſitions. The Pope and <hi>France</hi> declared themſelves to imploy their offices for Peace with equal zeal and affection. In <hi>Spain</hi> the Miniſters at firſt ſeemed in ſuſpence, yet offered their interpoſition; and <hi>Toledo</hi> contented perhaps that the War ſhould go on, declared publickly in <hi>Milan,</hi> that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had reaſon to ſeek juſt repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; but ſoon after, ſeeking War more than the cauſe, they changed their mind. Although ſome diſcourſes, to give jealouſie to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> were ſcattered abroad of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> neareſt Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Emperor and <hi>Maximilian</hi> Archduke of <hi>Insbruch:</hi> yet neither of them departed from Neutrality; and the Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> went no further than intreaties for the Peace and good Offices.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> appointing <hi>Ottavian Bono</hi> for Ambaſſadour Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary in <hi>France,</hi> cauſed <hi>Vincenzo Guſſoni,</hi> who had ſerved in that Court for Ordinary, to take his way to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to improve the affections of thoſe Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> which called themſelves of the Union, to the end to oppoſe them to the Emperour, if he ſhould take part in the Intereſts of his Couſin with Arms, and in the mean time inform them of the whole affair, and of their reaſons not at all ſeparated from ſincere deſires of Peace; which produced ſuch an effect, that the Duke of <hi>Wittemberg,</hi> Head of it, offered to ſend an Ambaſſadour to <hi>Vienna</hi> to mediate the Peace, and the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> moved <hi>Matthias</hi> with Letters very effectual. But with <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> the Negotiation proceeded not with a pace equal to the common deſire; for that <hi>Matthias</hi> ſolliciting him for a ſuſpenſion of Arms, accepted by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he offended at the Invaſion of his Country, ſends <hi>Ecchemberg</hi> to the Emperour, to offer him conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, how great the reſentment ought to be after ſuch offences; and in caſe it ſhould be thought neceſſary to admit of a Truce, he yet underſtood that the places taken ſhould be firſt reſtored. On the other ſide, the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſcorned ſuch an extravagant Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſeemed abſurd to all, even to <hi>Toledo</hi> himſelf, the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never preceding the Agreement. They notwithſtanding offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in caſe the Treaty of <hi>Vienna</hi> were accompliſhed within two months, to render all. An offer, which being not only approved, but commended by the Emperours Miniſters, was notwithſtanding rejected by thoſe of the Archduke, to the great advantage of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> becauſe not liking that cauſe which condemned it ſelf, the Emperour angry at the Archdukes backwardneſs, did for ever deny him thoſe aſſiſtances, which he thought were due to the common
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53750:36"/>
intereſt of the Family, and which he ſollicited with great earneſt, and reproach ſometimes to the Favourite as long as any Hoſtility remained.</p>
               <p>Thus the War from Injuries goes on to Treaties of Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and now at laſt to new Ingagements, contrary perhaps to the belief of thoſe themſelves that were ingaged in it. Now, to ſay truth, were the preparations proportionable to the motions in ſeveral parts; for the <hi>Venetians</hi> in particular having, in hopes of Peace in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> diſbanded a good number of their Militia, found their Army not ſufficient for their neceſſity. Therefore till men could be raiſed, they ſent into <hi>Friuli</hi> the Militia of the Territories thereabouts; and from the Archdukes ſide, notwithſtanding the ſnow, Troops came down from the Mountains. Thoſe of <hi>Trieſte</hi> with thirty Barks ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily got together, attempted to make ſome diſturbance, but were quickly by <hi>Giovanni Giacomo Zane,</hi> who ſucceeded in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Generalſhip of <hi>Veniero,</hi> with certain Gallies repulſed. Thoſe of the Archduke over-running the Territory of <hi>Pola,</hi> were alſo driven back. At the ſame time, in the Country of <hi>Montfalcon,</hi> the Count <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand Scotto</hi> put to flight 500 men, which attempting to plunder it, he obliged to leave their booty. To enlarge the way for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Proviſions, <hi>Franciſco Juſtiniano</hi> had a mind to attempt <hi>Vipol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zano;</hi> but his party being but ſmall, and thoſe that defended it more numerous, he retired without doing any thing. <hi>Daniello Anthonino</hi> with 300 Horſe, ſtops a Party of the Enemy near <hi>Dobra,</hi> which ran up and down the Country, and had wholly defeated them, if he had had foot with him to have forced a ſtrong houſe into which they retired; but a little while after, he meets in a more open Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnia <hi>Daniel Francol</hi> of <hi>Trieſte,</hi> one of the principal troublers of <hi>Iſtria,</hi> who being come out of <hi>Gradiſca</hi> with 300 Muſquetiers, was ſo beſet, that after a brave defence, himſelf, together with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of his men, were killed. The General <hi>Barberigo,</hi> at his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into <hi>Friuli,</hi> reſolves by means of a Ford over the <hi>Liſonzo</hi> to poſſeſs <hi>Chiavoretto,</hi> where near to its Fountain the River is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained betwixt the Hills. But <hi>Hettore Savorgnano,</hi> who had the Command to attempt it, underſtanding by the way, more from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port than truth, that it was too well provided, returns without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting other than that the Archdukes people, comprehending the deſign and importance of the Poſt, put a ſtronger Garriſon into it. <hi>Trautmanſtorf,</hi> having in this interim ſtrengthened himſelf, plants a Fort betwixt <hi>Goritia</hi> and <hi>Gradiſca,</hi> to aſſure the communication of thoſe two places; after that, raiſes another on the other ſide of the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> called the <hi>Trinity,</hi> upon the Hills of <hi>Lucinis;</hi> obliging the <hi>Venetians</hi> to oppoſe one at <hi>Medea,</hi> and to contract their Quarters.</p>
               <p>To ſecond the deſigns in <hi>Friuli,</hi> the General <hi>Loredano</hi> marching into <hi>Iſtria</hi> with 2300 Foot, 150 Horſe, and two pieces of Cannon, took <hi>Antignano,</hi> a great Town in the County of <hi>Piſino,</hi> and left it garriſoned. By Sea <hi>Giovanni Giacomo Zane</hi> coming to <hi>Moſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizza,</hi> takes it after two days reſiſtance, and afterwards <hi>Barzech</hi> by aſſault. But in <hi>Friuli Pompeo Juſtianiano,</hi> made <hi>Maeſtro di Campo</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53750:37"/>
General, offers himſelf to beſiege <hi>Gradiſca</hi> as a thing of no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, deſigning with Trenches and approaches to enter into the Ditch, and afterwards with Batteries and Mines to bring it to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, notwithſtanding that by means of the Hills of <hi>Carlo,</hi> which were directly oppoſite on the other ſide of the River, there was an open paſſage for relief; and that being ſituate upon a Rock, there was not much hurt or loſs to be feared from the Cannon or the Spade.</p>
               <p>It being reſolved with better hope than counſel to attempt it, about the midſt of <hi>February</hi> with 2000 Foot and 500 Horſe he takes in <hi>Fara,</hi> which on the upper ſide lies upon the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> betwixt <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinis</hi> and <hi>Gradiſca.</hi> He ſoon after abandons it to amuſe the Enemy with the uncertainty of his deſigns; but having viewed the place, returns unexpectedly thither with the whole Body, and intrenching himſelf, fortifies the chief Quarter which hindred relief to the Town by the River. The reſt of the line, but that very large, was drawn on this ſide the River from <hi>Cormons, Medea,</hi> and <hi>Meriano</hi> with Guards of Horſe between. The Army lying at large and about many Poſts, conſiſted of 12000 men, of which all could not be called Souldiers, in an age, in which men were rather bought than choſen, and at a time when the <hi>Venetians</hi> were enough unprovided of a ſtranger Militia. There was within the Town, beſides <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoldo,</hi> the Governour <hi>Giovanni Perino</hi> a <hi>Walloon,</hi> with a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of 1200 men. They ſeeming to make little account of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque, ſuffered the <hi>Venetians</hi> to carry on their approaches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbance. Only <hi>Trautmanſtorf</hi> with the Horſe frequently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted the Camp; but the Skirmiſhes went on with equal ſucceſs, without contributing the leaſt to the iſſue of the buſineſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other reflection but to have been the cauſe of the death, by a Cannon-bullet, of <hi>Daniello Anthonini,</hi> a valiant Souldier. To the common ſorrow for this accident the Senate adds teſtimonies of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his Brothers; and to encourage Poſterity, cauſed an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Monument to be ſet up for him in the Cathedral of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dine.</hi> Some Works being finiſhed, four Batteries with 24 pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non on them were raiſed in the Camp, ſome playing upon the Port filled with earth, and the Baſtions, others ruining the houſes. Some of the Enemies Cannon were diſmounted, and a Cavalier or Catt beat down. Howſoever the effect of the Cannon imitating a Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt, which with a great rumbling for the moſt part doth little hurt, was not anſwerable to the noiſe. A Half-moon defended the Wall, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> entring into the Ditch, tryed to mine it; but the ſtone being hard, whilſt they were labouring to pierce into it below, thoſe within had time to cut off a place of retreat above; but ſeeing themſelves ſtraightned, they at laſt make a Sally at break of the day with three Troops, one at the head of the approaches, the other upon the flanks, and forcing away, the firſt Guards, which negligently kept that Work, they enter the Trenches. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> was ſeaſonably preſent; but diſturbed at the fright of his own, and the boldneſs of the Enemy, and being put hard to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53750:37"/>
thoſe that abandoned him, and thoſe that purſued him, hardly eſcaped from being taken. But getting at laſt into a Fort that was near, the Enemy ſtopped not but at the firſt redoute at the Battery, where <hi>Lelio Martinengo</hi> was with his Regiment, with which giving courage to the run-aways, and with the Cannon, the Enemy being put to a ſtand, he forces them to retire. Four Companies of the <hi>Venetians</hi> were defeated; two Captains were killed, and one made Priſoner. A relief of ſome <hi>Corſi</hi> arrived at this time from <hi>Fara,</hi> and ſupplied their place in the Trenches, which the Enemy might in that diſorder eaſily have ſlighted, and filled up the Mine, if they had not alone made it their buſineſs to purſue thoſe that fled from them. The Beſiegers, to retain their credit, attempted to ſtorm it. <hi>Oratio Baglione,</hi> who commanded the firſt Squadron, made a brave aſſault, and forced the Enemy to betake themſelves to their cutting off; but being hurt in the face with a ſtone, and many of his men killed about him, and <hi>Franciſco Juſtiniano</hi> for private grudge not ſeconding him, as it was his charge to do, he was conſtrained to retire. At laſt ſpringing the Mine, eight <hi>French</hi> Souldiers, hired by reward, hazarded themſelves at the head of ſome others to climb the breach, which was wide enough. But three running away before they came to grapple, and the five not being ſeconded by a Troop which ſhould have followed them, two of them were killed, one taken Priſoner, and the other, after having been in the breach, retired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> ſeeing that neither Courage nor Fortune favoured the enterpriſes, getting together a good number of Pioneers, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſtraighten the Town more nearly, and to change the place of the attacque. Upon the firſt report of the Siege of <hi>Gradiſca,</hi> the Archduke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> trys more than ever to ſtir up the Emperour to aſſiſt him; but he refuſing to depart from mediation, did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but nominate two Commiſſaries in <hi>Italy,</hi> which were <hi>Coſmo</hi> Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to the end they might procure an adjuſtment of Peace; but they imployed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in it but ſome offices and the name. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters taking for a pretext that their King was allied to the Archduke, thought the Conjuncture very fit for their deſign to promote their greatneſs in <hi>Italy,</hi> that the Republick ſhould be imployed elſewhere; and therefore declared in <hi>Madrid,</hi> that they could do no leſs than aſſiſt <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> and the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> ſending the Marqueſs <hi>Andrea Manriquez di Lara</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> he preſſed, that to make way for a Treaty, the Siege might be removed from <hi>Gradiſca,</hi> his King promiſing to interpoſe with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for a ſuſpenſion of Arms, and offering that the Town ſhould remain in the preſent ſtate, without repairing or bettering any thing. This office was not free from jealouſie, becauſe at that very time <hi>Gamboloita</hi> lodging in <hi>Giara</hi> upon the <hi>Adda,</hi> environed the Territory of <hi>Crema;</hi> and there being 24 pieces of Cannon mounted in <hi>Pavia,</hi> it was given out, that 8000 Souldiers under the Command of <hi>Zanchio Luna, Caſtillan</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi> ſhould move towards the Confines of the Republick. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53750:38"/>
kept the Frontier on that ſide well provided; however the Army in <hi>Friuli,</hi> by ſuch a diverſion, remained much weakned, and by the Ingagement of the Army it ſelf, the Frontier was much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p>The Popes Nuntio and other Miniſters of the Princes interceded with the Republick, if not for a Treaty, at leaſt by connivence for a forbearance of Hoſtility; whereupon the Senate, conſidering the inſtances of ſo many, the difficulty of what they had undertaken, and the diſtractions in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> anſwered in the ſame ſenſe to all, <hi>That remembring the paſt provocations, the injuries long ſuffered, and laſt of all their declared inclination to Peace; for a greater proof of it they were contented to ſlacken the Siege, and withdraw the Batteries, to give time to them, the Mediators, that imploying their affectionate offices to the Archduke, he might be induced to take away the cauſes of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, which depended wholly upon the</hi> Uſcocchi.</p>

The Negotiation upon theſe terms ſeemed in a fair way: but it was not long before it changed its aſpect, the Pope making a Propoſition, that the places poſſeſſed ſhould be depoſited; a thing no ways plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the <hi>Venetians;</hi> becauſe, beſides the doubt of relapſing into the former ſlackneſs, and delays, it ſeemed no eaſie matter to make choice of one, into whoſe hands to depoſite them, while the Pope being very aged, could not diſpoſe of the will of his Succeſſors, who for the moſt bring along with them new affections and intereſts. The Emperour and <hi>Spaniards</hi> were too near allied to one of the parties, and ſuſpected by the other, the leſſer Princes falling not under conſideration, as wanting power and credit, to maintain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and right againſt force. <hi>Manriquez</hi> then arriving a ſecond time at <hi>Venice,</hi> the Negotiation is made more difficult than before; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe perſwading himſelf to obtain every thing with the ſame faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, he propoſes, <hi>That</hi> Ferdinand <hi>giving his word to</hi> Toledo, <hi>that the Commanders and moſt miſchievous of the</hi> Uſcocchi <hi>ſhould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be removed, the Republick ſhould preſently reſtore what they poſſeſſed in</hi> Friuli <hi>and</hi> Iſtria, <hi>after which</hi> Don Ferdinand <hi>ſhould execute the foreſaid remove, and the differences be adjuſted within a term limited.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> highly offended, made this complaint, <hi>That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions were by the Governour made worſe, in place of better, which they expected, in proportion to the reſpect they had ſhewed to his offices, and that he pretended to perſwade them to a reſtitution upon the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of that which might afterwards be agreed on, the apparent ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſome few not ſufficing to take away the encouragement from ſo great a number of ſuch miſchievous Villains.</hi>

In

the Emperours Court things were treated more calmly; becauſe the Archduke thinking it beſt to endeavour to adjuſt an agreement without ſpeaking of a ceſſation of Arms, the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany</hi> propoſed, <hi>That to reconcile the diffidence of the Parties, and the punctilio, the reſtitution of places poſſeſſed on the one ſide, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the promiſes on the other ſhould be practiſed piece by piece al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatively, ſo that one Article ſhould be the defence of the other;</hi> A Propoſition which then came to nothing, but was the foundation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of the Peace, though with ſome protraction of time; for it was neceſſary that it ſhould be ripened under another Climate more remote. The Republick in this manner toſſed to and fro with Hoſtility, with Jealouſies, and with Treaties, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was not much more quiet, but being hurried about amidſt no leſs ſuſpicions, it happened, that his intereſts were interwoven with thoſe of the Republick; nay in ſuch ſort ingrafted, as may be ſaid that the cauſe became common, and therefore the Narrative with equal exactneſs ought not to be omitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo</hi> covering with a profound diſſimulation the jealouſie he had of <hi>Toledo,</hi> ſends at his arrival in <hi>Milan</hi> the Seignor <hi>de Parela,</hi> not ſo much to complement him, as to penetrate his intentions, and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate to him the conveniencies in fulfilling the Treaty of <hi>Aſti,</hi> with reſtitutions and diſarming. If the Governour was new in his Office, he ſhewed himſelf alſo a very Novice in the diſcourſe of Treaties and Peace, and ſo clearly expreſſes himſelf; <hi>That he knew not to what a powerful King could be obliged: That he was bound to no Law or Contract, but his own moderation and clemency. And if</hi> Carlo <hi>would make tryal of it, and caſt himſelf upon his favour and Royal arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſhould experience that the bounty of a great Prince is the only reſtraint of his power.</hi> As to the diſarming he declares, <hi>That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the King, the State of</hi> Italy, <hi>the Motions of the</hi> Venetians, <hi>and the Concernments of</hi> Ferdinand <hi>did not permit it.</hi> From ſuch an anſwer was clearly underſtood the ſum of <hi>Toledo</hi>'s inſtructions to conſiſt in breaking the Treaty of <hi>Aſti,</hi> to re-eſtabliſh either by Arms or Treaty the pre-eminency of that Crown in <hi>Italy.</hi> The Duke nevertheſs upon his perſwaſions is reduced to write into <hi>Spain,</hi> and make ſome kind of excuſe for the things paſt, and preſs for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of that Treaty; but at the ſame time came Orders to the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> to preſs the Duke to aſk pardon, to refer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf concerning the Capitulation to the Royal Favour, and that <hi>Maurice</hi> the Cardinal his Son ſhould go to the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this being a bitter Pill for <hi>Carlo</hi> to ſwallow, <hi>Toledo</hi> ſweetens it with an offer to give him aſſiſtance to recover <hi>Geneva,</hi> and reclaim that City from diſobedience to their Prince, and their Apoſtaſie from the Faith. This did not at all ſatisfie the wary and wiſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Duke, and ſo much the leſs for having towards the end of the paſt year diſcovered ſome practices of the Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own perſon, and came daily more and more to know, that the eldeſt Prince his Son had been tempted by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite the Succeſſion, though he that retained towards his Father an
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53750:39"/>
affection equal to veneration reſiſted all their ſuggeſtions. There was a Treaty in <hi>Zuccarello</hi> to deliver that place to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which came to be diſcovered, and the flight of the Colonel <hi>Allardi</hi> Provencal, who paſſed from the Service of the Duke to that of the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> confirmed it. He gives out that the <hi>Savoyards</hi> held Intelligence in ſeveral places of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Pavia.</hi> But the Duke denied every thing, bitterly complaining that <hi>Toledo</hi> ſhould lay Plots to intrap him, corrupted the Governors of his places, received his Rebels, and debauched his Souldiers.</p>
               <p>Preparations for War were now ſtrongly carried on, and the Agent of <hi>France</hi> being gone to <hi>Milan</hi> to endeavour means to bring the Treaty to effect, <hi>Toledo</hi> inveighing againſt the Duke, ſollicited <hi>France</hi> to force <hi>Carlo</hi> to lay down Arms, promiſing that when by the reſtitutions he ſhould have ſhewn the reſpect due, <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould leave nothing to be deſired from its juſt Greatneſs; declaring ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, that the preſent Arms tending to the relief of the Archduke, and to bring the <hi>Venetians</hi> to a Peace, were to be reputed out of this caſe, and the obligation of laying them down. But <hi>Carlo</hi> ſuſtained, that by the Treaty not only himſelf, but all <hi>Italy</hi> ought to be freed from the Jealouſie of his Arms, and offered the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whenſoever <hi>Toledo</hi> ſhould firſt diſarm. Theſe then were the ſteps to a new War in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and <hi>Carlo,</hi> informing the Princes, eſpecially thoſe which were Protectors of the Treaty of <hi>Aſti,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the oppoſition of the Governour, and with his own ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the common dangers. The Pope, to prevent the impendent miſchieves, appoints for Nuntio Extraordinary <hi>Aleſſandro Lodoviſio,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Bologna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> preſſes anew, that the Republick and the Duke would enter into the Northern League; but they, thinking it not an adequate remedy for the diſeaſes of <hi>Italy,</hi> King <hi>James</hi> applies himſelf to the ways of procuring Peace. For the ſame purpoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from <hi>France Monſieur de Bethune</hi> Ambaſſadour in <hi>Italy,</hi> and under-hand propoſes a Marriage betwixt <hi>Chriſtina</hi> the Kings Siſter, and <hi>Vittorio</hi> Prince of <hi>Piedmont:</hi> But <hi>Carlo</hi> receives it with a kind of diſtruſt, as if it aimed at diſarming and amuſing him. <hi>France,</hi> to ſay truth, was not now in a condition to give the Duke that aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Arms which he earneſtly required; for, <hi>d'Ancre</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all by private Counſellors, grounding himſelf upon the Marriages contracted with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the impreſſions he received from that Crown, had perſwaded the Queen to impriſon the Prince of <hi>Conde;</hi> upon which many withdrew from Court, complaining, that promiſes and treaties ſerved but to inſnare and make ridiculous the unwary. So that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had little more hope of aſſiſtance left than of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who by the Jealouſie they received from <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi> and for the Declarations of the King in favour of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, were very much perplexed.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſadour <hi>Scaglia</hi> then coming into the Senate, relates the ſeries of the former Negotiations, the endeavours of <hi>Carlo,</hi> the anſwers of the Governour, his actions, the deſigns juſtly giving Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53750:39"/>
to all, but to the Republick and the Duke chiefly miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, then adds: <hi>It is known how much</hi> Carlo, <hi>a generous and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Prince, in his conſent to the Peace, hath conſidered the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Princes Mediators, and particularly of this Republick, on whoſe word and warrant, and none other, he was willing to let his Arms fall out of his hand. And now I beſeech you, what is the ſtate of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs? Treaties, the juſt Rules of Friendſhip, are converted into the treacherous ſnares of intereſt. Heretofore we fought armed; but now under the fraudulent name of Peace we find our ſelves little better than without Arms, environed by a moſt powerful King, expoſed to dangers. It is uncertain how far the</hi> Spaniards <hi>will extend the greatneſs of their power and arbitrage. If enlarging Dominion be their deſign, no other mans ſtate is more ſecure than that of</hi> Piedmont. <hi>True it is, that my Prince ſtands the firſt expoſed, and although he be ſtrengthened with his own generoſity, and animated by the hopes of friends, yet he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as to the inviolable Sanctuary of Faith, to your aſſiſtances. He ſuppoſes them becauſe of the treaties, the promiſes, and your friendſhip; I may ſay, of your own intereſt: but let that be left to be weighed in the ſcales alone of your greateſt prudence. 'Tis certain, that common and greater troubles are at hand.</hi> Toledo <hi>either impoſes diſarming, or threatens War. Betwixt two great, and little leſs than equal, dangers, the Duke muſt either loſe himſelf in the one, or hazard himſelf in the other. Betwixt War and Servitude there is no middle ſecurity. But to loſe generouſly the State, is a courting of Fortune; to ſtand the ſhock of death, is to yield a little before-hand to the right of Nature; but to make himſelf a Slave, what will it be elſe but to ſubſcribe to the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reproaches of Fame, and to the contempt of Poſterity. Hitherto the Duke hath made reſiſtance: he hath done himſelf right, and repaid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</hi> Mendoza<hi>'s provocations have not gone ſcot-free; and now</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo <hi>would overcome him with treaties, promiſes, and threatnings. But</hi> Carlo <hi>ſupported by your conſtant friendſhip, will equally deſpiſe their flatteries and their frights. It properly belongs to your greatneſs and wiſdom to blunt the edge of that injury which is offered to the Word and Honour of Princes, and to reſiſt that pride, which thinks it ſelf of no authority, if not feared. Does</hi> Philip <hi>poſſibly forget the ſo many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms which he enjoys, largely ſcattered in all the parts of the world? Do not the States of</hi> Italy <hi>ſuffice, which heretofore made ſeveral Princes great? If</hi> Piedmont <hi>be not added to it, Monarchy, it ſeems they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, will fall to the ground, without glory, diſcredited and neglected. It is, O Fathers too true, that ambition hath placed the Centre, and from thence it ſeems they draw the circumference. The Conqueſt of</hi> Piedmont <hi>is but a ſtep of aſcent to the Monarchy of</hi> Europe; <hi>the States, the Treaſures, Liberty, Dignity this very Capital City, which is the repreſentative of the felicity and beauty of</hi> Italy, <hi>is deſtinated in their hopes to ſpoil, to fire, and to ſlavery. Now at length they thruſt themſelves into your rights, they aſſume the intereſts, they divert reſentments and juſt revenge, and under the ſpecious title of aſſiſting the weaker, they aim at nothing but eſtabliſhing Authority and Power. What more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains there in</hi> Italy <hi>free and beautiful, when the glory of this Republick,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53750:40"/>
and the generoſity of my Prince ſhall be laid low. Let thoſe dangers, and the foreboding of them be far from us. O Senators, let us joyn here, that we may not fear their threatnings, nor experience the loſs of our Arms; and if we ſhall be neceſſitated to make uſe of them, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will be gloriouſly crowned by our conſtancy.</hi> Carlo <hi>is diſpleaſed to be a burden before he can be of ſervice to you; but he has heretofore offered you all he hath, and now he makes a preſent of his very will to you. Direct his Arms by your counſels, who therein will be your faithful friend, and an inſeparable follower in this cauſe, in which not glory only, but common ſafety is in queſtion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Scaglia</hi> by this diſcourſe aimed to incite mens minds to thoſe two affections, which in Republicks, compoſed of many, are powerful enough; the one relating to private men, the other to Princes, that is, ſcorn and ſuſpicion. But <hi>Carlo</hi> at <hi>Turin</hi> to the Ambaſſadour <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio Donato</hi> uſed with great art incitements yet more moving; for diſcourſing things more narrowly with themſelves, and of the means of defence, he repreſented his ſtate, waſted with the late Wars, incapable to withſtand the burden for the time to come, leaving him to comprehend, that the Common-wealth not ſtepping in with effectual aſſiſtance, he ſhould be forced by neceſſity to ſome kind of agreement, though diſadvantagious, in which caſe the whole power of the Arms of <hi>Spain,</hi> beſides that of the Archdukes might fall upon them alone. The Senate being obliged to deliberate upon ſo weighty a matter, it was the opinion of ſome, that ſo many other Princes, equally Truſtees for the Peace of <hi>Asti,</hi> ſtanding Spectators, or at leaſt interpoſing nothing but deſires and endeavours, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick alone ought neither to eſpouſe ſo great a quarrel againſt ſo potent a King; Saying, <hi>That Wars were the Criſis, and moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſickneſs of States, ſubject to chance, to accidents, and the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the remedies themſelves. If the Republick found one War at preſent not a little burdenſom, why would they diſtract their thoughts and forces into two ſeveral parts? Have they poſſibly ſo much aſſurance of the Dukes faith, or ſo great proof of his conſtancy, that it is firmly to be believed, that one day either beaten or flattered, he will not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us? muſt the Army of</hi> Piedmont <hi>be maintained by the Treaſure of the Republick? But what Treaſury will be able ſufficiently to ſupply two ſuch devouring Gulphs? The beginning of a War was ready, and eaſie, the progreſs of it difficult, and the iſſue uncertain. In ſum, that Fortune makes ſport with Princes, and that of Princes thoſe prevail, who with the greateſt powers are able to weary the adverſity of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. That the Republick in times of greateſt ſtraight was wont to make uſe of the prudence of Councils before the noiſe of Arms, whilſt in affairs moſt difficult, time is the fitteſt and moſt wary Counſellor, which oftentimes gains that which Fortune cannot give. To the moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful what is the benefit of being Conquerours? And of the conquered, how many are the dangers and loſſes which they reckon?</hi> Their Judgment therefore was, not to paſs beyond the offices of a good amity with <hi>Carlo,</hi> and that in other Courts they ſhould imploy their exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53750:40"/>But <hi>Nicolo Contarini,</hi> a Senator of a warm ſpirit, abhorring ſuch ſlow opinions, ſpake in this manner: <hi>Whilſt we loſe the occaſion of the preſent Conjuncture, and thereby declare our opinions, that affairs for the future will go on proſperouſly without our mingling in them, we our ſelves by our own Counſels greaten the Enemy. We have ſo long neglected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, that now, being proceeded to violence, we ought no longer to ſuffer them, nor indeed can we. God preſents us an occaſion for our conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and withal gives us for a Companion in it a Prince generous in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſt. Can we poſſibly have a mind to expect the enjoyment of our liberty precariouſly at the will of the Governour of</hi> Milan? <hi>He vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates Faith and Treaties, forces</hi> Savoy <hi>to obedience, threatens our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; which to you is ſo much the more compulſive, or more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, by how much reaſon and juſtice, trod under foot by the more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, do not give their votes for the Princes. Shall free Princes then take up juſt Arms but at the good pleaſure of another; and muſt they expect no Peace but upon ſervile Conditions? Let the generoſity of</hi> Italy <hi>once awaken, and let us hear words worthy of Princes. But I would to God it were permitted at preſent to reſolve upon that which the Dignity, the Decorum, and Expediency requires, and that neceſſity interpoſed not with Counſels more reſolute and preciſe. Fathers, if we will not have the War in our bowels, we muſt reſolve to nouriſh and keep it afar off. Well is that Treaſure ſpent, and moſt happy thoſe cares, if they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from us the miſeries, the calamities, and the miſchiefs which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies bring with them. From</hi> Carlo <hi>what hoſtage of gratitude, and what pledge of faith can we have more ſincere, than the drawing the Enemy into his own Country? And if we will have him yet more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, how can the Duke abandon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, if he be abandoned of all? Amongst Princes there is no ſtronger tye, than that which adjuſts a conformity of Intereſts. They are the heart-veins, which meet in the liberty of the one, and the ſafety of the other. Both in a word are threatned and deſpiſed, and may at laſt be inſnared and oppreſſed. The aſſiſtance of the Republick is neceſſary for</hi> Carlo, <hi>and a diverſion by him is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Republick; if by Arms or Treaty we pretend to bring the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke to reaſon and quiet, we muſt give that fatal Remora of the Forces of</hi> Spain <hi>imployment elſewhere. I imagine, the charge will be objected; but for what imployment have our Anceſtors left us a rich Treaſure, but to be ſerviceable at need to maintain honour, and make good the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt unlooked for emergencies. Do you think our ſervitude will be leſs grievous, when we ſhall be bound with our unimployed Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and bound with the chains of our own gold? It is much better to fear, than make tryal of the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Forces; and if we fear them, let us diſpoſe of a defence far from us. The rule of juſt is of equal extent amongst Princes. If</hi> Philip <hi>give his moſt vigorous aſſiſtance to the Archduke; why ſhould we offend in giving ours to</hi> Carlo? <hi>To</hi> Carlo, <hi>with whom intereſt combines us, and faith given requires it. After the promiſe given, deliberation and counſel are no more in our own power. Let us look out Examples of old, and revolve the Memorials of freſher date, we ſhall not find, that the worm of a promiſe falſified hath ever corroded the integrity of publick faith: And that for this reaſon, becauſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53750:41"/>
this bond of things divine and humane cannot be looſned, but the order of the world will be confounded, and civil ſocieties left as a prey to opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, intereſts, and affections. If we will make our ſelves idle ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of others oppreſſions, we our ſelves ſhall deſerve to be abandoned by all in our dangers; and with what heart can we invoke God, much leſs our friends to our ſuccour, if obliged, and alſo required, we ſhould leave the Duke in prey to</hi> Toledo? <hi>Aſſiſtance is to be implored from Heaven it ſelf with the right hand held up to joyn endeavour to the vow, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Marriners, that have the Helm in their hand, and their eye on the Stars. God himſelf will aſſiſt our cauſe, becauſe this War, whether it be with Arms or Money, takes not counſel from ambition, but is the reſolution both of neceſſity and juſtice, in whoſe boſom the Common-wealth hath always found Peace or Victory. Let us couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly adventure to take the reſolution this day, becauſe though the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance ſhould prove difficult, certainly in the progreſs we ſhall meet with accidents of hopes, friendſhips, intereſts, and ſuccours that me think not of. I know, that in great affairs it is dangerous to diſcover ones opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, becauſe the Authors of reſolute Councils are like to thoſe that fling heavy ſtones into the air, not without danger of having them return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own heads, rather than hit the mark to which the hand dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it. I know alſo, that of good ſucceſs every body will be a ſharer, and that if it prove unproſperous, the blame ſhall be imputed to me alone; but if ſuch reſpects perſwade me to ſilence, the zeal for my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hath forced from me this diſcourſe.</hi>

               <p>The Senate was really inclined to comply with the Dukes inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, moved alſo from their own concerns; whereupon they reſolve to aſſiſt him, and though upon no particular Treaty, yet it was done under the bond of common Intereſt, ſo inviolable in the minds of Princes, that till the very end of the War the one wanted not money, nor was the other failing in his faith. They immediately conſent the levy of 4000 <hi>French</hi> under the Command of <hi>Monſieur de Chaſtiglion,</hi> at the charge of the Republick, that 2000 might ſerve the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the other paſs by Sea into <hi>Friuli;</hi> but in the concluſion they remained all in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> They diſburſe 50000 Ducats for another Levy, that the Marſhal <hi>Dediguieres</hi> offered of the ſame Nation; and to the end the Army in <hi>Piedmont</hi> might be kept vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and contented, they contribute, beſides other extraordinary aſſiſtances, 72000 Ducats a month. The Duke had a cloſe and particular confidence with <hi>Dediguieres,</hi> and he, little regarding the counſels of the Court, either corrupted by Strangers, or confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the private intereſts of the Favourite, did not only leave the paſſage of the Mountains open to the Souldiers, which in great numbers flocked to the readineſs of the pay; but was moved to go himſelf in perſon to <hi>Turin.</hi> 'Tis not to be doubted, but <hi>Carlo</hi> thinking to gain great reputation to his Forces and Counſels, drew him thither with the powerful attractive of gold: for the Mareſhal grown old in glory and the Wars, yielding eaſily to it, had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſlender beginnings equal reputation and wealth.

with the Mareſhal that ſhould make a noiſe, in the preſence not only of his own Sons and Miniſters, but of the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi>

Willing therefore to procure elſewhere a Levy of Strangers, they ſend to the united <hi>Switzers,</hi> to have 4000 men, and to the <hi>Griſons</hi> to obtain paſſage, <hi>Giovanni Baptiſta Padavino</hi> their Secretary, who formerly having concluded the League, expired a few years ſince, was very acceptable among that people, with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular applauſe of wiſdom and dexterity.

From <hi>France,</hi> the Court taking it, as if the Republick did not procure thoſe paſſages but for their own ſafety, and the indemnity of <hi>Italy,</hi> came order to <hi>Gheffier</hi> not to oppoſe it; but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ingaged in the <hi>French</hi> Factions, as Auxiliaries, were now grown to have almoſt the chief credit amongſt them, drawing to them the good will and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many. Their Miniſter thereupon circumventing the people, calling Councils, and ſowing Jealouſies, put them in mind of the miſchiefs, formerly by the like Treaties ſuffered by the Count of <hi>Fuentes;</hi> threatned anew to interdict Commerce, extolled the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of the vicinity, and of the quiet; and intermingling gifts with his proteſtations and promiſes, turned the people about as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, imprinting upon them hopes, fears, and jealouſies, paſſions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the ignorant vulgar. The multitude therefore preſuming themſelves neceſſary to all, fancied alſo every thing to be lawful; thoſe few, which adhered to the ancient friendſhips, and knew that the liberty of Government conſiſted in Juſtice rather than inſolence, could prevail nothing. Whereupon in a <hi>Pittach</hi> (for ſo they call the general Council of the three Leagues) congregated at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Miniſters, ſo far were they from granting the paſſage, that they diſpatched away Guards to the places lying fit to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53750:42"/>
hinder it, and recalled all thoſe that were already in ſervice of the Republick. The aforeſaid Miniſters then agree to leave the Country, leaving that popular paſſion to ſpend it ſelf, and till thoſe ſeditious Conferences ſhould be diſſolved.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> upon the conſent of a great Levy among Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Switzers,</hi> publiſhed that they would imploy it immediately againſt the <hi>Venetians;</hi> to whoſe Confines, having got knowledge of the concerts betwixt them and the Duke, they ſend a great many Forces. The Cardinal <hi>Borgia</hi> not long after in <hi>Rome</hi> endeavoured, though in vain, to ſtir them up againſt the Pope, requiring reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Spain</hi> of thoſe aſſiſtances, which in the beginning of his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate had been largely given by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> againſt the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick it ſelf. The Vice-King of <hi>Naples</hi> arming ſome Ships, profeſſed to give jealouſie to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> towards <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> and ſtop the <hi>Venetian</hi> Levies by Sea; and to ſpread their applications and forces into all parts, publiſhed beſides to infeſt the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> the part, whereof the Republick is above all others jealous. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick ſends to <hi>Corfu</hi> the Proveditor of the Fleet, that it might joyn in that Port after it had deſtroyed the Salt-pits of <hi>Trieſte;</hi> and as to the <hi>Terra ferma,</hi> the Confines were no ſooner fortified, but <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi> was quickly obliged to recal the Militia towards <hi>Piedmont,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Duke was in the field, in a condition rather to give than receive jealouſies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> now apply their mind more attentively on <hi>Friuli,</hi> and ſend to the Camp <hi>Ferrante de Roſſo</hi> and <hi>Franciſco Martinengo,</hi> the one General of the Ordnance, and the other of the Horſe; perſons advanced in years, and of tryed experience, to the end that with their help and counſel they might amend paſt miſcarriages. There went alſo the Prince <hi>d'Eſte</hi> as Governour General of the Gendarms; notwithſtanding that the Duke his Father, to pleaſe the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> had ſeverely forbid him; and becauſe the market-place in <hi>Venice,</hi> which in its diſcourſes hath its Arms ſo much the more ſharp as they are ſecret, inveighed againſt the Chiefs of the Army, with ſome ſort of ignominy, <hi>Anthonio Priuli,</hi> Cavalier and Procurator, was ſent Proveditor General of the Army with ſupreme Authority. And <hi>Barbarigo</hi> within a while after had leave to return home.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giovanni Battiſta Foſcarini</hi> and <hi>Franciſco Erizzo</hi> were added as Proveditors, to the end that they, with the General and the advice of the Chiefs of the Army, might determine upon the ſtate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; but all counſel being in vain without an increaſe of ſtrength, aſſembling with all ſpeed the moſt Troops they could, eſpecially of ſtrangers, they made haſte into the field. And to <hi>Traut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſtorf</hi> alſo in the opening of the new Campagnia arrived from <hi>Hungary</hi> 1000 Foot, and he with money from <hi>Spain</hi> levies a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 3000 more, beſides 500 Cuiraſſiers, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> under <hi>Baltazar Marradas</hi> ſent to aſſiſt <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Heightned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in courage with theſe and other aſſiſtances, he paſſes to this ſide of the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> and incamps at <hi>Lucinis,</hi> deſigning not only to cover <hi>Gradiſca,</hi> but to diſpute the poſſeſſion of the Campagne with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53750:42"/>
the <hi>Venetians.</hi> The deſign troubled them not a little, becauſe they became obliged to put themſelves under the Walls of <hi>Palma</hi> for the defence of their own Country; whereupon the buſineſs being put to debate, it was reſolved to try by all means to diſlodge him by force. The Army then ordered accordingly, the attaque by way of the Plain was aſſigned to <hi>Baglione</hi> with the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Corſi;</hi> that of the Hills, avoiding the ſteepy part of them, where was the Fort, to <hi>Camillo Treviſano</hi> Proveditor of the <hi>Croatian</hi> and <hi>Albaneſe</hi> Cavalry with the Strangers. <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> followed with the groſs to aſſiſt where occaſion ſhould lead him; and <hi>Barbarigo</hi> (not yet gone) was in the Army, aſſiſted by <hi>Roſſi</hi> and <hi>Martinengo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They began to march in the night, and <hi>Trautmanſtorf</hi> was found in his Quarter with 5000 Foot and 1500 Horſe, fortified with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and the vndervaluing of his Enemy, rather than with Guards or Ramparts. <hi>Baglione</hi> ſurpriſing ſome Sentinels, entred into the Quarter, poſſeſſing the Gate of a great Court-yard which ſerved for the entrance; but finding not the other, covered by the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and darkneſs, ſo readily as to advance further, the <hi>Germans</hi> had time to take the Alarm, and make it good. Conſtrained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to retire hence, he attacques in another part, and penetrates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certain Trenches; but the Enemy, being now every where in Arms, and the Cannon playing from the Fort, found every where a vigorous reſiſtance. <hi>Treviſano</hi> upon the Hills had poſſeſſed two Redoubts; but the enterpriſe not ſucceeding proſperouſly on the other ſide, <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> commands the Retreat after two hours fight; during which, with ſome few Souldiers, ſome Officers were ſlain on each ſide, and particularly of the <hi>Venetians, Lucio Richieri,</hi> whoſe death was lamented, and honoured by the Senate with teſtimonies of Honour to his Family. The aſſiſtants joyned again to the groſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Enemy with the ſound of Trumpets; but <hi>Trautmanſtorf,</hi> glad to have had the better by accident, and as it were ſleeping, came not forth, but applies himſelf to the better fortifying of his Quarter. After this there followed ſeveral Skirmiſhes and Incurſions on both ſides, but of little moment, the moſt conſiderable being that of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſano</hi> in the Canal of <hi>Ronzina,</hi> which lies in the utmoſt parts of <hi>Friuli</hi> faſt by the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> with the ſpoil of ſome Villages, and bringing away booty. <hi>Anthonino</hi> his Brother, a young man of great courage and extraordinary hopes, periſhed miſerably in <hi>Meriano,</hi> killed by a caſual ſtroke, whilſt the Souldiers in the idleneſs of the Quarter; being fallen to blows, he was haſtened to quiet them. But Summer coming on with exceſſive heat, ſickneſs increaſed in ſuch ſort in the Armies, that men and horſes dying, both ſides thought it beſt to keep themſelves for a time upon the defenſive only. Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of certain Forts was their only imployment, thoſe of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke raiſing one at <hi>Fara,</hi> which was called St. <hi>Pietro,</hi> and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> another at <hi>Foggiano,</hi> to cover the Territory of <hi>Montfalcon,</hi> and was called <hi>Priuli.</hi> To that which was beyond the <hi>Liſonzo, Trautmanſtorf</hi> oppoſes another a little upon the ſide, called the Star, and at <hi>Gradiſca</hi> cauſed to be made a Ravelin, which covered the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53750:43"/>
old Port. This laſt Fort vexed the <hi>Venetians,</hi> becauſe it might hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the deſign of laying a quarter upon the <hi>Carſo,</hi> at which they aimed, ſo ſoon as their Army ſhould be re-inforced; whereupon command was given to <hi>Franciſco Juſtiniano,</hi> with ſome Companies of <hi>Corſi,</hi> and to <hi>Baglione</hi> with others of the <hi>Albaneſe,</hi> to attempt the taking of it by Scalade; but were beaten off by thoſe within, and from the diſcovery of relief, which came behind them, perſwaded to retire. After this preparations go every where roundly on for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attempts.</p>
               <p>Where <hi>Friuli</hi> confines with <hi>Carinthia,</hi> falls in one of the principal Roads, which deſcends into <hi>Italy</hi> out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and there lies <hi>Ponteba</hi> a great Town, and of good trade; it is divided by a Bridge, the part on the other ſide is belonging to the Empire, and that on this to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Trade, by reaſon of common benefit, went ſecretly on under the tacit faith, and good correſpondence of the neighbourhood, and the rather, becauſe the Towns adjacent and <hi>Ponteba</hi> it ſelf were of the Juriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>Bamberg.</hi> Thoſe of the Archduke deſigned to make a ſudden irruption into <hi>Friuli</hi> from that ſide, hoping to ranſack many places in their way to <hi>Gemona,</hi> and perhaps get into the more open Country, and <hi>Traut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſtorf</hi> from the other ſide marching in thither, either make the Seat of the War upon the State of the Republick, or at leaſt with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vience and confuſion divide their defence and Army. The Biſhop being perſwaded to give his conſent, there came down from the Hills into <hi>Ponteba</hi> 400 of his Souldiers to ſtrengthen his Confines, and ſecond the deſign. <hi>Guglielmo Smit</hi> with 400 more of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> follows, and ſurpriſes the <hi>Venetian Ponteba</hi> with the Inhabitants bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in ſecurity and ſleep. Two Forts were preſently raiſed, one on this ſide the River kept by himſelf, and the other on the other ſide, which he put into the hands of thoſe of <hi>Bamberg.</hi> His intention was to go on further when he ſhould be re-inforced with more Troops, which he expected, but found, that the Peſants, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Venzone,</hi> poſſeſſing the tops of the Mountains, and fortifying the High-ways with ſome Works, threatned to oppoſe with Arms and Stones whoſoever ſhould dare to attempt the paſſage.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was the News hereof come to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Camp, but a ſudden remedy was judged neceſſary for an unexpected evil. And therefore the Proveditor <hi>Foſcarini</hi> haſtens thither with the Generals <hi>Martinengo,</hi> Count <hi>Nicholo Gualdo</hi> Governour of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dina,</hi> and <hi>Marco Antonio Manzano,</hi> commanding the Cavalry of the Country for that time. At <hi>Dogna</hi> upon the <hi>Fella,</hi> finding the Bridge broken, they got it mended, and the <hi>Germans</hi> making oppoſition, ſuch was the mettle of the <hi>Corſi</hi> and <hi>Albaneſe,</hi> that flinging themſelves into the water, and paſſing from Rock to Rock, they ſo diſabled <hi>Smiths</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that they were forced to retire in diſorder. The <hi>Venetians</hi> then purſuing the flight, entred mingled with them into the <hi>Ponteba</hi> of this ſide, and paſſing the Bridge, the Biſhops Souldiers giving way, they take the Imperial alſo. The <hi>Germans</hi> were almoſt all of them cut to pieces. The Plunder and Booty was great; neither
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53750:43"/>
did the reſentment of this ſurpriſe ſtop here, but invading the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> they pillaged <hi>Malborghetto</hi> of the <hi>Manzano.</hi> A little above <hi>Treviſa,</hi> a place ſomewhat bigger, and that making no reſiſtance, became the prey of the Souldiers. Terrour ſpreading it ſelf as a ſtone in the water which inforces one wave upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the City of <hi>Villaco</hi> was upon rendring; but the <hi>Venetians</hi> not willing to remove their Forces far from the center of the War, nor ingage them amongſt thoſe craggy Mountains, having fortified <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teba</hi> retired. At the ſame time <hi>Erizzo</hi> emulating his Colleague at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts <hi>Chiavoretto,</hi> where lay intrenched in a convenient Poſt 800 Foot of the Archdukes, and 150 Horſe. <hi>Livio Puppi,</hi> a man of credit amongſt thoſe of the Country, advancing before the reſt with a good number of thoſe who inhabiting the Mountains about <hi>Cividale</hi> are called Slaves, attacques the Trenches, ſeconded by <hi>Giovanni Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nengo</hi> with the Souldiers in pay. The Enemy were eaſily diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe the Horſe inſtead of helping them in thoſe narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, being not able to govern themſelves, trod them under foot, and brought them into confuſion; whereupon every one provides for his ſafety by a Retreat. The <hi>Albaneſe</hi> following the inſtinct of the Nation, fell preſently to pillage the place and the Quarter; which and their diſorder ſome of the Archdukes people perceiving, came down to fall into their Rere, and ſnatched away one Colours. But being preſently beaten back, left that place in the power of the <hi>Venetians</hi> who fortified it. <hi>Trautmanſtorf</hi> hereupon fearing, if the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould paſs the <hi>Liſonzo</hi> thereabouts, to be taken napping, abandoning the Quarter of <hi>Lucinis,</hi> goes to incamp himſelf in the Plain near <hi>Goritia.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> having gotten the chief end of their intentions, follow him a little way, but without doing him any hurt, and being aware of it too late inveſt <hi>Lucinis,</hi> and attacque the Fort there. It concerned <hi>Trautmanſtorf</hi> to preſerve it, and therefore entertaining the Beſiegers with frequent ſkirmiſhes, he brought into it, through by-paths, 200 Souldiers with ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; but all in vain, becauſe thoſe within having no more water reſolved ſilently to withdraw, and leave it. The <hi>Venetians</hi> entred into it, appointing for Governour the Count <hi>Alberto Pompei,</hi> and placed in the Town one of their principal Quarters. The Fort alſo of <hi>Fara</hi> being viewed by <hi>Baglione,</hi> who was there hurt with a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſhot, was immediately attacqued, and battered from a place of eminence, which for want of powder, Captain <hi>Sibit</hi> quickly rendred upon honourable conditions, there marching out 230 Souldiers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome hurt. In the heat of theſe good ſucceſſes <hi>Erizzo</hi> attempts <hi>Vipulzano,</hi> where being about 100 Souldiers in a great houſe, he bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it with three Cannons, and demoliſhing part of the wall forces it to render, to go out with their ſwords. <hi>Tolmino,</hi> which is a great Town on the other ſide the <hi>Liſonzo</hi> in the Mountains, was attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by the Count <hi>Gualdo</hi> with 500 of the Country Militia and ſome in pay; but the Caſtle diſcharging ſome Guns, the Peaſants that knew not to diſtinguiſh where there was danger, or ſafety, hearing the noiſe diſbanded, obliging the Count to retire but with a few.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:53750:44"/>The <hi>Venetians</hi> now increaſed both in ſtrength and courage, thought of paſſing the <hi>Liſonzo</hi> and marching towards <hi>Goritia;</hi> the Archdukes Army for want of pay being diminiſhed by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Run-aways: but the death of <hi>Pompeo Juſtiniano</hi> interrupts the deſign. He was marching in the Country towards <hi>Lucinis</hi> to view the ſituations and the paſſage of the River, when death ſeized him by a ſhot of a Muſquetton from the other ſide of the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> which ſtroke him in the reins, and brought him within a few hours after into the Quarter, where coming to extremity, he expired with the piety and conſtancy becoming every Chriſtian Souldier. His life, made famous in the Wars of <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he got the name of <hi>Bras de fer,</hi> becauſe having loſt his natural one, he made uſe of one of Iron, deſerved peradventure to have met with death in a more honourable occaſion. But in War chance ballances the events, not diſtinguiſhing, for the moſt part, in the laſt action, baſeneſs from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The Senate ſo much the more careful to adorn the memory of the dead, by how much the Common people were ready to blame his conduct when alive, acknowledged the ſervices he had done, by giving yearly penſions to his Mother and his Sons, and defraying his publick Funeral, cauſed a Monument to be erected for him in the Church of St. <hi>Giovanni</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> with an Equeſtrian Statue. In place of the dead was ſubſtituted with the title of Governour Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Armies <hi>Giovanni de Medici,</hi> natural Son of <hi>Coſmo</hi> the Firſt, Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who in the Wars of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> had acquired great fame. The Prince <hi>d'Eſte,</hi> to avoid any emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Medici,</hi> was ſent into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> whither alſo <hi>de Roſſi</hi> was transferred, to obſerve in thoſe parts the jealous proceedings of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army. Before this new General was arrived in <hi>Friuli,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> attempted to execute the deſign of <hi>Pompeo Juſtiniano</hi> to raiſe a Fort upon an height covered with Cheſnut-trees, on the other ſide being a Rivulet which runs betwixt the Hills of <hi>Lucinis,</hi> and from thence to batter the great Tower and the Bridge, which towards <hi>Goritia</hi> lies over the <hi>Liſonzo;</hi> but no ſooner came any Souldiers to ſeize that ſituation, but they of the Archdukes ſide apprehending the deſign, flocked thither in great numbers, and after long ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes obliged them to retire; and planted a Fort there called St. <hi>Boſco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> nevertheleſs, a little more backwards raiſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with ſome great pieces deſtroyed the Bridge, which was of great convenience to the Enemy; but <hi>Trautmanſtorf</hi> a little above laid another upon Rafts covered by a certain turning of the Chanel, and fortified it with ſome Trenches and Cannons upon the River it ſelf. The <hi>Venetians</hi> thereupon withdraw their Battery, become now of little profit, and in the Hills more diſtant from <hi>Lucinis</hi> made another Fort, called from the Family of the Proveditor, <hi>Erizzo,</hi> or from its figure the <hi>Star.</hi> After this, doubting leſt the Enemy ſtrengthened with many Companies under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> pay, and by <hi>Iſolani</hi> with ſome Troops out of <hi>Croatia,</hi> ſhould poſſeſs the Plain of <hi>Mainizza</hi> betwixt <hi>Lucinis</hi> and <hi>Fara,</hi> another Fort was laid there in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53750:44"/>
form of a ſquare, and of a more conſiderable circuit, to which the General <hi>Priuli</hi> gave his own name. So that all that Campagnia be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a circumference of Forts, and a defence of Redoubts and Trenches, diſperſing and imploying all that Souldiery, which united into a body might have been able to undertake ſome more generous adventure. The ſeaſon proper for the management of Arms being paſt in this manner, Excurſions were made on both ſides, with equal damage to certain Villages in the Mountains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> Count <hi>d' Ampierre, French</hi> by Nation, was no ſooner come into <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Camp with 500 <hi>Hungarian</hi> Foot, and 400 Horſe, but attempts to get himſelf reputation, by going out of <hi>Gradiſca</hi> and falling into the <hi>Venetian</hi> Quarters at <hi>Romans,</hi> where in a large cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit a few men were lodged: And it happened that he brake in upon them; but the Souldiers recovering their firſt diſorder, and putting themſelves in defence in a great houſe which ſtood in the midſt, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged them to retire. To repay them in the ſame coin, <hi>Camillo Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſano</hi> paſſed at noon-day the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> which in that ſeaſon was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhallow, and forces a Quarter of <hi>Walloons,</hi> who ſave themſelves by flight, he retiring in good order, upon the confluence of the Enemy from all parts thither. <hi>Trautmanſtorf,</hi> to reſent it with equal boldneſs, paſſes with all his Horſe to this ſide with more happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; for having driven in certain Guards advanced, he meets with <hi>Treviſano</hi> come out of <hi>Lucinis</hi> with few Companies of <hi>Capelletty</hi> on Horſe-back. Five Companies of Cuiraſſiers a little behind were to ſerve for their Retreat with ſome <hi>Corſi,</hi> placed in ambuſcade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Ditches and Hedges. But the heavy Horſe of <hi>Trautmanſtorf</hi> ſhocking the light ones of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> obliged them in the charge to ſuch diſorder, that in place of rallying behind the Squadrons of the Cuiraſſiers, they forced in upon them, and confuſed them in ſuch ſort, that they drew them to run with them. The <hi>Germans,</hi> purſued to the Trenches of <hi>Lucinis,</hi> by which and the Forts being repulſed, thought fit to retire; the Infantry remaining a prey to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who cutting off their way, they were either cut to pieces or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed; <hi>Franciſco Juſtiniano</hi> and <hi>Giovanni Domenico Ornano,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Corſi,</hi> being Priſoners. <hi>Foglia</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Captain was killed, and on the Archdukes ſide <hi>Trautmanſtorf, Marradas,</hi> and other chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were ſlightly hurt. <hi>Justiniano</hi> a while after was exchanged with Father <hi>Valerio</hi> a Jeſuit and <hi>Ferdinans</hi> Confeſſor, who, contrary to the orders of the Republick, paſſing through their Country in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed habit, came to be a Priſoner.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Istria</hi> came at the ſame time advice of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſucceſſes; for the General <hi>Zane</hi> diſ-imbarking at <hi>Scriſa,</hi> ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly by night plants his Cannon, with ſuch a fright to the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which conſiſted of <hi>Germans, Segnans,</hi> and ſome <hi>

his eſcape; but finding the paſſages ſtopped, enters the Town again, animating thoſe of his party, who deſpaired of pardon, to defend themſelves. The others intimidated with the threatnings of the General, that, if they delayed till the firſt Volly of his Cannon, he would give them no quarter, riſing up againſt <hi>Sarſich</hi> cut off his head, ſending it with the Keys of the Town to <hi>Zane,</hi> who received them at diſcretion, giving them all afterwards liberty and life, except the <hi>

               <p>All theſe ſucceſſes in both theſe Provinces of <hi>Friuli</hi> and <hi>Istria</hi> ſerved rather to entertain than decide the War: But in <hi>Piedmont</hi> the rupture broke out with greater noiſe; for <hi>Bethune,</hi> having with the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> uſed means and inſtances for Peace and for diſarming, had after twenty days received in anſwer, that the Duke having not ſincerely performed the diſbanding of his Militia, and having broken the Articles of <hi>Asti,</hi> neither did the King think himſelf obliged to them: Nevertheleſs declared, that when <hi>Carlo</hi> ſhould have effectually diſarmed and reſtored, he then would give his word not to offend him; but for the general diſarming, he would not conſent to it, by reaſon of the proceedings of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> rendred ſuſpect as well by the Invaſions made upon the Archduke, as for the ſuccours given to <hi>Carlo.</hi> He added a promiſe by word of mouth of a ſuſpenſion for a month, when the Duke ſhould give his word in the ſame manner to <hi>Bethune,</hi> not to offend the <hi>Milaneſe. Carlo</hi> conſents to it, perſwaded by <hi>Dedigueres;</hi> and induced with many reaſons, or rather forced by the Authority of the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters to forbear, if not provoked by Invaſions and Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; upon conditions nevertheleſs to retract his word, whenſoever the State of the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould be aſſaulted by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But the Governour, whoſe aim was by ſuch a Propoſition to make the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53750:45"/>
                  <hi>Venetians</hi> jealous by making them believe, that the Duke by little and little would be ingaged in other Treaties with other counſels, draws near to the Frontier of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> caſting ſeveral Bridges over the <hi>Seſia</hi> and <hi>Tanaro</hi> to facilitate his attacque in ſeveral parts, and give time for the ſpringing of a great Mine elſewhere, capable to bring the Dukes affairs to the laſt gaſp, if the Treacheries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, and the Forces now ready, might be able to proceed with equal ſteps.</p>
               <p>There was in <hi>France</hi> the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> a Branch of the Houſe of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and next to the ſucceſſion into thoſe States, if the Line of <hi>Carlo</hi> ſhould come to fail. He poſtpoſing certain private diſcords in being, about his appanage, ſhewed himſelf very earneſt in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the common Intereſts and Grandeur of the Family; and on that ſcore had promiſed <hi>Carlo</hi> a Levy of <hi>French</hi> to help to defend <hi>Piedmont.</hi> But having in his heart the motives of intereſt and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which more vigorouſly ſtirred him up to have a view afar off, of the ſucceſſion to thoſe States, hearkens to the inſinuations of the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who repreſented to him, that he might accel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate the hopes, rendred almoſt impoſſible by reaſon of <hi>Carlo</hi>'s nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous iſſue, if he would turn his Arms againſt his Kinſman, and conſpiring with <hi>Spain</hi> to his expulſion, reap as it were without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a moſt rich booty. <hi>Nemours</hi> no ſooner heard the offer, but he readily embraces it, conſenting to hold thoſe States in Fief of that Crown. Such a cozening blow could not ſucceed but by ſurpriſe and a carriage of great ſecrecy; he therefore continues to aſſemble his Levies with deep diſſimulation, making a ſhew to imploy them for <hi>Carlo</hi>'s aſſiſtance; but the concert was when he ſhould be entred into <hi>Savoy,</hi> where it was deſigned to give him his place of Arms ſuddenly, and with all his Force to march into the heart of the Country, and in the ſurpriſe and ſo great a confuſion poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all that which could not reſiſt; and at the ſame inſtant a great ſtrength raiſed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Burgundy</hi> were immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haſten to his ſuccours, while <hi>Toledo</hi> with the powerful Army of the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> ſhould make ſuch an impreſſion into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> that they ſhould not leave to <hi>Carlo,</hi> betrayed by his own, and at the ſame time aſſaulted by his enemies, any way of ſafety, nor hardly of eſcape. But he, always vigilant, having got knowledge, that money had been furniſhed by the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> to <hi>Nemours,</hi> came to diſcover the bottom of the ſecret, and orders the Marqueſs of <hi>Lants</hi> Governour of <hi>Savoy,</hi> that he ſhould have a careful eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Troops of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and receive them but in one place, and that far from any Town. It ſeemed, that <hi>Nemours</hi> was diſpleaſed at this diſtruſt, and at laſt doubting to be ſuſpected, ſends to the other ſide of the <hi>Rhoſne</hi> 1500 men; who ſeduced by the Officers, endeavoured to fortifie themſelves in <hi>Clermont,</hi> and another Town near-by. <hi>Lants</hi> immediately diſpatches, to drive them thence, ſome Troops, which ſent to <hi>Carlo</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Main,</hi> were paſſing through <hi>Savoy;</hi> whereupon the former, that did not willingly bear Arms againſt him, in whoſe name and under whoſe pay they had <pb n="80" facs="tcp:53750:46"/>
been raiſed, repaſs preſently the River, before <hi>Nemours,</hi> with other Forces, or any of the <hi>Burgundy</hi> Troops now upon the way, could arrive to ſtrengthen them. <hi>Toledo</hi> expecting that the deſign beyond the Mountains ſhould diſcover it ſelf, ſtays with his Army of 30000 men at <hi>Villatta</hi> and <hi>Candia,</hi> his chief Quarters. And the Duke lodges in the <hi>Vercelleſe</hi> at <hi>Careſana</hi> and <hi>la Motta,</hi> with his Army of 20000; Forces unequal, not only for the number, but for the eſteem and power which gave reputation to thoſe of <hi>Spain:</hi> whereas on the Dukes ſide there appeared ſcarce any thing conſiderable but his own courage and the conſtancy of his friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Toledo</hi> himſelf had a little after it had been given, retracted his word for a ſuſpenſion of Arms, diſpleaſed that the Duke ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to himſelf a power to aſſiſt the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and although <hi>Bethune</hi> took the trouble to go to <hi>Pavia</hi> to propoſe one more general, which might comprehend the <hi>Venetians</hi> alſo, he found oppoſition, and the Governour was heard to declare himſelf, that as things ſtood, he had no power but to aſſiſt <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> And ſo the War hereupon breaks forth into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> receiving its firſt motion from 200 <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Horſe, which on the other ſide of the <hi>Seſia</hi> over-run the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try towards <hi>Stroppiana</hi> for booty. The Duke believing them more in number, went to meet with them, and obliged them to retire. He afterward attempts to burn the Bridge, which <hi>Toledo</hi> had over the <hi>Seſia;</hi> but the Fire-boats, ſtopt by certain impediments laid longſt the ſhores, had no effect. He then enters into <hi>Monferrat,</hi> plunders certain Villages, takes <hi>Villa nova,</hi> and caſting a Bridge over the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> threatens to paſs into the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi> The Governour ſends 6000 men to recover <hi>Villa nova,</hi> in the defence of which the <hi>Savoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> not willing to ingage themſelves burnt it; and thereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a notable Skirmiſh in the open field, where were killed on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſide, together with 200 Souldiers, the Son of the Prince of <hi>Aſcoli,</hi> and <hi>Lodovico Gambaloita</hi> Colonel of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> an experienced and valiant Commander. The Governour aiming to incloſe the Duke, ſends towards <hi>Gattinara</hi> a body of his Army, and with the reſt takes his march towards <hi>Creſcentino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo</hi> was firſt poſted in <hi>Sigliano,</hi> which is a place environed by mooriſh grounds and waters, with one ſole avenue, and very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune to ſuccour <hi>Vercelli,</hi> if the Governour ſhould attacque it. Seeing afterwards the Enemies motion towards <hi>Creſcentino,</hi> taking with him his Cavalry, and 2000 Muſquetiers behind them, paſſes in ſight of them, and coming firſt he provides, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves that place. Threatning as he paſſed to fire <hi>Livorno,</hi> a great Town of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> he receives Hoſtages with promiſe of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Several Skirmiſhes happened; in one of which <hi>Franciſco Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</hi> Son of the Ambaſſadour in <hi>Genoua,</hi> commanding 100 Horſe, fell into the hands of the <hi>Savoyards.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> fruſtrated in their firſt deſign vented their malice with burning the Villages of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and <hi>Carlo,</hi> of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> to be even with him, either out of hatred to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> or becauſe willing to proceed with a certain reſpect towards the <hi>Milaneſe. Alphonſo d' Avalos</hi> was
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53750:46"/>
Governour of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> born in <hi>Italy,</hi> but by extraction and no leſs in affection <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> who having ſeveral times provoked a rupture, experiences now the equal burden of the Arms both of his friends and of his enemies. He aſſembles a certain number of the Country-Militia; but <hi>Carlo</hi> fearing leſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſons ſhould practiſe to get themſelves into thoſe places, which ſhould make themſelves moſt troubleſom to them, cauſed the Prince Cardinal <hi>Mauritio</hi> to take, as he did with little oppoſition, and demoliſh <hi>Vulpiano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Autumn was now come, and with ſo much rain, that the Rivers overflowed on all ſides. The chief bodies of the Armies were therefore conſtrained to halt for ſome days, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Livorno</hi> and <hi>Bianze,</hi> and in <hi>Creſcentino</hi> the <hi>Savoyard.</hi> The waters at laſt making place, <hi>Toledo,</hi> who aimed at <hi>Vercelli,</hi> commands <hi>Madruccio</hi> with the <hi>Germans</hi> to lodge at St. <hi>Ja,</hi> and he with the reſt goes to St. <hi>Germano,</hi> eight miles diſtant from <hi>Vercelli,</hi> a place, though not exquiſitely fortified, that had nevertheleſs a good Rampart, and a Ravellin without. The Signor <hi>di Cro</hi> was Governour, with 500 Foot <hi>Savoyards,</hi> and 300 of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> but ſcarce had the <hi>Spaniards</hi> plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted five pieces of Cannon in Battery, but he, firſt overcome either by fear or infidelity, renders himſelf, ſaving the plundering to the Town, and to the Souldiers their Arms. <hi>Carlo</hi> was on the way to relieve it, when underſtanding the loſs, inraged with grief and anger he retired, and inveighing bitterly againſt the baſeneſs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, cauſed him to be arreſted, and his head taken off; vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fury afterwards upon <hi>Monferrat, Bianze,</hi> which made reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt his Vantguard experienced the utmoſt of rigour, and many Towns and Villages yielded to the fire, ſword, ſpoil, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions. <hi>Piedmont</hi> in the mean time was no leſs afflicted with ſword and burning, in that part eſpecially ſituate betwixt the <hi>Seſia</hi> and the <hi>Dora,</hi> though the Duke to reſtrain excurſions had laid two Forts in places convenient for it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Toledo,</hi> having his aim ſtill upon <hi>Vercelli,</hi> feigns his march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Creſcentino,</hi> when the Duke ſtill marching in his flank endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prevent him. Each Army aſpired to anticipate his Enemy, and be firſt in the Plain called <hi>Apertole,</hi> where they might conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently range themſelves, and either give or receive battel. The Duke haſtened to paſs, being the more earneſt in it, becauſe <hi>Toledo</hi> made as if he would amuſe and hinder him, and therefore brings the beſt of his Forces into the Vantguard, in hope to come to blows. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> feigning to attacque him in Front, charged with 10000 Foot and 2000 Horſe his Rear, which conſiſted of 4000 <hi>French,</hi> and ſome few Horſe, and in the filing through a Wood was diſordered; ſo that he was now put to fight with his Enemy, with the ſituation, and with his own diſorder; and although the Count of St. <hi>Giorgio</hi> with 500 commanded Muſquetiers arrived to their relief, yet it was ſo late, that it ſerved only to put the Enemy to a ſtand for a while, till night coming on the fight ended, and the <hi>French</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the groſs of the Army. Though the number of the dead on the Dukes ſide exceeded not 200 Foot and 50 Horſe, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:53750:47"/>
with reaſon aſcribed to themſelves the Victory, becauſe they remained maſters of the field and of much baggage.</p>
               <p>The Duke had the contentment to ſee the <hi>French</hi> blooded, hoping that the ancient hatred and emulation betwixt theſe Nations being once awakened, they would repair their loſſes, and bring no ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to himſelf. He retires to <hi>Creſcentino,</hi> and the Governour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to <hi>Lucedio</hi> from whence he was come; paſſes afterwards to <hi>Vena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> to begirt <hi>Vercelli</hi> from far, and orders the <hi>Germans</hi> to take in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizzolo,</hi> which lying on the way of <hi>Invrea,</hi> excluded all ſuccours from that ſide. Nevertheleſs <hi>Carlo</hi> had brought them in before; ſo that under the Marqueſs <hi>di Caluſo,</hi> who by flight had ſaved himſelf out of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands, there was 5000 effectual Foot and 250 Horſe, ſtrengthening the place in ſuch ſort, that <hi>Toledo</hi> judged the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe for that year too late and unſeaſonable, and contents himſelf to poſſeſs thoſe Poſts only, which in the next Campagnia might beſt ſerve for his purpoſe. To keep the Forces of the <hi>Savoyards</hi> ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into ſeveral parts, <hi>Mortara</hi> the Governour of <hi>Aleſſandria</hi> taking the field with few leſs than 5000 Foot and Horſe, for the moſt part of the Militia of the Country, takes in <hi>Canelli,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Corte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miglia.</hi> The Duke preſently orders the Prince Cardinal to oppoſe him, joyning 3000 Souldiers of the Country Militia to 1000 <hi>French.</hi> Three hundred of the <hi>Monferrins</hi> lodging in St. <hi>Sebaſtiano</hi> upon the <hi>Po,</hi> ſhut up the River, and infeſted the parts thereabouts. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred of the <hi>Savoyards</hi> attaque this Port, and with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ado cutting to pieces the defenders, raze it to the ground. St. <hi>Giorgio</hi> attempted St. <hi>Damiano,</hi> but was repulſed, and <hi>Mortara</hi> at <hi>Ceſtiola</hi> had no better ſucceſs. Thus betwixt the parties paſſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral factions and ambuſcadoes, wherein Fortune gave little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to either.</p>
               <p>But beyond the Mountains <hi>Nemours</hi> having got together about 7000 men, gave not only jealouſie to the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> but ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions alſo to the neighbouring Provinces of <hi>France;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Monſieur d' Allingcourt,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> and <hi>Dediguieres,</hi> who governed the <hi>Liſonzo, Burgundy,</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> having a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Lyons</hi> (where alſo was Prince <hi>Thomaſo,</hi> whom the Duke his Father had ſent with a good ſtrength into <hi>Savoy</hi>) and falling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the inteſtine troubles of the Kingdom, and the artifices of Strangers that might under this Army either be fomented or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, they reſolved to deny him paſſage, and by all fair means to perſwade him to Peace. It behoved him therefore to reſtrain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within that narrow corner, which ſerved the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of their Troops into <hi>Flanders.</hi> Being repulſed at the Bridge of <hi>Greſſin,</hi> which he attempted to paſs, he was there abandoned by the <hi>French,</hi> who in a body marched away with flying Colours. He was no ſooner got back with the Troops of <hi>Spain</hi> into the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> but he lends his ear to an accord; and though he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſome place in Soveraignty, and to keep a Garriſon in <hi>Nixi,</hi> as it were for his Appennage, nevertheleſs he was contented that 50 <hi>Switzers</hi> ſhould be left there for a year, and 50000 Crowns, beſide
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53750:47"/>
ſome hopes of having one of <hi>Carlo</hi>'s Daughters for his Wife.</p>
               <p>The prize and prey of fraud being come to nought, <hi>Toledo,</hi> to prepare for ſome enterpriſe worthy of himſelf and of his Forces, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſo much the more to ſtraighten <hi>Vercelli,</hi> cauſing <hi>dal Luna</hi> to poſſeſs <hi>Gatinara,</hi> which ſtopped another paſſage over the River to the Town it ſelf. All this while Treaties of Peace ceaſed not; the ſeaſon now become very ſharp, giving opportunity for it. For that purpoſe <hi>Lodoviſio</hi> already aſſumed into a Cardinalſhip, and <hi>Bethune,</hi> conferred with the Governour in <hi>Trin,</hi> and with the Duke in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſo,</hi> and finding in both an equal peeviſhneſs and punctuality not to be willing to offer Propoſitions; they offered a rough draught containing, <hi>That the Duke for the firſt ſtep, licenſing the</hi> French, <hi>the Governour ſhould then retire out of</hi> Piedmont, <hi>and quit the places poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed during this War. That he ſhould then alſo diſcharge the</hi> Switzers <hi>and</hi> Germans <hi>with a part of the Horſe, and ſhould promiſe not to moleſt the</hi> Venetians. <hi>That</hi> Savoy <hi>ſhould then quit all that had been taken in this War, and that</hi> Toledo <hi>ſhould at laſt do the ſame.</hi> The Duke made no difficulty to give his aſſent, becauſe the conditions were ſeemly, and preſerved common ſafety. But the Governour of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> denies them upon the wonted pretext, to have no power to meddle in the affairs of the <hi>Venetians</hi> otherwiſe than by Arms. As for <hi>Savoy,</hi> he promiſed nothing more but his word to the Pope and to <hi>France</hi> not to offend him, and to reſtore what he poſſeſſed when the Duke with an effectual diſarming ſhould ſhew an inclination to Peace, refer to the Judgment of the Emperour the differences with the Houſe of <hi>Gonzage,</hi> and render the places taken. But <hi>Carlo</hi> not obſerving in theſe conditions any footſtep of the Treaty of <hi>Asti,</hi> ſaw <hi>Italy</hi> and himſelf involved in greater ſuſpicions, and the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> in more conſiderable dangers. And therefore to the faith of the promiſes agreed on, and the gratitude of the ſuccours received, he added this conſideration; That the Governour aiming to break this Union, the better to oppreſs all, he could expect no other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it, but to be the laſt ſhould periſh in the common deluge. For this cauſe, although the Mediators did <hi>de novo</hi> ſpeak with him, and alſo with the Governour, diſcourſing of modifications and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, and that the Governour inſinuated to him particular advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, if ſeparating from the Republick he would make a private accord, he conſtantly reſiſted all their Propoſitions. In this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement <hi>Bethune</hi> encountred the Dukes kind acceptance and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, and <hi>Lodoviſio</hi> that of <hi>Spain,</hi> it ſeeming that he now deſigned to lodge in that Monarchy the hopes, which together with their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit many of the Cardinals uſe to put on. The Treaty being now at an end, <hi>Bethune</hi> would have repaſſed the <hi>Alps,</hi> if the <hi>Venetians</hi> had not prevailed with him to ſtay for the order and grace of the Treaty. Peace then deſpaired of, all parties arm with great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and the Governour making great Levies every where, keeps his Army in great vigour. <hi>Carlo</hi> ſtrengthens himſelf with 6000 Foot and 700 Horſe, which after the accord with <hi>Nemours</hi> being of no uſe in <hi>Savoy,</hi> he cauſes to deſcend into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and <hi>Dediguieres</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:53750:48"/>
not regarding the threatnings and proteſts of the Count of <hi>France,</hi> ſends him 4000 Foot and 600 Horſe, raiſed under the <hi>Venetian</hi> Pay.</p>
               <p>The courage of the Duke and the gold of the Republick drew Souldiers in great number, and <hi>Erneſto</hi> Count of <hi>Mansfelt</hi> arriving, in the name of the Proteſtant Princes of the Empire, at <hi>Turin,</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as many as they needed. The <hi>Venetians</hi> finding the difficulty great to get ſupplies through the ſtraights of the paſſages of the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> reſolved to make uſe of the Sea, although with greater charge, agreeing with the Count <hi>Leveſtein</hi> for the Levy of 3000 <hi>Walloons</hi> and of as many <hi>Hollanders</hi> under Count <hi>John Erneſt</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw.</hi> The Winter was ſpent in giving orders, and making proviſions, yet not wholly without ſome intermixture of enterpriſes of War; for <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the better to redreſs by his preſence the affairs of his States, being come to <hi>Caſale, Carlo</hi> reſolved now to do him a publick affront, cauſing ſeveral of his Towns to be plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under his noſe, and <hi>Moncucco</hi> to be aſſaulted, which by its vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was very troubleſom to <hi>Chieri.</hi> Though <hi>Ferdinand</hi> deſired to bring ſuccours into it, yet the <hi>Savoyards</hi> Cannon not giving time, the place was preſently buried in its own ruines, and the Governour coming forth without Arms, the <hi>Germans</hi> that were of the Garriſon being cut to pieces, the <hi>Monferrins</hi> had their lives given them. Theſe attempted a revenge upon <hi>Paſſerano,</hi> aſſiſted by ſome of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe; but being repulſed by the Peaſants alone, left dead upon the place the Cavalier <hi>Rivara,</hi> Governour of <hi>Trino,</hi> with the reputation of a gallant Souldier. On the other ſide the Signor <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riea</hi> with ſome few <hi>French,</hi> recovered by Scalada <hi>Salizuola,</hi> not well guarded by the <hi>Germans.

               <p>But <hi>Carlo,</hi> with good Spies having his eyes and ears every where, came to the knowledge of it, and carefully ſending Prince <hi>Thomaſo</hi> to change the Garriſon he brake the deſign.

To diſpatch it quickly, the Prince had a mind to take it by Aſſault; but the <hi>French</hi> Officers thinking it a hazard of too great difficulty, he would not ingage himſelf in it, but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about to <hi>Maſſerano.</hi> This is a little Principality on the other ſide the <hi>Seſia,</hi> where for the more ſtrengthening the <hi>Vercelli</hi> on that ſide, <hi>Toledo</hi> deſigned to place a Garriſon; but whilſt ratifications were expected from <hi>Spain,</hi> concerning the recompences with which that Prince was to be contented, <hi>Vittorio</hi> breaks the Treaty with his Sword. The Princeſs, who alone with her Sons was within it,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53750:48"/>
from fear was eaſily perſwaded to ſurrender. At <hi>Creveceur,</hi> a place appertaining to the ſame, the diſpute was ſomething harder, becauſe <hi>Luna</hi> haſted from <hi>Milan</hi> with ſuccours; but <hi>Vittorio</hi> going to meet him, beats him, leaving <hi>Luna</hi> himſelf with many of his dead upon the place. The place then renders of its own accord; and becauſe it is a Fief of the Church, juſtly excuſed to the Pope the force, whilſt that Prince ſo perniciouſly conſpired againſt <hi>Piedmont. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſo,</hi> Governour of <hi>Vercelli,</hi> drives the Enemy out of <hi>Deſana;</hi> but factions and further progreſs ended with the year, the Prince alſo falling into a dangerous ſickneſs. The <hi>Venetians</hi> were not well pleaſed to hear, that <hi>Carlo</hi> ſparing the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> which did offend him, ſhould trouble the <hi>Monferrat,</hi> which was innocent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore attempted to ſet on foot a Compoſure betwixt the two Dukes, and that in order to ſome kind of reconciliation of their minds, they ſhould ſpeak together; but 'twas in vain, becauſe <hi>Ferdinand</hi> required, that as a Preludium to the future friendſhip, the <hi>Savoyards</hi> ſhould have regard to his State; and <hi>Carlo,</hi> who found not the <hi>French</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enter into the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> by reaſon of the intereſts of that Crown, alledged for excuſe, that with invading it, he ſhould have re-inforced <hi>Toledo</hi> with thoſe aſſiſtances, which ſome of the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> are in that caſe obliged to give. He continues therefore in his inſults and damages done to the <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and ſo much the more by how much the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> having a little before married <hi>Katherine</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Medici,</hi> and thereby the former project of Marriages being fallen to the ground, he had now no other remedy for his pretenſions, but to do himſelf reaſon with his Sword; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in the places taken, and particularly in the <hi>Canaveſe,</hi> he exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an oath from the people as their lawful Prince.</p>

            <p>MANY believed, that King <hi>Philip</hi> being of an upright mind, and a moſt impartial underſtanding, and the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> both by Genius and Intereſt inclined to Peace, that which followed in <hi>Italy</hi> was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, rather than contrived in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that it had its riſe from that <hi>Triumvirat,</hi> which <hi>Pietro Girone,</hi> Duke <hi>d'Oſſuna</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Naples, Toledo</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> and <hi>la Queva</hi> Ambaſſadour in <hi>Venice</hi> formed; who in their vaſt thoughts endeavouring to baniſh Peace and oppreſs <hi>Italy,</hi> had their aim not ſo much to make themſelves famous, as the imployment neceſſary to the King, and of advantage to themſelves. It was therefore judged, that the Councils of <hi>Madrid,</hi> ingaged upon their relations in a point of honour and reputation, in which the Nation is beyond meaſure tenacious, did prefer this ſole conſideration before ſo many others, which rendred the preſent actings prejudicial to the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; becauſe in ſome Princes hatred ſpringing up, in others jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies being awakened, it ſeemed that all were afraid, and nothing was thought ſecure from the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> or ſufficient for their avarice.</p>
            <p>To inform themſelves then of the mind of the King and of the Favourite, the <hi>Venetians</hi> give command to <hi>Pietro Gritti</hi> their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, a Miniſter of a ſo well tempered prudence, that flegm was not predominant, nor did it yield to the ſagacity of that Court,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53750:49"/>
no leſs conſiderate than circumſpect, to repreſent the preſent ſtate of affairs; <hi>Putting them in mind of the ancient correſpondencies ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely practiſed with that Crown for the reſtraint of the</hi> Turks, <hi>the Peace of</hi> Italy, <hi>and the good of Chriſtendom, aſſuring them alſo, that the Republick retained the ſame lively motives of eſteem and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that Crown, united to the deſigns and intentions of a free and honourable Peace. They declare withal, that having taken Arms to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves againſt the untolerable outrages of the</hi> Uſcocchi, <hi>they pretended nothing of the Archduke but the execution of things promiſed. That</hi> Carlo <hi>had nothing to require of the Governour of</hi> Milan <hi>but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of things already agreed. To what purpoſe then ſhould</hi> Italy <hi>be ſcourged with Armies, and tortured with Jealouſies, if under the ſhadow of mutual faith, which is the moſt precious Crown of Princes, all things might be quieted?</hi> The Ambaſſadour added other conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions which might manifeſt, the Republick inclined to Peace, but reſolved not to abandon their own decorum or their friends. In <hi>Spain</hi> the Miniſters had various reflections thereupon. It ſeemed to ſome, that the arbitrement, which they affected in the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> being rather called into doubt than maintained, it was fit to re-eſtabliſh it with ſome advantage before to admit of a Treaty. Others apprehending, through the univerſal diſguſt of the Princes, greater commotions and accidents, which time did afterwards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce greater indeed than could have been believed, were of opinion to embrace conditions of compoſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lerma,</hi> to make himſelf Arbiter of the War and of the Peace, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, that a Treaty ſhould be ſet on foot, but that it was to be tranſacted in <hi>Spain,</hi> doubting leſt the Emperour, reſolved that the affairs of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> ſhould be compoſed, if the management of the Peace ſhould be in his Court, he ſhould conſtrain the Archduke to accept it; in which caſe the <hi>Venetians,</hi> free from a diverſion on that ſide, mihgt be able to revenge themſelves upon the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> for thoſe jealouſies which the Governour had endeavoured to bring upon them. It was therefore anſwered to the Ambaſſadour in the moſt lively expreſſions, that the mind of the King, always conformable to piety and juſtice, was poſſeſſed with equal motives of inclination to Peace with the Republick and with the Duke; whereupon it was reſolved in <hi>Venice</hi> and in <hi>Turin</hi> to diſpatch to <hi>Gritti</hi> powers to treat and conclude a Peace.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> did highly reſent it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that competition of Authority, which, in affairs of weight, Princes, though friends, aſcribe to themſelves; prejudging unhappy ſucceſs to the buſineſs, if, placed in the ſelf-will of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> their authority were not qualified by the power of ſome other Crown, which might be able to facilitate the Negotiation, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily inſpect the concluſion. But although the deſigns and ends of the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> were not unknown, <hi>Carlo</hi> nevertheleſs thought to have much advantaged himſelf, by having brought the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to treat with him as an equal; and the Republick hoped that the King thus intereſſed in the mediation of Peace, the minds of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53750:50"/>
Miniſters of <hi>Italy</hi> would prove leſs hoſtile and troubleſom. That Court being more given to delay than conclude, all things began and proceeded very ſlowly; but the War was ſpeeded in <hi>Friuli</hi> with ſo much the more diligence, though in <hi>Piedmont</hi> with greater ſucceſs. In <hi>Iſtria</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> happened to take <hi>Zemino,</hi> a place ſtrong and of importance. The Town was eaſily taken, being abandoned by the Garriſon; but the Caſtle was forced by three Batteries, there marching out 300 <hi>Germans</hi> and ſome of the Country Militia. In <hi>Friuli, Anthonio Lando</hi> Procurator, ſucceeding in the Generalat to <hi>Priuli,</hi> there being arrived at the Camp a Renfort of good Troops, all diligence was uſed to ſtraighten <hi>Gradiſca</hi> in earneſt.</p>
            <p>It happened, that as the Count <hi>d'Ognate,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> paſſed through thoſe parts, to receive him with the accuſtomed honour of the Militia there was a ſuſpenſion from action for a little while; and the <hi>Venetians</hi> in that interim to honour him by meeting him with their Army, covering with ſome Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons of Cavalry a certain houſe, which ſtood betwixt <hi>Meriano</hi> and <hi>Fara,</hi> very near to <hi>Gradiſca,</hi> caſt up earth about it, and, before the Enemy were aware of it, raiſed a Fort in defence, which was afterwards called the Fort of the Compagnia, and was the beginning of the circumvallation of the place.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Medici</hi> deſiring to ſtop up all the ways of ſuccours, orders the taking in of St. <hi>Martino di Cuſca,</hi> and ſends thither by night from <hi>Vipulzano</hi> and other Poſts Souldiers with neceſſary proviſions. The Garriſon had been ſurpriſed in their negligence and ſleep, if an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident had not procured their eſcape; for in a very narrow Lane the Horſe, which carried the Pettard, taking fright from a certain ruſtling noiſe, ſet a running, with the ſhock of ſome, by whoſe Arms in the wonted reſonancy of the mountains the noiſe being augmented, thoſe that were behind, frightned with the confuſion of them that were before, not knowing what the danger was, and therefore thinking it greater, betook themſelves alſo to flight. The command of the Officers increaſed the diſorder, who calling to the Fugitives to make a ſtand, it was believed of thoſe afar off, that they meant they ſhould rather double their ſteps in their flight. But being come to a Village, and ſome gathering together there, the light clearing up by the breaking of the day, they ſaw nought but the image of their own ſhame. Nevertheleſs in conſequence of the noiſe the Enemy being alarmed, haſtened from ſeveral Poſts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and <hi>d'Ampierre</hi> cauſing four Companies to advance, orders them to aſſault the Village; but the <hi>Venetians</hi> being found covered with ſome earth haſtily flung up, one Company was defeated, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left its Cornet there. Whereupon the reſt of the Archducari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans having made a halt, the <hi>Venetians</hi> had opportunity to retire to their Quarter, quitting the thoughts of attacquing the Caſtle, into which ſuccours were now entred. But to exclude the <hi>Germans</hi> from all acceſs of coming on this ſide the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> there was another Fort laid betwixt that of <hi>Lucinis</hi> and <hi>Priuli</hi> with two Cannons on it, which beat upon the ſhores of the River.</p>

He was afterwards ſent into <hi>Iſtria,</hi> where after the Surrender of <hi>Zemino,</hi> the people were waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the more, becauſe the Town of <hi>Gallignano</hi> was ready to be loſt, inveſted by <hi>Anthonio Barbaro,</hi> returned General into that Province. <hi>Marradas</hi> brought ſuccours into it, plundered here and there the Country, and coming to <hi>Fionova</hi> burnt certain Veſſels in the Port. Beſides theſe, the actions on that ſide were of no great moment.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Friuli, Lando</hi> was reſolved to climb the <hi>Carſo,</hi> it having ſeemed fatal, becauſe there was the open Sea, if till now any one had attempted the paſſage betwixt the Mountains. The Enemy themſelves diſcovered this deceit, becauſe ſome had made a doubt, that for want of earth, there was no lodging with neceſſary defence upon thoſe Rocks; but now it was ſeen, that they apprehending that which was the <hi>Venetians</hi> very thought, raiſed a Fort upon thoſe very Hills, which was called <hi>Diana,</hi> taking its name from ſome Ladies, who to haſten the work did labour about it. This did not only not divert, but promoted the intention of <hi>Lando,</hi> who planting a Fort with his own name at <hi>Bruma,</hi> which with two others reached to the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> cloſed on the under-ſide the circumvallation to <hi>Gradiſca,</hi> whilſt on the upper ſide the Fort of the Campagnia, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with good intrenchment to <hi>Fara</hi> and <hi>Meriano,</hi> fully ſtopped every paſſage. <hi>Trautmanſtorf</hi> made a great Sally, chiefly to view theſe new works: but being beaten back by the <hi>Corſi,</hi> who had the guard of the Fort <hi>Lando,</hi> and the Commander <hi>Colredo,</hi> who was there with him, receiving a Muſket-ſhot, he retired, ordering a half-moon to cover the place on that ſide.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> nevertheleſs deferred for ſome days to paſs the <hi>Liſonzo</hi> thereabouts, becauſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> under <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbarking at <hi>Monfalcon</hi> were to take thoſe Poſts, were not yet ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and therefore they had thoughts to attempt it on the upper ſide in the Chanel of <hi>Ronzina. Medici,</hi> to diſtract the Enemies Forces, orders the attacque of ſeveral Poſts: Sends <hi>Contino Mamoli,</hi> Colonel of <hi>Greeks,</hi> to take in a houſe near to <hi>Gradiſca,</hi> where pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſome Cannon, it occaſioned ſome fright within the Town. Count <hi>Nicholo Gualdo</hi> took St. <hi>Floriano</hi> in the Mountains, abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after a ſhort defence by the Garriſon. But <hi>Coſmo de Monti,</hi> who with a Pettard was to attempt the Fort <hi>Diana,</hi> and the <hi>Corſi,</hi> who had the charge committed to them to take in that of <hi>Boſco</hi> by Scalade, were both repulſed. <hi>Medici</hi> was in the Plain of <hi>Mainizza,</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:53750:51"/>
to the end that under the favour of a battery the Horſe might paſs to the other ſide of the River, and <hi>Treviſano</hi> with Count <hi>Ferdinand Scotto</hi> performed it with the ſhew of ſo much reſolution, that the <hi>German</hi> Foot thinking themſelves not able to reſiſt, quit the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and the Poſts, when the Cavalry gallopping to their aſſiſtance ſtopped the flight, and the Officers with their Swords in their hands killing ſome, brought back the reſt to their Guards. The <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who had no other aim but to divert ſuccours from the places attacqued, retired in good order. But <hi>Erizzo,</hi> who with <hi>Giovanni Martinengo, Marco Anthonio Manzano,</hi> and others, were marched out of <hi>Cividale</hi> to take in <hi>Ronzina,</hi> either deceived by their guides, or retarded by the difficulty of the way, arrived not till it was day, and ſo diſcovered; whereupon finding the Garriſon vigilant and in order, they could not apply the Pettard, neither did they think fit, by reaſon of the ſteepneſs of the cliff, to make tryal of an aſſault. Burning then certain Villages, and routing a body of Peaſants that would have ſtopped their paſſage, they returned ſafe into their Quarters.</p>
            <p>So many deſigns not ſucceeding, provoked <hi>Medici</hi> to new at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; whereupon he cauſes the Fort <hi>Boſco</hi> to be inveſted, where the exceſſive rains retarded the Beſiegers in ſuch ſort, that <hi>Traut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſtorf</hi> had opportunity, notwithſtanding the battery of two ſmall Pieces, to paſs the River with 600 Horſe, and fall into the Quarter of <hi>Piuma,</hi> which being ill defended by the <hi>Venetians</hi> in a great rain, which beat into their faces, was abandoned. The Troops, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſailed alſo by the Fort, retired, and <hi>Trautmanſtorf</hi> having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his deſign, leaves <hi>Piuma,</hi> into which the <hi>Venetians</hi> re-enter. Re-inforcements now arrive in both the Armies; in the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> 500 from the Archduke <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and 900 under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pay, beſides thoſe which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> himſelf in good number had raiſed; and in the <hi>Venetian</hi> 1000 <hi>Hollanders</hi> under Colonel <hi>Vaſſenhoven,</hi> and 3000 under <hi>Naſſau.</hi> Better men and better choſen than theſe, <hi>Italy</hi> had not in a long time ſeen, nor which carried with them more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and greater reflections; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> extremely vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that two ſo great Common-wealths, well underſtanding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and which had fixed the center of their liberty in common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, had found the way to unite the <hi>Adriatick</hi> with the Ocean, raged with great aggravations, holding forth the zeal of Religion, according to that cuſtom, that the moſt powerful do alſo love to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the moſt pious, and therewith beat the ears of the Pope, inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly inciting him to oppoſe himſelf againſt the entry into <hi>Italy</hi> of that ſort of people, who being of a differing Religion, might eaſily infect it.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Simeon Contarini</hi> Ambaſſador for the Republick, in his grave and graceful way of ſpeaking, remonſtrated to <hi>Paul; That the piety of the Senate, mindful of the ſignal actions of their Anceſtors, was an evident aſſurance of the conſtancy of their Religion, which having always been promoted, ſhould alſo at preſent by good orders and moſt vigilant endeavours be protected.

And ſo he truly appeared fixed in the preſervation of thoſe Poſts wherein he had once ſet his foot; but in proſecuting he was always carried away by violence, and with delays and errours corrupted the reſolutions of others, and his own counſels.</p>

            <p>There aroſe afterwards new diſputes with <hi>Naſſau,</hi> and all things paſſing with delays, the Enemy at firſt overcome with fear, took courage again, and bringing Colonel <hi>Stauder</hi> into <hi>Rubia</hi> with 1000 Foot guarded that place, and defended the <hi>Vipao.</hi> It ſeemed then, that that little River, which, where the Mountain terminates, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges it ſelf into the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> was become an Ocean, and the Fort <hi>Boſco</hi> a Wall of Braſs ſo; great was the reſiſtance, ſo impoſſible the fording! From two places with Batteries upon the Mountains was this Fort beaten, and with another from the other ſide of the River towards <hi>Mainizza.</hi> But <hi>Gradiſca</hi> was in this interim more ſtrongly begirt; for another Bridge being laid by the <hi>Venetians</hi> at <hi>Fara,</hi> it cloſed all paſſage on the upper ſide alſo. Nevertheleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the courſe of the ſeaſon, which was in the month of <hi>June,</hi> there falling inceſſant rains for forty days together, not only the Souldiers ſuffered very much in their Poſts, but the <hi>Vipao</hi> overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the <hi>Liſonzo</hi> much more, both the Bridges were broken, ſo that down the ſtream upon floats ſome proviſions entred into the Town. And now it ſeemed to be in earneſt, that time would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more inexcuſable <hi>Medici</hi> his delayings, diſcovering how much it imports not to make uſe of fair weather, or loſe one ſole moment of occaſion when it is offered. The Bridges however were repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but always with great longſomneſs, which gave <hi>Trautmanſtorf</hi> time to aſſemble his Army in <hi>Rubia,</hi> and better to fortifie the <hi>Vipao.</hi> This was his laſt action; for, aſſiſting at the raiſing of a Ravellin by a Cannon-bullet ſent from the Trenches of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> he unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately left his life upon the place. He had without doubt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the War, and defended the Archdukes Country with great reſolution, and that with weak Forces.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> now made themſelves believe, that, as it happens in the ſudden accidents of War, the minds of the Militia would be wavering, and the Chiefs be divided in their opinions. But <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radas</hi> preſently taking upon himſelf the abſolute Command, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

not the Army to be ſenſible of the loſs of <hi>Trautmanſtorf;</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the direction of the War with equal courage, and perhaps a better and more vigorous conduct. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> had indeed the good luck to take <hi>Parco,</hi> and to lodge themſelves there; but in the attempt of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Boſco</hi> environed with a Wall in form of a Square, and about a mile in circuit, but crooked and of unequal ſituation, they were repulſed. <hi>Gradiſca</hi> notwithſtanding the ſuccours began to ſuffer indeed; whereupon <hi>Straſoldo</hi> attempts to ſend out thoſe that were not uſeful for the defence; but the modern Armies underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other commendation but that of overcoming, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the <hi>Venetians</hi> to return into the Town. Some by ſtealth, under favour of the <hi>Starfort</hi> drave down the ſtream by night, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the Guards now and then took them Priſoners, bringing to the beſieged ſome ſlender relief. That Fort indeed ſerved as a Cittadel to the Town, and <hi>Naſſau</hi> had offered himſelf to take it when the others rendred themſelves to him; but ſome urged to the contrary, that that Garriſon would ſerve to famiſh the Town the ſooner, beſide the doubt, that having better defence it would not be taken with Batteries, and the Beſiegers then wanting earth be obliged to expoſe themſelves to hazard uncovered, if they would offend them.</p>
            <p>But the iſſue proved, that the number of votes rather than the weight of reaſons prevailed. For theſe factions in <hi>Friuli</hi> paſſed ſeven months, during which, firſt with Jealouſies, afterward with Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, the Republick was again greatly troubled in the <hi>Adriatick. Oſſuna,</hi> Vice-King of <hi>Naples,</hi> did not ſo much levy men for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> as he had propoſed with a Naval Force to moleſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> knowing that he could no where touch it more to the quick, than by infeſting the Dominion of the Sea, and diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Commerce, though with great damage to the Kings own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who drove a rich Trade with the City of <hi>Venice.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, againſt the gainſaying of all, and preferring before all other reſpects, that which might bring apprehenſions or diſturbance to the Republick, breaking the ſecurity of Ports, he had made booty of the Ship, the <hi>Pilgrim</hi> of <hi>Roſſi;</hi> and although upon the inſtance of the Ambaſſadour <hi>Gritti</hi> in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> command was given to releaſe it, nevertheleſs in the execution he always directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Orders of the King, either becauſe in the height of the pride of his mind he truly deſpiſed him, or becauſe that Crown was glad to cover their moſt ſecret deſigns with the diſobedience of a capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Miniſter. The <hi>Venetians</hi> were not ignorant of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fully reſolving to defend themſelves, made it their buſineſs to increaſe their ſtrength at Sea with two Galliaſſes and ſome Ships, and made choice of thirty Commanders of Gallies, to the end that according as there was need they might on all ſides be arming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oſſuna</hi> ſeeing that the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> had loſt many of their roving Neſts, invites them with the promiſe of a free Port and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences to retire into that Kingdom, careſſing them more and more, as they became more offenſive to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Whereupon
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53750:54"/>
under the countenance of ſuch a protection, theſe Pirates ſeized the Ship <hi>Doria,</hi> which with ſome other ſmall ones was paſſing from <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> with Merchants goods, ſelling publickly under the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the Viceroy the ſpoil they had taken; and although the Receivers of the Cuſtoms in the moſt principal Ports of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom exclaimed, that with Trade would alſo ceaſe the Tolls and Royal Entries, they were threatned by <hi>Oſſuna</hi> with the Gallows, if they ſhould dare any more to complain. He naturally abounding in the vanity of his tongue and thoughts, did not only apply to trouble the Sea, but diſcourſed continually of ſurpriſing Ports in <hi>Iſtria,</hi> ranſacking Iſlands, and making his way into the moſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable corners of the Capital City. Sometimes upon paper, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in diſcourſe he traced and drew out his deſigns, ordered Barks with flat bottoms fit for ſhallow waters, modelled this and that Engine, and hearkened ſo willingly to none as thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him with flatteries to his perſon, or facility in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, to ſay truth, that which he believed he ſhould be able to effect, was not ſo much, as that which he deſired ſhould be believed, deſigning to keep the Republick involved in great expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and diſtracted to ſuch a degree, that it might be leſs able to offend the Archduke, or aſſiſt <hi>Carlo.</hi> He then ſends forth under <hi>Franciſco Rivera</hi> into the <hi>Adriatick</hi> twelve well armed Ships; and although, when they were ready to ſet ſail, orders came from the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſuſpend their going forth, it ſeeming ſtrange, that at the time of the beginning of a Treaty of Peace in <hi>Madrid,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable injuries ſhould be done by the Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs taking pretext, that by ſome armed Veſſels of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick had been taken a great Ship, which would have gone into <hi>Trieſte,</hi> maintains his reſolution with a Writing extorted from the collateral Miniſters, who remonſtrated, that it was for the honour and ſervice of the King, that <hi>Rivera</hi> ſhould go out, and that the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> ſhould be kept under. Theſe Ships bore only the Dukes Colours, to the end the deſign might more ſecretly be carried on, not to let the War break out, nor leave the <hi>Venetians</hi> in peace. This Invaſion with armed Ships being againſt that Dominion, which the Republick for ſo many Ages had poſſeſſed in the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged <hi>Giuſt' Anthonio Belegno,</hi> that commanded the Fleet, to aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>Leſina</hi> that part of it which he could ſooneſt get ready, and from thence paſs to <hi>Curzola,</hi> to cover the Iſlands and the State, and in particular to break the principal deſign of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> to appear in the ſight of <hi>Iſtria,</hi> to give countenance to <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Army, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert that of the Republick. It was no hard matter to compaſs his deſign, becauſe the twelve Ships ſet their courſe to <hi>Calamota,</hi> a Port belonging to thoſe of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> where they were received with great applauſe of that Government, which to the prejudice of their Trade receiving very unwillingly Law from the <hi>Venetians</hi> upon the Sea, gladly heard this novelty of <hi>Oſſuna</hi>'s, and incouraging it with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervices, permitted that upon theſe Ships many of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53750:54"/>
ſhould take imployment. But <hi>Belegno</hi> following with ſeven Ships, four great Gallies, thirteen Lighters, and fifteen armed Veſſels, <hi>Riviera</hi> doubting to be aſſaulted with diſadvantage in that place, ſetting ſail with a fair wind croſſed the Sea, and came to <hi>Brindiſi.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> followed him, and not being able to fight them in that Port, which was well defended with ſeveral Forts, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which was <hi>Lorenzo Veniero,</hi> letting fall his Sails, defied him four hours long with Cannonades; but the other not willing to come out to an ingagement, he ranſacks all the Coaſt of <hi>Puglia.</hi> This motion of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had not only diſturbed the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but greatly alarmed the <hi>Turks,</hi> who taking jealouſie, came down in great numbers to the guard and preſervation of their marine Coaſt; and becauſe <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> to the end he might ingage with him the Gallies of the Pope, of <hi>Malta,</hi> and of <hi>Florence,</hi> publiſhed that he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the <hi>Ottoman</hi> State: The Miniſters of the <hi>Venetians</hi> cauſed the contrary to ſound aloud in all the Courts, it appearing that he had ſent to the Grand <hi>Viſier,</hi> Slaves and Peaſants to gain him, and with all ſorts of offices incite him to make War againſt the Republick. For this cauſe the ſaid Princes did not only abſtain from giving their Gallies to <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> but uſed all effectual means to divert him from ſending abroad ſuch rumours, knowing that they tended to nought elſe but to provoke the <hi>Turk,</hi> and draw him into the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> to the diſturbance of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Eccleſiaſtical State alſo.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Oſſuna</hi> ſtopping at nothing, ſo that he might gain at preſent, from the boldneſs of the attempt, fruit equal to the raſhneſs of the counſel, deſpiſing the conſcience of the fact, had brought into <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> as in triumph certain Merchandize, as if it had been taken at Sea by his Ships, though in truth it was the lading of the ſequeſtred Ship of <hi>Roſſi,</hi> and meaning by this applauſe to ſpread his deſigns, he ſends <hi>Pietro Leiva</hi> with nineteen Gallies to joyn with <hi>Riviera.</hi> They paſſed altogether to <hi>Santa Croce,</hi> which belongs likewiſe to thoſe of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> and found at <hi>Leſina</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> inferiour in ſtrength, the Gallies of <hi>Candia</hi> being not yet joyned, nor thoſe ten others with ſome Ships, which with all ſpeed were making ready at <hi>Venice.</hi> The Commanders then themſelves, not only croſſed by the wind, but counſelled chiefly by the diſparity of force, applied to nothing but their defence, placing on the Land certain pieces of Artillery in convenient places. So the Fleets cannoned a whole day at random with more ſhots than blows, and night coming on, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſtood away before the wind, taking a Ship of <hi>Sali.</hi> There fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their power alſo a Veſſel of <hi>Holland,</hi> which ſailing with ſome Souldiers of thoſe Levies, was like to be taken by the Ships of <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuna,</hi> and thought to find in the Port of <hi>Raguſa</hi> a ſafe retreat; but that Government permitting the Souldiery to paſs by Land to <hi>Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taro,</hi> put the Veſſel into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands, who cauſing the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be hanged, turned their courſe towards <hi>Brindiſi.</hi> From ſuch paſſages as theſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> more and more underſtood, what weight lay upon them of Arms, Jealouſies, and Negotiations; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53750:55"/>
therefore to maintain themſelves in liberty and ſafety, they deliberate greatly to re-inforce their Fleet, without weakening or diſtracting their Forces by Land. Conferring the Title with the Authority of Captain General upon <hi>Giovanni Giacomo Zane,</hi> they cauſed beſides other proviſions ten Gallies to be armed in <hi>Candia,</hi> which with a 1000 Souldiers raiſed in that Iſland arrive at laſt in the Gulph to joyn with the Fleet, after ſome retardment, cauſed partly for fear of falling amongſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, which they knew were laid for them, and partly for ſome regard had of the <hi>Turks</hi> Fleet, which with two great Hulks and ſeven and thirty Gallies plyed to and again in the white Sea, not ſo much to be taken notice of for their force, or the courage of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officers, as for the Negotiations of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> who commanding a nimble Frigat to the Captain <hi>Baſſa,</hi> had ſent him for a Preſent a Kinſman of his, till then kept Priſoner with the Spaniards, and giving liberty to a hundred other Slaves, invited him with ſuch flatteries and with expreſs Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to infeſt the State of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and particularly to command their Fleet to fall upon <hi>Candia.</hi> But the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves abhorring ſuch wicked counſels, ſet themſelves rather to make a courſe longſt the Coaſt of <hi>Calabria,</hi> but without doing hurt that was of the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. The Port being indeed throughly moved, threatned the <hi>Raguſians</hi> for the reception given to <hi>Oſſuna</hi>'s Ships, and invited the Republick to joyn Forces with them to ſuppreſs (as they called thoſe Magiſtrates) the common Enemies.</p>
            <p>But the Senate, though provoked by the example of the Vice-King, and invited by ſo grievous injuries, not willing to confound the intereſt of State with Religion, placed their defence in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of their cauſe and their own Arms, not omitting every where and in all Courts the diligence, offices, and forces to reſiſt ſo great a power. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, to terrifie with the fame of vaſt preparations, gave out that the Fleet of Gallions, accuſtomed only to the imployments of the Ocean, coming within the ſtraights of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> ſhould advance into the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> and that there was a new Armature of many Ships in <hi>Sicily;</hi> rumours in a good meaſure believed from the proceedings of the Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> who ſtrengthened the Squadron of <hi>Leiva</hi> with certain Gallies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Octavio d'Arragona,</hi> and gave liberty to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> to rove every where, and rejoyced already in the conceit, that with their Barks they would brave it within the ſight of the Ports of the Capital City, taking Priſes, and doing miſchief. This obliged the Senate to diſpoſe of certain Gallies for the guard of the <hi>Chioggia,</hi> and to pick out in <hi>Venice</hi> a number of people fit to bear Arms, who being new, and therefore more apt to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of, than they that were wont to be ſeen in War, kept the people in no ſmall unquiet. During theſe apprehenſions, a falſe and ſhort joy was the fore-runner of greater trouble. The Mariners of a Packet-boat bringing Letters with information of what had happened about <hi>Leſina,</hi> ſcattered a report every where as they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, either from their own invention, or a willing credulity of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53750:55"/>
others, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had obtained a great Victory; of which ſome bringing the firſt notice, the people greedy of the news, and deſirous of good ſucceſs, without giving time for greater certainty, overflowed with ſuch an exceſs of ſatisfaction, that running up and down with crys of applauſe, and making Bonfires in all the ſtreets, they were very near, if Guards had not been timely appointed, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hands on the perſon and houſe of the Ambaſſadour <hi>la Queva,</hi> believed the principal mover of the attempts of <hi>Oſſuna.</hi> But the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the report quickly appearing, one more troubleſom arrives upon it. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, increaſed to the number of eighteen Ships and three and thirty Gallies, ſhewing themſelves before <hi>Leſina,</hi> had provoked the <hi>Venetians</hi> to battel; and that coming out of the Port, ſhewed themſelves ready for the Encounter: But the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> diſcharging their Cannon afar off, gave them the ſlip in the night. Shewing themſelves again afterwards with the advantage of a fair wind, obliged the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that had it contrary, to ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the defence of the Harbour; whereupon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with the ſame propitious wind went and anchored at <hi>Trau vecchio,</hi> pillaging certain Barks, and burning ſome Cabanes there. <hi>Zane</hi> afflicted that the Enemy was ſo far advanced, and to ſee himſelf left behind, having no mind to abandon the great Ships, and ſeparate himſelf from them, hales them out of the Port with ſuch length of time as is uſual in diſorders of that nature, and makes to <hi>Spalato,</hi> to ſuppreſs any Incurſions and Hoſtility the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might attempt upon that Coaſt. But <hi>Lieva</hi> in the mean time paſſing ſpeedily with the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies towards <hi>Zara</hi> for a booty offering it ſelf caſually to him, was diverted from a greater Victory; becauſe the orders, he had, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed preciſely upon him to attempt the ſurpriſe and taking of <hi>Pola,</hi> or ſome other Port in <hi>Iſtria;</hi> but coming in ſight near <hi>Morter,</hi> a ſhelf of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> of two Merchant Gallies (Veſſels of great bulk for carriage, but not fit for fight, built eſpecially for the tranſport of Merchandize, which in great abundance paſs by long voyages re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally from <hi>Perſia, Turkie,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi>) whilſt, although newly come under the Convoy of ſeven Gallies of the Fleet, they ſailed with great negligence, ignorant of what had happened at <hi>Leſina,</hi> poſſeſſes himſelf of them.</p>
            <p>Upon the diſcovery of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, the Merchant Gallies run aſhore, the men ſaving themſelves, and the other provided for their ſafety with their Oars; but one not ſo nimble remained, though void of men, in the power of the Enemy, with ſome ſmall Veſſels which were Victuallers to the Fleet. By an action which made ſo great a noiſe, the Alarum was given every where, which made the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officers believe they ſhould find no place unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and having now the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet coaſting upon them, and being beſides embaraſſed with the Prizes and the rich Booty, croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Sea towards <hi>Mont Angelo,</hi> keeping cloſe to the ſhore, they got back to <hi>Brindiſi,</hi> and then the Gallies went out of the Gulph. <hi>Oſſuna</hi> not at all ſatisfied that for a piece of thievery there was loſt an opportunity of a more important conqueſt, ſharply reproved <hi>Lieva</hi>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:53750:56"/>
for it; nevertheleſs boaſting of the prey, cauſed the Wares and Ships to be brought into <hi>Naples</hi> with ſolemnity, much rejoycing at the diſpleaſure which appeared in <hi>Venice,</hi> and in the hopes to bring the Republick into War with the <hi>Turk;</hi> becauſe many of thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters being intereſſed in the Commodities taken, and others feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to be ſo, as that Court made profit by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, ſo they pretended to be repaired in the loſs by the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Nevertheleſs <hi>Almorò Nani Bailo</hi> had the good luck without much ado to ſtifle that noiſe, partly with reaſon which diſtinguiſhed the accident from the blame, and partly by change of the King, which diſordered for a time the Empire; whilſt to <hi>Achmet</hi> that was dead, paſſing by his two little Sons, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> his Brother ſucceeded. But at <hi>Venice</hi> they were not a little diſturbed at the news of this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and the blame being laid upon the delay of moving the Fleet from <hi>Leſina,</hi> and no leſs upon the negligent Convoy of the light Gallies, <hi>Pietro Foſcarini</hi> was ſent Inquiſitor to clear it, whether the Chiefs were to blame or not. To <hi>Zane</hi> was ſubſtituted <hi>Veniero</hi> in the Generalſhip, and thereupon the Command of the Ships being vacant, it was committed to <hi>Franceſco Moroſini.</hi> Some other Ships and Gallies beſides were ordered to be made ready together with the Gallion called <hi>il Balbi,</hi> of a vaſt bigneſs. All Courts did now ring in favour of the Republick, that under the pretext of Treaties and of Peace, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters had deſigned to give her a more cruel blow; and becauſe it was certain, that neither their Fortune nor Arts were pleaſing to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Senate ordered <hi>Simeon Contarini,</hi> returning from his Ambaſſie of <hi>Rome,</hi> to viſit <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> the Grand Duke, who had denied his Gallies to <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a certain ſum of money, ſent at firſt to <hi>Milan</hi> in aſſiſtance of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Kinſman.</p>
            <p>Thence he paſſed to the Dukes of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin, Modena, Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> giving them all to underſtand; <hi>That the moſt potent Engine of Foreign power in</hi> Italy <hi>was the patience of the Princes, for whom it was now time that they ſhould underſtand, how much the liberty of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was hated by Strangers, whilſt they accounted all that for the greateſt injury which was juſtly made uſe of to oppoſe their avarice and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But being held, even all of them, in the bonds of a greater dependency, they knew not what to do but wiſh better times for the common ſafety, every one having a ſenſe of the Common-wealths ſufferings; but no man moving in favour of it: Their greateſt hopes then were reduced to a diverſion in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> for which the <hi>Venetians,</hi> beſides the monthly diſburſements, furniſhing 80000 Crowns as an extraordinary aid to the Duke, had given him the means to draw <hi>Dediguieres</hi> once more into <hi>Italy,</hi> and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Army in ſuch vigour, that, whilſt <hi>Toledo</hi> had his men yet in their Quarters, St. <hi>Damiano</hi> was beſieged, a Town environed with a thick Wall, and a good Rampart of earth within it, and kept by <hi>Andrea Prando</hi> with 600 Souldiers; but he, miſerably burned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ruines of ſome houſes, the Garriſon, without a Commander, after five days battery was forced in a moſt furious aſſault.</p>

               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:53750:56"/>
               <hi>Dediguieres</hi> had honoured the Enterpriſe with his preſence, and the Duke during the conteſt running to and fro amongſt the foremoſt, had his Horſe killed under him, with the loſs of ſome few Souldiers, who being of no note remained, as uſual, buried in oblivion. The place given to pillage, was preſently demoliſhed, and the Duke lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waſte the Country, conſtrained <hi>Mortara</hi> and <hi>Davalos</hi> for want of victuals to quit <hi>Alba,</hi> who were entred into it with 4000 men. And now finding in it 1000 Souldiers only (<hi>Monferrines,</hi> mingled with ſome <hi>Germans</hi>) the Duke cauſes the Count St. <hi>Giorgio</hi> to inveſt it, and after draws near with the Army. The Governour, who was <hi>Alleramo,</hi> and one of the Counts of St. <hi>Giorgio</hi> alſo, but a deadly Enemy to <hi>Guido,</hi> made as if he would hold it out to the laſt, though it was in a manner open, yet environed on three ſides with the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro,</hi> and other little Rivers. The <hi>Germans</hi> lodged in the Out-works, and the Inhabitants had the defence of a Half-moon. The rains, which making the high-ways deep in mire, retarded for ſome days the Beſiegers in bringing their Cannon, and the attacque hindred alſo ſuccours to the Beſieged; ſo that for want of Ammunition they were forced to render. The City agreed for a ſum of money not to be plundered, and that the Garriſon ſhould not be <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> marched out with Arms and Baggage. The Town of St. <hi>Germano,</hi> where an intelligence failed the Duke, was preſently inveſted at large, and at the ſame time that of <hi>Montiglio</hi> was aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by St. <hi>Giorgio.</hi> The Town taken, kept but by 400 <hi>Monferrines,</hi> the Caſtle after a breach made is alſo rendred; for the cuſtody of which there aroſe a diſpute betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> with the death of more than an hundred of each ſide. In this diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Capitulation was alſo broken; for entring in confuſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Caſtle, they cut in pieces the Garriſon. <hi>Dediguieres</hi> after ſuch ſucceſſes, in which he aſſiſted with his help and counſel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his own Government, whilſt in <hi>France</hi> the Court, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve his partiality to the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> had ſuſpended ſeveral of his entertainments and profits. <hi>Toledo</hi> not regarding the ſlaughter and loſſes of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and reſolving not to repair anothers damage by an unſeaſonable conſuming his own Forces, and prejudice his own advantages, ſtays to re-inforce and reſt his Army till the end of <hi>May,</hi> and then coming into the field, cloſely beſieges <hi>Vercelli.</hi> So ſoon as he moved that way, St. <hi>Giorgio</hi> had happily put into it 1000 Muſquetiers, and 200 Horſe; ſo that the Garriſon conſiſted of 4000 men, and the Duke, incamped in the Town of <hi>Gabiano,</hi> had his aim to take in <hi>Ponteſtura,</hi> ſo to cut off the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from that important paſs; but finding a defence in better order than was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, he forbore to ingage in it, to be in greater readineſs to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the place already battered; and ſo much the rather, becauſe having diſcovered ſeveral treacheries, it was neceſſary both with his mind and perſon to be active in ſeveral places. In St. <hi>Ja</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſome <hi>French</hi> Officers had concerted to put fire to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, make the Prince <hi>Vittorio,</hi> who was there, their Priſoner, and give him up to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were to come in upon it to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

the deſign. But they that were found guilty by a Council of War of the Nation, to whoſe ſentence the Duke ſubmitted them, ſuffered puniſhment by the hand of the Hangman. A certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencal alſo was put in Priſon for having attempted to corrupt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to poyſon <hi>Carlo.</hi> He notwithſtanding amidſt all theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſhewed great conſtancy, and profeſſed to revenge himſelf for theſe treacheries upon the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> with Arms beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Prince. <hi>Toledo,</hi> having incloſed <hi>Vercelli</hi> with a large circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation, diſpoſes Batteries in four places, to which the beſieged with much boldneſs oppoſe theirs; <hi>Garzia Gomez</hi> General of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Artillery being killed, and <hi>Alphonſo Davalos</hi> ſo hurt by them, that he dyed ſoon after. They attempted afterwards with Sallies to drive the <hi>Germans</hi> from a Poſt upon the brink of the <hi>Seſia;</hi> but all they did was to demoliſh there a Fort, which was quickly repaired again. A great circuit of Out-works was the defence of the place, and ſome Trenches alſo kept the attacque far off, as much as was poſſible. But the beſiegers directed particularly their offence towards the <hi>Baſtion</hi> of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and under which the defendants, in the doubt they had to loſe it, had made a Mine, that it might rather ſerve the Enemy for a ſepulchre, than a place to lodge upon. It having not been poſſible to bring all things in abundance into the place after ſixteen days ſiege only, Ammunition was wanting, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they were forced to charge their Cannon and Muſkets with Tin and ſtones in the place of Iron and Lead. <hi>Carlo</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it in the beſt manner he could, at leaſt with powder, ſends the Signor <hi>Fleuri</hi> with 200 Horſe, and as many Sacks. But being met by a Party of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the powder which they carried behind them taking fire from the diſcharge of Harquebuſes, thirty only got in, and the reſt for the moſt part, being a miſerable ſpectable, were burnt. And now forty great Pieces battered the Walls with great violence, but two Half-moons were bravely defended, they within cutting to pieces in one Sally three hundred <hi>Germans,</hi> and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Horſe. That which covered the <hi>Baſtion</hi> of St. <hi>Andrea</hi> was poſſeſſed by the beſiegers, and regained by the beſieged. At laſt upon ſpringing a Mine, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made an effort to carry the place by a general aſſault. As they had equal motives, ſo the valour was not unequal, both in them that gave it, and them that received it; for if the one were driven on with the rewards of glory and the pillage, the other were exhorted by the ſafety of themſelves, their Country, and their families. Fire and Sword with the ſhedding of blood had pertinaciouſly their effect for a long time; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were forced to retire, and in that inſtant 100 Cuiraſſiers ſallying into the ditch with their Swords in their hands made a great ſlaughter. Fifteen hundred men, and amongſt them ſome of note, periſhed on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſide; of the beſieged the dead exceeded not a hundred. The Duke was in <hi>Livorno</hi> with 12000 Foot, and 1500 Horſe; to whom joyned 3000 <hi>Bearneſe,</hi> and he expected a Renfort from <hi>France;</hi> for by the death of <hi>d'Ancre</hi> the inchantment upon the Government being diſcharged, the Maxims and Councils were alſo changed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:53750:57"/>It hath been already hinted, what power that Stranger had in the Kingdom. The Armies depended upon his will, he iſſued forth the money, and diſpoſed of all Charges; ſo that he had the chief Miniſters depending upon him, and the Queen her ſelf had placed the ſtreſs of her Authority in the maintaining of him. He notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding pretended to ſubſiſt of himſelf, holding places and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Frontiers, and a Militia of Strangers, which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged nothing but his name and authority. But the people in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral hated him, the great ones abhorred him, and thoſe that were friends to the Crown deteſted his maxims. Howſoever having the Councils of <hi>Spain</hi> intereſſed in his ſafety, he thought in the favour of that Monarchy to enjoy a ſtrong ſupport. Some there were that doubted not but that his thoughts were to make himſelf be feared, and that he might, when he believed himſelf no longer ſecure in <hi>France,</hi> ſell to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> himſelf, the places and the Kingdom, at a high rate.</p>
            <p>That at leaſt was inſtilled into King <hi>Lewis,</hi> who in the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing age of eighteen years was amuſed by his Mother and the Favourite in childiſh toys, far from the knowledge of any buſineſs whatſoever. He therefore, melancholy by nature and loving ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, looked with delight upon that Authority which he had not yet enjoyed, and feeding himſelf with ſuſpicions, nouriſhed a bitter hatred againſt <hi>d'Ancre.</hi> Divers perſons of great birth, of his own age, and that had been bred up with him, began to find it ſtrange to ſerve a Prince, and that grace and favour ſhould depend upon the Miniſter. They ceaſed not therefore either with ſecret ſigns, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſayings, or covered diſcourſes, ſuch notwithſtanding as <hi>Lewis</hi> underſtood, to go on cenſuring the preſent Government, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the King himſelf under the direction and tutelage of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all, <hi>Monſieur de Luines</hi> got the aſcendant, a Gentleman of <hi>Avignon,</hi> of no great birth, expreſly put about the King, that he might take up his time in hunting and hawking and other leſſer pleaſures. But he with theſe inſnares him in ſuch ſort, that he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made the whole Kingdom his Quarry. Corrupting ſome of <hi>d'Ancres</hi> Domeſticks, he brings them to repreſent to the King his actions, deſigns, and the means to preſerve himſelf in his greatneſs, with ſo much horrour and deteſtation of <hi>Lewis,</hi> as yet without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that not thinking himſelf ſecure, either as to his life or Kingdom, he reſolves without delay to rid himſelf of ſo formidable a Miniſter. His death was betwixt a few reſolved on; the King is perſwaded to it out of a deſire to exerciſe his Office, and make tryal of his Authority. <hi>Luines</hi> hopes to inherit the favour and the ſpoil; and <hi>Monſieur de Vitri,</hi> a Captain of the Guards, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to kill him, thought to oblige the young Prince to him by the firſt fruits of his command. The Mareſhal then incertain of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny, proudly entring into the Royal Palace of the <hi>Louvre</hi> the four and twentieth day of <hi>April,</hi> ſees the door clapt to behind him, and in the ſame inſtant <hi>Vitri</hi> making a ſhew to arreſt him, <hi>d'Ancre</hi> falls
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53750:58"/>
dead with the ſhots of three Piſtols. The buſineſs was no ſooner di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, but the Queen-mother, doubtful what ſhould become of her ſelf, breaks forth into a flood of complaints. Thoſe that had been of the Confidence, fearing the ſame chaſtiſement, diſperſed in diſorder. But the people, who are moved with every blaſt, running amongſt them upon a report that the King was betrayed and wounded, took Arms; but aſſured of the contrary by the chief Miniſters, who rode through the ſtreets quieting the tumult, turned their fear into glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and deteſting the life and name of the dead, let the World ſee, That the luſtre of favour is glorious, but a thing ſo tender and weakly, that going out with every puff it ſtinks at laſt, and is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious. The Corps ignobly buried was taken up again, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled into little pieces was burnt, the aſhes carried through the ſtreets to ſell, and bought by many at a great rate, to vent the publick ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and private revenge. The King greatly rejoycing, that the judgment of the people did juſtifie the violence of the fact, ſends away the Confidents of the dead, amongſt whom was the Biſhop of <hi>Luſſon,</hi> who retired to <hi>Avignon.</hi> The Marqueſs his Wife was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly beheaded, and the Queen-mother confined to <hi>Blois.</hi> And now thoſe great ones, who, upon <hi>Conde</hi>'s impriſonment, had been kept from Court, returned. The Prince nevertheleſs was not ſet at liberty, becauſe the King, contented by his own occaſion to know his Authority, left the height of favour to <hi>Luines,</hi> and he with wonted craft conſidering how to eſtabliſh himſelf in that condition, reſolved, with the price of the liberty of two ſuch Priſoners, to play the Merchant with both for his own conveniences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> with this ſudden change might be ſaid to be reſtored to it ſelf, and gained to <hi>Italy,</hi> becauſe the King ſtood in much jealouſie of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by reaſon of their confidences which he had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the Queen-mother and with <hi>d'Ancre.</hi> The reconciled Princes were addicted enough to <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the progreſs of the War in the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> gave that Crown juſtly to underſtand, how much of its honour and intereſt, till now neglected, was treated there. And therefore underſtanding the danger <hi>Vercelli</hi> was in, <hi>Lewis</hi> expreſſed himſelf to the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain, That if ſome ſudden compoſure were not found out, he ſhould be conſtrained to make good his obligation, and maintain</hi> Carlo <hi>in the Treaty of</hi> Aſti. In this interim he gives the Duke leave to raiſe what <hi>French</hi> he deſired, and ſends to the Borders of <hi>Savoy</hi> 6000 Foot and 2000 Horſe to go forward into <hi>Italy</hi> where there ſhould be need. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyons</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great diligence to <hi>Rome,</hi> communicates to the Pope the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the King in favour of the Duke; and ſeeing a young Prince that inclined to War, and gave from his Race future preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his Government; every one believed a flood of Armies in <hi>Italy</hi> was to follow, and an open Rupture betwixt the Crowns. And therefore the Pope did not only double his endeavours for Peace, but an Union was ſpoken of by ſome of thoſe Princes (and particularly the Grand Duke) who knew they had offended <hi>France</hi> by having ſuperciliouſly adhered to the other Party. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>

apprehending at firſt <hi>Lewis</hi>'s threatnings, and, to pacifie him, readily ſhewing a deſire to Peace, afterwards being aſſured that that Kingdom would not remain ſo quiet, but was within a while to expect a new <hi>Criſis,</hi> which promoting with Arts, Friends and Money, and with the help of ſome of the chief Miniſters, who diſ-inclined from having any thing to do with the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> they proceeded in the ſiege and in their deſigns. The truth was, that the firſt heat of the <hi>French</hi> cooling again, the moſt ſecret inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeared to be as not to let <hi>Piedmont</hi> be loſt, yet ſo as not to break with <hi>Spain.</hi> Thus with appearances, propoſals and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to hinder it, <hi>Vercelli</hi> was near being loſt; for all the Half-moons were now taken. The <hi>Neapolitans</hi> with their approaches having cut their paſſage into the Ditch, had a breach open in the Bulwark of St. <hi>Andrea;</hi> and towards the River on the other ſide the <hi>Walloons</hi> had made another. The Garriſon from duty and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appeared to be greatly diminiſhed, and for want of powder had at laſt reſolved to take that out of the Mine under the <hi>Baſtion</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned. No experiment to get ſome in by ſtealth had ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The Duke thereupon applying himſelf to force, draws near to the Enemies Camp by night, placing longſt the <hi>Seſia</hi> 9000 Foot with 1400 Horſe, and 10 ſmall Pieces. Three thouſand Foot and 400 Horſe were appointed for the relief, and there ſtood in the Rear the <hi>French</hi> under the Marqueſs <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rfè,</hi> Signor <hi>di Chigliè,</hi> and the Baron <hi>di Rairan,</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> commanded by the Serjeant Major of the Marqueſs of <hi>Caluſo,</hi> and the Signor of <hi>Parella.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Duke cauſed the Alarm to be given, the Arrierguard aforeſaid divided into ſeveral Parties, and <hi>d'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rfè</hi> having paſſed the <hi>Seſia,</hi> met by a Body of Horſe, and forced to fight, was defeated with the loſs of 600 men: But whilſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> haſted to that ſide, 1000 men entred into <hi>Vercelli</hi> on the other, with ſome pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, though not ſo much as was proportionable to the want. For all this, <hi>Toledo</hi> ſlackens not his attacque, but re-inforcing with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Cannons more his battery of the Fort St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> cauſed another aſſault to be given ſo vigorous, that the effect was to ſee himſelf lodged upon the breach. The place then capitulates, agreeing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der honourable conditions to deliver the Town and Cittadel. The Siege laſted two months, during which were diſcharged 67000 ſhot of Artillery. The Enemy loſt 6000 Souldiers, and 67 Captains, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome perſons of Quality. <hi>Giovanni Bravo</hi> with a ſtrong Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon enters into it as Governour. The Marqueſs of <hi>Caluſo,</hi> who came out of it, notwithſtanding the Fathers favour, was forced for a while to forbear the Dukes angry preſence; but being guilty of nothing but ill fortune, was quickly reſtored to his former favour. The Duke with this loſs felt himſelf touched to the quick, and apprehended conſequences yet worſe, fearing leſt <hi>Toledo</hi> ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Aſti;</hi> whereupon to divert that thought, and to ſhew courage in his ill fortune, finding his Army ſtrong 18000 Foot and 3000 Horſe, and not a little heartned with <hi>Dediguieres</hi> preſence, who, by the Kings conſent being newly come again into <hi>Italy,</hi> had brought with
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53750:59"/>
him ſome men under the Dukes pay, and ſome Troops that carried the Colours, he reſolves to enter into the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi> Leaving <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nona, la Rocca,</hi> and <hi>Rocchetta</hi> behind him, he inveſts <hi>Feliſano,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> forcing the Barricadoes, and entring the Trenches, fifteen hundred <hi>Germans</hi> together with the Inhabitants were cut to pieces, the Officers made Priſoners, and nine Colours taken. Going thence to <hi>Quattordici,</hi> an open place, where were lodged 300 men, leaving their Arms they were obliged to ingage, not to ſerve any more againſt <hi>Carlo.</hi> Out of <hi>Renfracore,</hi> which rendred it ſelf, 200 <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> were permitted to march out with their Arms and Colours, in reſpect to the Nation, with whom the Duke was in alliance. <hi>Toledo,</hi> who in the Siege of <hi>Vercelli</hi> had harraſſed and diminiſhed his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had now ſeparated them into ſeveral Quarters to refreſh; but moved with the Dukes bold attempt, aſſembles his Army at <hi>Soleri.</hi> Nevertheleſs ſuffers <hi>Annona</hi> to be taken in his ſight, a weak place, but garriſoned with 2000 men, who after a ſhort battery of ſix Pieces marched out, life and Arms ſaved. <hi>La Rocca d' Araſſo</hi> alſo, and <hi>la Rocchetta,</hi> with the ſpoil of 500 Souldiers, yielded.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſucceſſes contributed to the heightning of <hi>Carlo</hi>'s reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who always appeared above all misfortunes; but in effect the advantage was much leſs than the noiſe, becauſe they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe the loſs of <hi>Vercelli,</hi> whereof not only the Duke, but the <hi>Venetians</hi> were very ſenſible. Nevertheleſs, to uphold a gravity in the Negotiation equal to the conſtancy of their minds, the Senate with the conſent of the Duke, after the Invaſions of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Gallies, and the rendring of <hi>Vercelli,</hi> recals the powers give their Ambaſſadour <hi>Gritti</hi> to treat a Peace in <hi>Spain.</hi> For the diſpatch to <hi>Madrid</hi> of neceſſary powers concerning this Negotiation, the Archduke was carried to the Court of the Emperour <hi>Matthias,</hi> and there had pretended, that the Ambaſſadour of the Republick ſhould not appear in the Churches, or on any other occaſion when he was preſent. But the Emperour, not willing to paſs beyond the Mediation to a partiality, remained reſolute to oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>The Archduke had other greater concerns preſſing upon his mind; for all the Line of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second, though numerous, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to fail without poſterity, the Fortune of the Empire was to devolve into his Houſe. And for that cauſe he was tyed to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the bonds of greater confidence, and they expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted it with certain hopes to caſt the Empire according to their arbitrement, when it ſhould fall upon <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> The Archdukes <hi>Albert</hi> and <hi>Maximilian,</hi> Brothers to the Emperour, wanting iſſue, eaſily yielded their pretenſions and hopes; but it was a hard matter to bring <hi>Matthias</hi> to it, who heard not willingly the diſcourſe of celebrating in his life time the Funerals of his Authority and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. He nevertheleſs inſinuates to him the ceſſion of the Title only of King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> for prevention of thoſe accidents, which to Religion and the Family, in caſe of his death, might in the <hi>Interregnum</hi> be feared; becauſe it being not certain, whether it be Elective or Hereditary, the minds of the people ſufficiently
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53750:59"/>
prepared for it, might be moved; and if it ſhould fall into other hands, or to a Proteſtant Prince, the Election it ſelf of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would run a great hazard, in the parity of ſix other Electors equally divided into Catholicks and Hereticks themſelves. Upon ſuch effectual motives, the Emperour at laſt lets himſelf be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> although with all earneſt they inclined to the advancement of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> yet would not quit their advantages in view; and therefore the conſent of King <hi>Philip,</hi> the Son of <hi>Anna</hi> Daughter of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second, ſeeming neceſſary, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a vaſt compenſation for it. Upon this ſcore it was divulged, that the Towns of <hi>Iſtria</hi> ſhould be yielded to them, with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Goritia,</hi> and with all that more which the Archduke poſſeſſed in <hi>Italy;</hi> but that tended only to give jealouſie to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in truth all the Country was moved at the report, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be bound up, both by Sea and by Land, with ſuch Fetters as were not to be ſhaken off.</p>
            <p>An agreement was afterwards privately ſtipulated betwixt the Archduke and the Count <hi>d'Ognate,</hi> which contained <hi>Philips</hi> ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Rights to the hereditary Provinces in <hi>Germany,</hi> in favour of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and his Brothers, and of their deſcendants maſculine; but that failing, they to return to the Houſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> of which the Females were to be preferred before thoſe born in <hi>Germany.</hi> In recompence it was promiſed to give up <hi>Alſatia</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to maintain them in the poſſeſſion: they bound themſelves to grant reciprocal Levies, and that the one ſhould not confer benefits or favours on the Vaſſals of the other but by the approbation of his own Prince or his Miniſters. That part nevertheleſs which concerned <hi>Alſatia</hi> was never executed, for fear of making too great a commotion amongſt the Princes of the Empire, and indeed of all <hi>Europe.</hi> The deſign notwithſtanding of uniting the two Houſes, and extending their limits, coming to be known, ſuch was the jealouſie of many Princes, that that Treaty may juſtly be called the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-ſtone of the calamities of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Original of the great accidents that enſued.</p>
            <p>But for the Treaty with the Republick, the Count <hi>d'Ognate</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving proteſted to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that the management thereof would not be ſuffered to paſs through other hands than thoſe of <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, the Count <hi>Franciſco Chefniller</hi> was diſpatched into <hi>Spain</hi> as Ambaſſadour Extraordinary from <hi>Matthias,</hi> and the Archduke (who ſhall henceforth be called King of <hi>Bohemia</hi>) and he carried the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute intentions of <hi>Matthias</hi> and <hi>Gleſelio,</hi> his chief Miniſter, that by all means a Peace was to be made. But at <hi>Madrid</hi> blocks in the way were not wanting; for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters pretended, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould firſt reſtore what they had taken, and then <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould fulfil the agreement, but without burning the Barks, or baniſhing but ſome few of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi;</hi> and for the affairs of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> they inſiſted upon the Dukes diſarming: after which things they offered a reſtitution of all, yet without any preſcription of time, or obligation on their ſide to lay down Arms. But <hi>Gritti</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:53750:60"/>
foreſeeing that they joyntly aimed at the predominancy in <hi>Italy,</hi> and to weary out the Princes in jealouſies, ſuſtained, that for common quiet and ſecurity the diſarming of the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> ought alſo to be concerted, and as to the intereſts of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi,</hi> inſiſts, that thoſe three ſorts ſhould be baniſhed, which the Republick had already declared; and for the reſt, that the agreement in <hi>Vienna</hi> ſhould be preciſely executed. For ſome kind of temperament it was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Lerma,</hi> that the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould firſt render the places in <hi>Iſtria; Ferdinand</hi> then, to perform the promiſes on his ſide, and after that the Republick ſhould withdraw their Arms out of <hi>Friuli,</hi> the word of his King remaining ſecurity for the due execution of the Treaty. But in this preſent ſtate of affairs the news arriving, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were ſafely landed in <hi>Italy, Lerma</hi> in anger proteſts to <hi>Gritti,</hi> that if the Treaty were not concluded within one day, he would hold it for broken. The Ambaſſadour complaining, that the means of neceſſary defence ſhould be converted into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts of a moſt unjuſt War, ſhewed himſelf very indifferent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Negotiation were continued or broken. <hi>Chefniller</hi> gave out, that the Negotiation coming to diſſolve in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſhould re-aſſume it elſewhere, and the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſeeming to wonder, that <hi>Lerma</hi> ſhould proceed with ſuch paſſion, the Secretary <hi>Aroſtighi</hi> comes to <hi>Gritti</hi> to excuſe the Dukes heat, and to ſignifie to him in the Name of the King, that he held not the Treaty otherwiſe broken, than that he reſerved wholly to himſelf the power to approve the Articles treated on, when he ſhould know they were accepted by the Senate. The Ambaſſadour thereupon equally diſapproves the things propoſed and the form. <hi>Lerma</hi> then at laſt calls together the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> and him of <hi>Venice,</hi> offering to the two firſt, that as to <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Capitulation of <hi>Aſti</hi> ſhould not be altered, and as to the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> they reſtoring the half of the places poſſeſſed, and afterwards the reſt at twice, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould alſo go on alternatively in the execution of that which ſome years paſt had already been agreed upon at <hi>Vienna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gritti,</hi> not at all ſatisfied with this, requires, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould firſt ſettle in <hi>Segna</hi> the Garriſon agreed upon, that then the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſhould quit one place in <hi>Iſtria,</hi> and that, all the reſt afterwards being executed, Arms ſhould be every where withdrawn. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Lerma</hi> not diſſenting, certain Articles were drawn; but in the affair of <hi>Carlo</hi> the Ambaſſadour ſuſtaining, that by reaſon of new accidents it was neceſſary there ſhould be ſome explication and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Treaty of <hi>Aſti,</hi> the whole buſineſs thereupon was at a ſtand. Things ſtanding in this poſture at <hi>Madrid, Gritti</hi> receives the revocation of his powers; for the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Duke being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated to extremity againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have the Treaty tranſported to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> where the change of Government opened a way to hopes of a better minding of the affairs of <hi>Italy. Gritti</hi> then had no other Commiſſion but to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53750:60"/>
ratifie and ſee that worded which ſhould be concluded at <hi>Paris</hi> by the Ambaſſadours <hi>Bon</hi> and <hi>Guſſoni;</hi> and King <hi>Lewis</hi> was aſſured, that <hi>Carlo</hi> being ſatisfied in the point of diſarming, the Senate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented not from the ſubſtance of that which had been in Propoſition at <hi>Madrid</hi> about the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi;</hi> adding only in conſideration of late emergencies the reſtitution of Ships and the Merchandize ſtayed and made prize of by <hi>Oſſuna:</hi> and the rather becauſe the repriſals could not be called juſt, whilſt <hi>Spain</hi> declared not to be in enmity or rupture with the Republick. <hi>Gradiſca</hi> in the mean time being brought to the laſt gaſp, the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Commanders imployed all their power to make it ſubſiſt. Several reliefs having not ſucceeded to get in by ſtealth, they reſolved paſſing on this ſide the <hi>Liſonzo</hi> with 600 Horſe and 400 experienced Foot to attempt the Line to make way for the ſuccours; but being repulſed by the Guards of Horſe upon them, the action proved very bloody. Of the <hi>Venetians</hi> were killed <hi>Marc Anthonio Manzano, Pietro Avogadro,</hi> and <hi>Leonoro Gualdo,</hi> perſons of Noble birth, and all their Captains of Horſe. The loſs in other reſpects appeared not unequal. The night following, the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> having a mind to make another attempt, the breaking of ſome of the floats, upon which they were to paſs over, ſuſpended the effect. But on the other ſide, a while after they aſſaulted thoſe Batteries which incommoded <hi>Rubia,</hi> and driving out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt, which was moſt advanced, four Companies of <hi>Switzers</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in their negligence, and killing ſome Cannoniers, who would have made reſiſtance, they entred into the Quarter even to the lodging of <hi>del Lando,</hi> where they were oppoſed by ſome <hi>Corſi,</hi> till <hi>Don Giovanni</hi> coming with ſome ſuccours forced them to retire. The Battery was preſently recovered, and ſome Cannon being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nailed, and turned upon the Enemy, made a great ſlaughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. <hi>Marradas</hi> and <hi>D'Ampierre</hi> ſtill applying their minds to new attempts, laying a Bridge over the Plain of <hi>Mainizza</hi> paſſed the River, and convoying ſome proviſions with a great body of men, finding the Line ill guarded, and having had the encounter only of a few Horſe, brings them happily into <hi>Gradiſca. Naſſau</hi> was commanded by the Bridge of <hi>Fara</hi> with 600 Muſquetiers to charge them in the flank; but doing it out of time, and the <hi>Germans</hi> under the favour of the Town fording the <hi>Liſonzo,</hi> by the Hills of the <hi>Carſo</hi> got ſafe into their Quarter. <hi>Marradas</hi> encouraged by this, with 800 Horſe and 500 Muſquetiers aſſaults ſome Quarters upon the ſame Hills, forcing certain Trenches, and although at that time repulſed, yet upon a ſecond attempt he was able to bring powder and meat by the way of <hi>Dobredo</hi> into the Fort <hi>Stella,</hi> from whence it was afterwards carried into <hi>Gradiſca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Camp of the <hi>Venetians</hi> was found weakened by its ſuffering, and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in particular, not accuſtomed to the Climate, were afflicted with ſeveral diſeaſes, of which <hi>Naſſau</hi> himſelf dies in <hi>Monfalcone,</hi> and <hi>Lando</hi> falls deſperately ſick. It was therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to reduce the Quarters into a leſſer compaſs, and to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don St. <hi>Michaele,</hi> whence <hi>Marradas</hi> arguing a greater weakneſs,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53750:61"/>
took heart to aſſault them, but was vigorouſly repulſed with the death of 300 of his own. Diſcovering afterwards preparations to hazard anew ſuccours, the <hi>Venetians</hi> reſolved to encounter it near to St. <hi>Martino</hi> with 300 Foot under <hi>Oratio Baglione.</hi> The Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered to be more than had been ſuppoſed, which through by-ways conveyed a certain quantity of meal; the Prince of <hi>Eſte,</hi> returned to the Camp in the place of <hi>Medici</hi> who was indiſpoſed, gave <hi>Baglione</hi> advertiſement, that without ingagement he ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf till <hi>He</hi> might arrive with a Renfort proportionable. But the Enemies eagerneſs gave not time for the advertiſement; whereupon the fight beginning, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who to croſs upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral paſſages were obliged to an order too diſtant from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were defeated. A Company of <hi>German</hi> Cuiraſſiers lighting on foot, with their Swords in their hands, did the greateſt execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, few ſaved themſelves; 80 were made Priſoners, the reſt with <hi>Baglione</hi> himſelf, <hi>Verginio Orſino, Lamentana,</hi> and <hi>Giamaco Alberti</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Captain, were left dead upon the place. The Senate, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe with immortal memory to poſterity a life loſt in the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his age, erected in the Church of St. <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> a goodly Monument for <hi>Oratio,</hi> who with equal teſtimony of his fidelity and courage had in this War made his Name famous above any other. Theſe reliefs to <hi>Gradiſca,</hi> though frequent, yet ſcanty, ſufficed not to ſecure it from being taken at laſt; the <hi>Germans</hi> therefore put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves upon new attempts by artificial Fire-works, took upon them to burn the Bridge at <hi>Fara;</hi> but the Engine being in diſorder, it came to nothing. The <hi>Venetians</hi> on the other ſide, to cut off communication with the Fort <hi>Stella,</hi> by means whereof ſuccours entred into <hi>Gradiſca</hi> and ſome unprofitable mouths were got out, made a quarter at <hi>Drauſina,</hi> ſtraightning the beſieged in ſuch ſort, that the Fort wanted water, and the Town was brought to extremity. The Inhabitants had ſent to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Baron of <hi>Ech,</hi> to inform him, that now at laſt their fidelity was invaded by the utmoſt neceſſity; and to <hi>Milan,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Trieſte,</hi> to ſollicite <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo</hi> to ſome vigorous diverſion. He in the hotteſt of his actings in <hi>Piedmont</hi> had always kept a good number of men on the Borders of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and they having kept them well provided, left no place but for reciprocal Jealouſies and good heed, till <hi>Vercelli</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be taken, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> increaſing the number of their Militia, ſuſpicions were alſo increaſed on this other ſide; for Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being making at <hi>Lodi,</hi> and other Preparatives given order for, it ſeemed that the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> had his eye upon ſome ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal and attacques, and particularly of <hi>Crema.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this very Juncture a Courrier from <hi>Spain</hi> brings the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Capitulation of Peace as it had been firſt concluded at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the King and his Miniſters, deſirous above meaſure that the affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould be compoſed without being obliged to imploy their Arms in that War, had perſwaded <hi>Carlo</hi> to conſent to diſarm under the word and faith of that Crown, and the Duke
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53750:61"/>
had not made difficulty to approve it, becauſe deſpairing to recover <hi>Vercelli</hi> by force, he deſired by all means to have it by ſome Treaty. Then concerning the affairs of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the Duke <hi>de Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leone</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> not having the powers neceſſary, had given aſſurance under his hand-writing, that at <hi>Madrid</hi> they ſhould not recede a tittle from what had formerly been concerted betwixt <hi>Lerma</hi> and <hi>Gritti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadours of the <hi>Venetians</hi> hereupon making no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, perſiſted only in the pretence that the reſtitution of the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize and Ships might be comprehended in the agreement. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions and power concerning that point being not yet come from <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters glad to have happily gotten the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had endeavoured with ſo much noiſe to arrogate to themſelves alone, for prevention of any evil accident, obliged the foreſaid Ambaſſadours to be contented, that King <hi>Lewis</hi> ſhould promiſe in writing to interpoſe with his Father-in-law his moſt effectual offices for the reſtitution. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> to ſay truth, had inſtructions to the contrary; but having a jealouſie, that, the affairs of <hi>Piedmont</hi> being compoſed, in which the Duke, inamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a ſecret Propoſition of Marriage of a Siſter of that King with the Prince <hi>Vittorio,</hi> as a caution of the Treaty, ſhewed himſelf contented, the Republick ſhould be left alone and expoſed to an inundation of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> after ſome heſitation gave their conſent. Upon the ſixth of <hi>September</hi> then was a writing under-written, in which, referring themſelves, as the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi,</hi> to the Articles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready adjuſted in <hi>Spain,</hi> there was added over and above for the obſervance of them the word of <hi>France,</hi> and for the reſtitution of the things made prize of, Mediations and Offices were promiſed; to <hi>Carlo</hi> were confirmed the Articles of <hi>Aſti,</hi> with the promiſe of <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Vercelli</hi> ſhould be reſtored to him.</p>
            <p>It did not, to ſay truth, appear, that the Capitulation did unite in the expreſſions of it, as was deſired, the intereſts of the Republick with thoſe of the Duke; but by <hi>Gritti,</hi> to whom the Ambaſſadours in <hi>France,</hi> as they had it in commiſſion, referred the extenſion of the whole Treaty, it was fully ſupplied. So that in <hi>Madrid</hi> the 26. the <hi>September</hi> the agreement was ſigned, in which the reciprocal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the quiet of Chriſtendom and of <hi>Italy</hi> being premiſed, it was through the mediation of the Pope and <hi>France</hi> agreed, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> placing a Garriſon of <hi>Germans</hi> in <hi>Segna,</hi> the Republick ſhould render one place in <hi>Iſtria</hi> at the choice of the Emperour and of <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> after that, by the meeting of two Commiſſioners on each ſide it ſhould within twenty days be declared, that the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocchi,</hi> which were to be far removed from <hi>Segna</hi> and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime places, were to be accounted Adventurers and Banditi, which imploy themſelves in Piracies; except thoſe that dwelt quietly in their houſes, or which had only been guilty of ſome Hoſtility in this preſent War. The Barks imployed in this Pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy were to be burnt. All this being performed, the <hi>Venetians</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to withdraw their Garriſons from all places taken. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53750:62"/>
from the beginning of the excution of the Treaty two months were to be allowed, Fortifications and Hoſtility by Land and by Sea were preſently to ceaſe on both ſides, all things being to be executed within the ſaid time, and then Commerce to begin, which alſo was to take place, though the execution ſhould require more than two months. The Treaty of <hi>Vienna</hi> was word for word inſerted, and the point of free Navigation referred to another time; Priſoners according to cuſtom were releaſed, and were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under a general oblivion thoſe Subjects which had ſerved on the other ſide. The Catholick King for performance received the word of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and he gave it reciprocally that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould not reſtore the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi,</hi> nor any one damage be felt from them, ſuſpending equally his Arms, and Hoſtility every where cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Then, as to what concerns <hi>Savoy, Gritti</hi> capitulates with <hi>Lerma,</hi> that the Treaty of <hi>Aſti</hi> ſhould be executed, places and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners reſtored, all offences betwixt <hi>Carlo</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> laid aſide; all which was to be ratified within forty days, if in that interim no other accord were made in <hi>Italy</hi> with <hi>Toledo,</hi> which in that caſe was to take place.</p>
            <p>Concerning the reſtitution of things pretended by the <hi>Venetians</hi> by the depredations of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> conſents not that they ſhould be mentioned in the Treaty, but orders <hi>la Queva,</hi> that in the Name of the King he ſhould give his word for it to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. In this Treaty, which is called the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> the will of <hi>Matthias</hi> that the affairs of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> ſhould be compoſed had great influence; and alſo the deſire of <hi>Lerma</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould not be ingaged further in the affairs of <hi>Italy;</hi> as to other things aiming rather to make an end of the War, than to confirm the Peace. When the firſt adviſe from <hi>Paris</hi> arrived at <hi>Venice,</hi> the news was generally received with great joy, and by the Senate ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that having obtained the expulſion of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi,</hi> and the obſervance always pretended of the agreement in <hi>Vienna,</hi> their Rights were not only with great grace maintained, but their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions juſtified; and although they had not made by the War any particular progreſſes of advantage, nevertheleſs the Common-wealth with great conſtancy had without all accidents, never receded from the point, reduced <hi>Gradiſca</hi> to extremity, taken many places, loſt nothing of their own, and at the ſame time, reſiſting the jealouſies of <hi>Toledo,</hi> defended the Sea from <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> together with the dignity of <hi>Carlo</hi> preſerved the glory and common liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting Authority with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> called in <hi>France</hi> to take part in the Treaty and in the Warranty of the Conditions. Some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, more tenacious in the cuſtoms of the Country, did not in the formality of the Treaty acknowledge the wonted punctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and obedience of the Miniſters, becauſe the Ambaſſadours had tranſgreſſed their Commiſſions; neither did it appear, that <hi>Mante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leone</hi> had a ſufficient authority; but that it was believed, that they were ſtill to depend upon the abſtruſe ſenſe and myſterious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of <hi>Spain,</hi> whilſt poſſibly in <hi>Italy</hi> the Forces and the Courage
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53750:62"/>
ſlackning, and what concerns <hi>Piedmont</hi> being executed, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth would remain looſned from the union with the Duke, and ſeparated from the common intereſts. Amidſt theſe opinions the reſpect to <hi>France</hi> prevailing, to whom the mediation was volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily offered, it was reſolved to approve the Treaty, but at the ſame time to recal the Ambaſſadours to impriſonment to expiate their diſobedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simeon Contarini</hi> Cavalier, was ſent as an Extraordinary into <hi>France,</hi> to inform the King of the juſt motives the Senate had for it; but <hi>Lewis</hi> being ſomething troubled that the Ambaſſadours ſhould be puniſhed for that, which in contemplation of himſelf they ſeemed to have incurred, paſſed ſuch effectual Offices in their favour, that at laſt being once called home, the puniſhment was pardoned. All being approved at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which had been agreed at <hi>Paris,</hi> the advice of the concluſion was by an Expreſs diſpatched from the Court to the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> cauſing him to be held up by the way, whom the Ambaſſadour <hi>Gritti</hi> ſent to <hi>Venice,</hi> to the end that the knowledge of it arriving, before others, to the Miniſters of the Crown, they might, in the execution of the things agreed, the better reſolve that, which the conjunction and ſtate of things ſhould counſel them; and to ſay truth, <hi>Toledo</hi> upon it was wavering amidſt various thoughts; for ſome perſwaded him to ceaſe from all action, not to diſcompoſe the Peace, and others ſtirred him up to go on with his Arms. The Biſhop of <hi>Trieſte</hi> above all ſhewed what a great hazard <hi>Gradiſca</hi> ran, remonſtrating that it could not hold out ſo long as the time prefixed for the ratifications of the Treaty; in which caſe, in the very cloſe of the War, the <hi>Venetians</hi> would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come triumphant, not without a blot upon the reputation of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and ignominy upon their Arms. <hi>Toledo</hi> at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves either to preſerve it by a diverſion, or to bring the Common-wealth to ſome agreement whereby to ſave the place, or, if it ſhould be taken, to oblige them to reſtore it. And this he might put in practice with ſo much the more freedom as he was more at liberty on the ſide of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> there being a ceſſation of Arms, and <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guieres</hi> repaſſed the <hi>Alps,</hi> in regard <hi>Bethune</hi> had the 9. of <hi>October</hi> made an agreement in <hi>Pavia</hi> with <hi>Toledo</hi> himſelf, that the Duke ſome time that month ſhould reſtore what he had taken, and diſband his Army, himſelf in <hi>November</hi> to render all, and diſpoſe of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my conformable to the Treaty of <hi>Aſti.</hi> Going then in perſon to <hi>Lodi,</hi> and ſending the Prince of <hi>Avellino</hi> to <hi>Caravaggio,</hi> he environs on all ſides the Territory of <hi>Crema,</hi> harraſſing the Country to the great prejudice of the Towns <hi>Camiſano</hi> and <hi>Volpino.</hi> To reſiſt them there went out of <hi>Crema</hi> 300 Horſe under <hi>Lodovico Vimercati</hi> with 200 Foot, which obliged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to leave their Booty; but they came near to <hi>Fara</hi> with a greater ſtrength in the <hi>Bergamaſco,</hi> where by a narrow Lane that Territory joyns to that of <hi>Crema.</hi> Two hundred men having the Guard in that place, of a weak incloſure, with a low Intrenchment, rendred themſelves to go out with their Swords after five hours fight. <hi>Romano,</hi> a great Town and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53750:63"/>
put it ſelf preſently into defence, <hi>Girolamo Cornaro</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor General coming thither with <hi>Franceſco Martinengo,</hi> under whom they joyned ſome Souldiers in pay, and ſome of the Country. <hi>Franceſco Erizzo</hi> came thither with title of Proveditor and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſario. But <hi>Toledo,</hi> to ſtraighten the Common-wealth the more, demanded paſſage of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to make a further inrode on that ſide, and publiſhed it was to bring a Garriſon into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiglione.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> complained highly that <hi>Toledo</hi> executed in ſuch manner the Capitulations of <hi>Aſti,</hi> which obliged him to free <hi>Italy</hi> from offences, jealouſies, and moleſtations; and that he ſhould no otherwiſe reſpect the Peace of <hi>Madrid,</hi> which ſuſpended warlike proceedings, and terminated Hoſtility, but with doing new miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and contriving greater vexations. They therefore endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtir up <hi>France</hi> with the contempt <hi>Toledo</hi> ſhewed of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, and with the obligation which engaged them to maintain to them the Treaty. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> after ſome perplexity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the deſire to recover <hi>Vercelli</hi> ſufficiently reſtrained him on the one ſide, and common faith and his own intereſt advertiſed him on the other of the dangers the Republick was in, offers to move im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in perſon; and recals the Troops, which having cauſed for the moſt part to paſs out of <hi>Italy,</hi> in order to the execution of the Peace, loitered under the Republicks pay in the Country <hi>de Vaux</hi> in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> to attend the iſſue of things. They ſtipulated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides at common charge a great Levy of <hi>French,</hi> and another with <hi>Mansfield</hi> to be raiſed in the Provinces of the Empire. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs theſe great preparations came preſently to nothing, becauſe <hi>la Queva</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> complying with the concluſion of the Peace, and giving word for the reſtitution of the Ships, Gallies, and Merchants goods, inſinuates in order to preſerve <hi>Gradiſca</hi> a general ſuſpenſion of Arms; and the Popes Nuntio, with the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> preſſing it alſo by their offices and intreaties, the Senate was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to order their General, that for <hi>Friuli, Iſtria,</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia</hi> he ſhould concert it with the <hi>Auſtrians;</hi> whereupon at a meeting upon the 7. of <hi>November</hi> of <hi>Pietro Barbarigo</hi> Procurator, and who was ſucceeded to <hi>Lando,</hi> who lay dangerouſly ſick, and <hi>Marradas,</hi> they adjuſted every thing, proportioning how much victuals ſhould every day enter into <hi>Gradiſca. Toledo</hi> now having obtained his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, publiſhed on his ſide the Peace, and ſome Troops being licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly run abroad towards <hi>Romano,</hi> though repulſed by the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> with the death of twenty five of them, he puniſheth the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and leaving <hi>Fara</hi> withdraws his Army into the <hi>Milaneſe. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuna</hi> on the contrary was mad at the name of Peace, and giving out that he would invade the Gulph anew, invented two pretexts; the one unjuſt, from the coming over of the <hi>Holland</hi> Troops; the other falſe, that there was a Fort building at St. <hi>Croce.</hi> It was true, that <hi>Veniero</hi> was in that Port with twenty three ſmall Gallies, five great ones, nineteen Ships, and ſome armed Barks, with other leſſer Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, but without other deſign than to hinder the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleets en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53750:63"/>
if they ſhould attempt it, and divert the thoughts of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> who divulged that he would fortifie thereabouts ſome of the Rocks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to thoſe of <hi>Raguſa.</hi> The Souldiers, in truth, had done ſome hurt, not without the conſent of the Chiefs, to chaſtiſe the boaſting of that people, and the aſſiſtance given to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships. But thoſe of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> by reaſon of the ſmallneſs of their Country, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves loſt, when they were ſcarce touched, made grievous complaints againſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> to the <hi>Turks.</hi>

            <p>The Pope and the <hi>French</hi> interpoſed with <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> and it was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, that <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf by Letters under his own hand had ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly commanded him to be quiet, and to reſtore to the Republick the Ships and Goods. But he feigning in greater ſcorn obedience, and to be willing to deliver to <hi>Gaſparo Spinelli</hi> their Reſident the Ships, ſpeaking nothing of the Goods, but diſſipating them publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Miniſter would not receive them to the prejudice of the reſt. The Duke not ſtopping his turbulent thoughts here, ſends anew <hi>Franceſco Rivera</hi> with nineteen Men of War into the <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> diſcovering him towards St. <hi>Croce,</hi> ranging their Fleet in order, came near to them cannoning one another. But night now coming on, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships ſet their courſe towards the Coaſt of <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Veniero</hi> follows them ſo cloſe, ſo that in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome of the Ships were very near to thoſe of <hi>Spain.</hi> He with the incitements of honour animates all to the fight, and laboured to put the Fleet in order, ſomething confuſed by the ſailing in the night; but beſides ſhooting from far with the Cannon nothing was done, becauſe the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ships got into order with difficulty, and ſome of them not without blemiſh abandoning that Poſt which the General had aſſigned them, they came not to grapple; but a great ſtorm following thereupon, they were forced to leave the Enemy to contend againſt the Sea, the lighter Gallies ran towards <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and amongſt the Rocks of <hi>Meleda</hi> there periſhed five. The great ones with the Ships, the General himſelf being gone into the Gallion, <hi>Balbi</hi> followed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as far as <hi>Manfredonia;</hi> but by the ſame occaſion of the wind, which drove them upon the land, they were obliged to return to St. <hi>Croce.</hi> And <hi>Rivera</hi> ſtays ſome time in <hi>Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſi</hi> with his Ships ill enough handled.</p>
            <p>But if there were a ſtorm at Sea, the waves went not leſs high at Land about the execution of the Peace of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> for that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thune</hi> making a journey to <hi>Mantua</hi> to induce that Prince to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and reſtitution of Goods to St. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> and the others compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Treaty, found him totally averſe to it. The myſtery was quickly diſcovered; for the <hi>Venetians</hi> having alſo interpoſed with the project of a Marriage betwixt <hi>Leonora</hi> and <hi>Vittorio,</hi> to which, leſt he ſhould ally himſelf with the Siſter of <hi>Lewis,</hi> it was believed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would not gainſay; yet it appeared that the Governor of <hi>Milan</hi> kept <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to hard meat, ſtrictly impoſing upon him not to conſent at preſent with ſo much facility to <hi>France</hi> that which he had conſtantly heretofore denied to <hi>Spain.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Bethune</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:53750:64"/>
parts with this impreſſion, that <hi>Toledo</hi> did not like that there ſhould be an entire compoſure betwixt the two Dukes, to the end that by their diviſions he at his pleaſure might have a ſtone at his foot to ſtumble the Peace. And he was therein the more confirmed, when coming to <hi>Milan,</hi> the Governour would not reſt ſatisfied in the truth of <hi>Carlo</hi>'s diſarming, pretending, that though his Troops were diſcharged, yet they were entertained out of <hi>Italy</hi> to be at the Dukes diſpoſing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bethune</hi> extremely troubled a this proceeding, ſends him a proteſt in writing, charging him to be author of all the evils, which might arrive upon his ſo much niceneſs. But <hi>Toledo</hi> not conſidering offices or proteſts, ſtrengthened himſelf continually with new Troops, and therefore it was but fit for <hi>Carlo</hi> to imploy himſelf in making great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proviſions. St. <hi>Ja</hi> and <hi>Creſcentino</hi> were put in defence, and <hi>Piſcina</hi> being diſpatched again to <hi>Venice,</hi> there was propoſed an adjuſtment of a new conſort and defence. With ſuch ambiguity of mind and thoughts ends the year 1617. memorable for the War, for the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, for the Treaties which diſturbed rather than quieted <hi>Italy,</hi> and which out of it ſcattered alſo miſchievous ſeeds of new and greater calamities; for no ſooner had <hi>Padavino,</hi> a Miniſter for the Republick, appeared among the <hi>Griſons,</hi> but the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> ſends <hi>Mora</hi> with orders, not only to hinder the League with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but with Propoſitions to conclude one with the <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe. Gheffier</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Miniſter oppoſes himſelf to theſe dealings of <hi>Spain:</hi> but although the Orders of the Court divulged the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he as much oppoſed that of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> from which <hi>Caſati</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, taking encouragement, propoſes in the <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach</hi> a League hereditary for a perpetual defence with excluſion of paſſage to every body elſe, and a prohibition to <hi>Padavino</hi> not to proceed in his Negotiation, promiſing that done (to gain their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) the demoliſhing of the Fort <hi>Fuentes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſo far was this Propoſition from being approved, that a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Republick was rather univerſally deſired, and that to ſuch a degree, that for fear it ſhould be effected, the Miniſters of both Crowns conſpired anew to divert it, by dividing the affections of thoſe people, rendring jealous the Commons, turning ſome about, and bringing them all into confuſion. It was no hard matter to compaſs their end, conſidering the affections of that wavering peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; whereupon ſome made an Inſurrection in the <hi>Agnedina,</hi> and joyning with ſixty Muſquetiers of <hi>Coira,</hi> attempted to drive away <hi>Padavino</hi> by force. Thoſe of <hi>Toſana</hi> whither he retired took him into their protection, breaking a Bridge by which theſe armed men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him with great violence. But taking counſel from the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, they let that ſudden motion, as they had ſeen it at other times, vaniſh of it ſelf; whereupon he retires into the <hi>Valtellina</hi> to <hi>Morbegno;</hi> where neither being ſecure, by reaſon of Orders from thoſe of <hi>Coira</hi> not to let him remain there, he was obliged to return into the <hi>Bergamaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The year terminating ſo tempeſtuous, 1618. in conſequence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with little appearance of quiet. In <hi>Germany,</hi> the truth was, that the inclinations of <hi>Matthias</hi> without queſtion tended to Peace, whence although the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> to give all the honour to <hi>Spain,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired only that the Treaty of <hi>Madrid</hi> ſhould be approved, with the excluſion of that Writing ſtipulated in <hi>Paris;</hi> nevertheleſs the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> diſſenting from it both from decency, and the Warranty of the Treaty, the ratifications were ſolemnly exchanged in <hi>Vienna. Giorgio Juſtiniano,</hi> Ambaſſadour for the Republick with <hi>Matthias,</hi> was admitted to Audience with <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to whom in an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable diſcharge of his function, omitting paſt diffidences, he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the intentions of the Republick towards his Royal perſon and Family, inferring from the preſent accord and the mutual readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to execute it, preſaging of a laſting peace and felicity of their Subjects, who from the affections of their Princes receive the moſt benign or the moſt ſevere influences.</p>
               <p>The Emperour, together with the King, had both a mind to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Commiſſioners, for executing the accord, Pope <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Coſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi> the Grand Duke (but that ſerved chiefly for State, and rather, to have Mediators) Confidents to both Parties, if any difficulty ſhould come to ariſe. Whereupon, it being neceſſary that the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould meet upon the place, from the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> were ſent the Barons, <hi>Carlo d'Harach</hi> and <hi>Giacomo Elding,</hi> and from the Republick <hi>Girolamo Juſtiniano</hi> and <hi>Anthonio Priuli</hi> Cavalier, both Procurators of St. <hi>Marco.</hi> The Iſland of <hi>Veglia</hi> was choſen for the place of meeting, both for the conveniency of the place, and becauſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> even in that loved to keep up a ſeemlineſs, bringing them home into their own Country.

               </p>
               <p>All paſſed with ſomewhat greater length than was accorded, and it was cauſed by various accidents and the quality of the buſineſs, rather than by the will of the Parties; beſides, becauſe it behoved reciprocally to ſubſtitute new Commiſſioners, <hi>Elding</hi> of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> being dead, and of the <hi>Venetians</hi> in place of <hi>Giovanni Bembo</hi> Duke deceaſed (<hi>Nicholo Donato</hi> having poſſeſſed the place leſs than a month) <hi>Priuli</hi> was aſſumed into the Principality.

There ſucceeded as Commiſſioner <hi>Nicholo Contarini,</hi> and to <hi>Elding Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quardo</hi> Baron <hi>d'Ech;</hi> but being recalled a while after, the Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence reſted in <hi>Harach</hi> alone.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi</hi> agreed upon, they were baniſhed with their families, and threatnings of moſt ſevere puniſhments, if they ſhould dare to return. The Barks were burnt, and in them alſo was burnt the Name of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi,</hi> with which the Republick was rid of an unquietneſs which had vexed them for many years. The greateſt part of them were tranſported to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtot,</hi> and other Frontiers of the <hi>Turks</hi> further from the Sea; ſome of the boldeſt were received under the protection of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> and amongſt them <hi>Andrea Ferletich</hi> conveying away a Bark, made in his paſſage ſome pilfering upon the Iſland of <hi>Arbe,</hi> at which the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Commiſſioners highly moved, proteſted to ſuſpend the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the places they poſſeſſed, if againſt the offence viſible ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities were not made appear; whereupon <hi>Harach</hi> deſirous to make a ſpeedy end of the buſineſs, becauſe the Inſurrections in <hi>Bohemia</hi> required to haſte the Troops thither, not being able to get <hi>Ferle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tich</hi> into his hands, arreſts by way of Hoſtage the Wives of three of his Followers, and baniſhed them all with a ſentence of death, if they ever returned. With this and the reſtitution of the Cannon of the Gally of <hi>Veniero,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> delivering in exchange thoſe carried away from <hi>Scriſa,</hi> the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> having punctually perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the agreement, the Republick preſently delivered the places they held; though on the one ſide the ſtirs of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> which greatly ſtraightned the Empire and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſuggeſted a conjuncture to attempt advantages, and the proceedings of the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> pricked them ſharply forward to new reſentments and revenge: For <hi>Oſſuna</hi> was ſo far from ſhewing any inclinations to Peace, that rather denying the reſtitutions promiſed, and continuing ſecret contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and publick deſigns, if he covered the one with ſilence, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the other with oſtentation, and talked of nothing elſe; in his Government keeping no other rule but his own will and Capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio, the conduct he uſed was in all things moſt extravagant. To be ſubject to Reaſon and Law he held an unbecoming ſervitude, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Priviledge of the Church, trod under foot the Nobility,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53750:65"/>
carried himſelf inſolent tnwards all, and oppreſſing the Kingdom, inſulted without diſtinction over all the Princes of <hi>Italy.</hi> Howſoever his extravagances ſerving for a kind of excuſe and cover, he ſeemed at the bottom not only ſupported by the moſt ſecret counſels of <hi>Spain,</hi> but there was a talk of prolonging his Government for three years more. The Pope foreſaw that this troubleſom Spirit would over-turn again the Peace of <hi>Italy;</hi> inſiſts therefore with moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual offices that he would be quiet, reſtore the Prizes, and not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Gulph.</p>
               <p>But the Vice-King, all other excuſes failing, offered to execute every thing when the Republick ſhould diſcharge the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> He nevertheleſs at the very ſame time was providing himſelf with Ships in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> whereupon the Republick rather than ſuffer Laws to be impoſed upon them, from his provocations found themſelves conſtrained to provide by all means for their own defence. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters failed not to oppoſe themſelves to it, and therefore in <hi>England</hi> their Ambaſſadour imployed all means and art to perſwade the King to deny them leave to hire Ships, and to divert Commanders from agreeing with them, and in <hi>Holland</hi> no endeavours prevailing, they gave out threatnings, that ſo powerful a Squadron of their Men of War ſhould meet them in the Straight, that they muſt expoſe themſelves to a Battel whoſoever would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the paſsage. All which notwithſtanding, <hi>Pietro Contarini,</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour for the Republick with King <hi>James,</hi> obtained his conſent for as many as he pleaſed, and <hi>Chriſtophoro Suriano</hi> Reſident in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> provided twelve, fitted in all points, which, equally ſlighting the boaſting reports and the hazards of a Battel, ſet ſail for the <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atick,</hi> and their courage not degenerating from their deſign, ſix Gallions of <hi>Spain,</hi> with ten or twelve leſſer Veſſels facing them in the Straight, paſſed happily, forcing the Ships which offered to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to retire with ſome loſs to their own Coaſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet being augmented with ſo notable a Renfort, <hi>Oſſuna</hi> from the deſign of force turns his mind to negotiate with the <hi>Turk,</hi> on the one ſide ſtirring up thoſe of <hi>Raguſa</hi> to make great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the damage they had ſuffered, and inſinuating on the other by the means of <hi>Caeſar Gallo</hi> a Truce betwixt <hi>Spain</hi> and the Port. But the <hi>Ottomans</hi> hearkened not at all to it, involved in a War with <hi>Perſia,</hi> and not at quiet in their own Country; for after three months, <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> as ſimple and unfit, was by the <hi>Muffti,</hi> the <hi>Caimecan</hi> and the <hi>Chiſlar Aga,</hi> that had promoted him, being depoſed; and <hi>Oſman,</hi> eldeſt Son of <hi>Achmet</hi> deceaſed, aſſumed into the Government in ſo tender an age, that if the other had ſerved only for a ſhort Spectacle of Fortune, this as an image of weakneſs, was forced to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Authority of the Miniſters.</p>
               <p>The complaints therefore of the <hi>Raguſians</hi> had ſcarce any acceſs; and by two ſeveral <hi>Chiaus,</hi> ſent from the <hi>Port</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the aſſumption of two Emperours, and by the extraordinary Embaſſie of the Republick, committed to <hi>Franceſco Contarini</hi> Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier and Procurator to congratulate with <hi>Oſman,</hi> the ancient amity
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53750:66"/>
remained confirmed. Nevertheleſs <hi>Oſſuna</hi> boaſting, expreſſes in publick that he would attempt againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> raiſed Souldiers, joyned Squadrons, and preſſed the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to joyn their Gallies unto his. But every one underſtanding his intentions to trouble the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> denied him; except the Pope, who ſent them but with expreſs prohibition to the Commander not to enter into the Gulph. At <hi>Taranto</hi> he ſtops another Ship with Merchandize which was going to <hi>Venice;</hi> and although for that and other things the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters in <hi>Madrid</hi> affirmed to have ſent expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders both to abſtain and to render, he nevertheleſs equally deſpiſed the Commands of the King, and the reſpect to the Common-wealth. He kept his Ships at <hi>Brindiſi;</hi> publiſhed, that he would invade <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia,</hi> cauſed an armed Ship to make a courſe to <hi>Trieſte,</hi> and made the World believe that he deſigned the pillaging of <hi>Lazzaret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> of <hi>Spalato,</hi> where in an open place the Merchandizes, which come of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Country, are aired from the ſuſpicion of the plague, and that not ſo much to ſatiate himſelf with ſpoils, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit of the diſorder, in which he hoped to involve the <hi>Venetians,</hi> if to the Goods loſt upon the Sea, the Subjects of the <hi>Port</hi> ſhould joyn their complaints and loſſes of ſuch as were raviſhed out of the cuſtody, and, it may be ſaid, the very boſom of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. The Senate, weary of ſuch a vexation, orders its Captain General, that was ready with forty two Gallies, ſix Galleonaſſes, and ſix and thirty Ships, being ſuperiour in ſtrength, to ſcour the Sea, free it from armed Ships, and take as many as he could meet. He preſently comes before <hi>Brindiſi,</hi> and for a whole day invites the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to come out; but knowing themſelves too much over-matched, retired to the innermoſt part of the Port, where being covered by the Town, the Cittadel, and a Fort, they could not be forced. He then ſets his courſe longſt the ſhores of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and at laſt <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> ſome of his more ſecret deſign, as ſhall be ſaid hereafter, being vaniſhed, recals his Ships from the Gulph, keeping them in <hi>Naples,</hi> although he had order to ſend them towards <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Venetians</hi> took a great Ship of <hi>Raguſa,</hi> which laden with Salt, was going from <hi>Barletta</hi> to <hi>Trieſte,</hi> and burnt another of the ſame Nation, which run her ſelf aground under the Town of St. <hi>Catoldo.</hi> Out of <hi>Fortore</hi> they took another lading Corn for <hi>Naples.</hi> All this being followed with the interruption of Trade, and the grievous complaints of the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> who repreſented in <hi>Spain,</hi> that from that populous City was taken even their very nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it induced the Miniſters at <hi>Madrid</hi> to recal the buſineſs of the reſtitutions out of the hands of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> and refer it to the Cardinal <hi>Borgia,</hi> that with <hi>Girolamo Soranzo,</hi> Ambaſſadour for the Republick at <hi>Rome,</hi> it might more eaſily be made an end of. But they having not been able to do the leaſt thing but the Duke got ſome kind of notice of it, he interrupts the proceeding anew, giving to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Auditor, who was come to <hi>Naples</hi> for that purpoſe, ſuch an imperfect Inventary of the Goods found in the Ships, that the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53750:66"/>
would not receive it. But <hi>Santa Croce</hi> being arrived with the Gallies, the Viceroy put into conſultation what enterpriſe they ſhould undertake, and propoſed to enter again into the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> to deliver, as he ſaid, the Ports of that Kingdom from a Siege. But <hi>Santa Croce</hi> diſſenting, who inclined rather to ſome enterpriſe in <hi>Africk, Oſſuna</hi> deſigns to do it himſelf by ſending by Sea to <hi>Trieſte</hi> a great ſuccour of men to King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who by reaſon of the occurrences of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> had great need of them. This coming to the knowledge of the Republick, they command <hi>Juſtiniano</hi> their Ambaſſadour in <hi>Germany,</hi> that he ſhould roundly declare to that King himſelf, that they would not ſuffer the Juriſdiction of the Gulph to be violated, nor let Ships and armed men paſs under the eye of the Capital City; whereupon the King, who had need of the aſſiſtance, yet deſired not that the Peace with the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould be interrupted, repreſented ſeriouſly to <hi>Oſſuna</hi> the ſending of it ſome other way more ſafe, though more long. Nevertheleſs, the Republick with a great Fleet, reſolved to guard themſelves even from the ſame, and thoughts of the Duke, and obſerving in the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> a mind equally averſe to Peace, upon the arrival of <hi>Piſcina</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> they command <hi>Renieri Zeno,</hi> who after <hi>Anthonio Donato</hi> reſided Ambaſſadour at <hi>Turin,</hi> to ſtipulate new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtments with <hi>Carlo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> had heretofore in former occaſions contributed to the Duke more than two Millions in ready money; now they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him ninety thouſand Ducats a month, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> failing in the things agreed, it ſhould be needful to take Arms. The Duke on the other ſide ingages himſelf to make a diverſion with between fifteen and twenty thouſand Foot, and two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, if any moleſtation was offered to the Republick. This being put into writing with mutual promiſe not to make Peace or Treaty apart, was not at that time ſigned; but being concluded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word and faith of the Princes Contracters, the Publication was deferred as long as any ſhadow of hopes of Peace remained. Upon this opportunity the Republick and the Duke pointing out to the other Princes of that Country the horrid image of ſlavery which threatned them all, inſinuated the means to free themſelves from it by a general Union, a thing very eaſie, if toward common ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there was ſtirring in them a love equal to that exceſs of reſpect they ſhewed to the more powerful. The ſaid Princes were in truth little contented with the preſent ſtate of things, expecting from what part the hope of ſecurity and quiet would diſcover it ſelf; not any nevertheleſs had the courage to ſhew themſelves, and <hi>France</hi> it ſelf preferring Negotiation before a rupture ſent to <hi>Turin</hi> a new Ambaſſadour <hi>Monſieur de Modene,</hi> not without the envy of <hi>Bethune,</hi> that he might perſwade the Duke to diſband thoſe Troops kept on foot out of <hi>Italy;</hi> but he had no power to diſpoſe of them, becauſe being maintained by the pay of the Republick, it was fit to have their conſent for it. The endeavours then of the Crown were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the Senate, with a promiſe, to take away jealouſies of

powerful aſſiſtance, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould hereafter fail in the leaſt tittle.</p>
               <p>This difficulty then removed (for the <hi>Venetians</hi> conſented to it) the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours went to <hi>Milan</hi> to aſſure <hi>Toledo</hi> of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming, and he not being able to ſhew diſtruſt, becauſe they gave it him in writing, privily undermines the Treaty by ſecret Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to the Duke of great advantages, if he would ſeparate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and offered him over and above, except <hi>Caſale,</hi> which he deſired might be left to <hi>Spain,</hi> the reſt of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> provided he would not inſiſt to have <hi>Vercelli</hi> reſtored. All aimed at delays, and being not able to gain <hi>Savoy,</hi> he turns to <hi>Mantua,</hi> doing his utmoſt to perſwade that Duke not to be ſatisfied with the reſtitution of places, but to pretend recompence of dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and deny pardon to the Rebels. And this ſerving no leſs for his purpoſe, to the end to perſwade <hi>Carlo</hi> not to be too haſty in rendring, he lets it be divulged that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> being reſtored to the poſſeſſion of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> the <hi>Gonzaghi</hi> would give it to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in exchange for other Poſſeſſions. There was indeed ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject talked of, but never concluded, becauſe it neither pleaſed the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to deprive himſelf of ſo noble a Patrimony, nor would <hi>Italy</hi> have ſuffered it, having at laſt learnt it was better to reſiſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by Arms than by Treaty.</p>
               <p>All therefore ſerved for the Governours purpoſe, who not being able to overcome <hi>Carlo</hi> with his flatteries, endeavoured to provoke him with diſguſts, and for that end his Secretary <hi>Carone</hi> being then with the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, he cauſed him to be injoyned immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to depart. The Duke in effect was angry at it, and ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the withdrawing of his Garriſons out of the places poſſeſſed, which was at the inſtant ready to have been done, he calls preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadours, as if the Treaty had been bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. But they pacifying him, and diſſwading him not to make ſport for <hi>Toledo,</hi> who ſought nought but pretexts and difficulties, upon the 6. of <hi>April</hi> he reſtores ſeventy four Towns of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and retires out of <hi>Annone, Maſſarano,</hi> and every other place feudal, delivering the Priſoners to the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters. Of all which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, contrary to what he could have believed, being given to <hi>Toledo,</hi> the report was, that in a rage he brake out, ſaying, It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the Peace muſt at laſt be executed, ſince Heaven and Earth have fatally conſpired to have it ſo. He then releaſes his Priſoners, and reſtores St. <hi>Germano;</hi> but for <hi>Vercelli,</hi> it ſeemed that the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was a Labyrinth, notwithſtanding that from <hi>Spain,</hi> at the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, were arrived Orders and frequent Courriers to reſtore it, and that to diſapprove his proceedings, his remove from his Charge before his time was publiſhed, the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> being deſigned to ſucceed him: But nothing availed; for firſt alledging, that it was not agreeable to the honour of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy to render the place, while the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> were in <hi>Milan,</hi> as if it were to extort it with the force of threatnings and proteſts, afterwards pretending that the Town of <hi>Gareſio</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing

to St. <hi>Giorgio</hi> ſhould be reſtored by <hi>Carlo,</hi> taking away both the pretexts by the departure of the one, and the reſtitution of the other, <hi>Vercelli</hi> was notwithſtanding not rendred. At laſt the King of <hi>France</hi> giving it out, that if the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours did not boudge, he ſhould be conſtrained to go in perſon into <hi>Italy,</hi> they began ſlowly to carry away the Ammunition and the Arms; afterwards, to keep footing yet a while, he requires a new promiſe from <hi>Carlo</hi> not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> But the Miniſters of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they deſired no greater ſecurity, and againſt the liking and expectance of the Governour amply expreſſed it in writing. Amidſt the amazement, the World was in, to obſerve the proceedings of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi> and the actions of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> it quickly appeared that the deſigns of great men are like the ſprings of water, whoſe ſource is more hidden than their ſtreams.</p>
               <p>All had its riſe from the iſſue that was expected of a treacherous Plot, which <hi>la Queva,</hi> with participation of the fore-mentioned, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged in <hi>Venice,</hi> where having his Reſidence, he had ſerved not only as a Director to their Arms, but an Architect of Treacheries. There was neither deceit nor hoſtility, which either in private or publick he practiſed not, prying into every thing, he inſinuated himſelf into all; whoſoever reſiſted his corruptions, he laid execrable impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures to his charge; to him that yielded to them, he propoſed moſt damnable deſigns. He fomented among ſome Souldiers of <hi>Holland</hi> kept in the <hi>Lazaretti,</hi> a certain ſpecious Tumult, raiſed up againſt their Officers; he attempted to debauch many from the Colours and Service of the Republick, and to bring in others to practiſe Treaſons.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the chief of theſe, Oſſuna ſends a certain <hi>Jacques Piere,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man, of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and Pirate by profeſſion, a man of great courage, but bred up in evil, and capable of all ſorts of wickedneſs. This Fellow feigning to be unſatisfied with <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> declares he would be revenged of him, paſſing to the Service of the Republick, and was without difficulty received there with his Camarade called <hi>Langlad,</hi> that had ſkill in Fire-works; although <hi>Simeon Contarini</hi> Ambaſſador then at <hi>Rome,</hi> a man of profound wiſdom, advertiſed, that there might poſſibly ſome treachery of the Viceroys be diſcovered. But <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> to take away all doubt, ſhewing to be angry, cauſed the Wife of <hi>Piere</hi> to be detained, and with feigned Letters propounding to him great rewards, recals him to his ſervice. He on the other ſide, to make himſelf acceptable at <hi>Venice,</hi> ſhews the Letters themſelves, propoſes many ſpecious things, feigns to diſcover the Viceroys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and ſuggeſts the means to oppoſe them. Having by this means gotten himſelf into great truſt, he was admitted with <hi>Langlad</hi> into the Arſenal to exerciſe his Art. He had afterwards ſecret meetings with <hi>la Queva,</hi> and there continually paſſed ſecretly Courriers and Spies to <hi>Naples.</hi> They had drawn into their wicked intentions <hi>Nic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colo Rinaldi, Carlo,</hi> and <hi>Giovanni Boleo, Lorenzo Nola, Roberto Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lido, Vincenzo Roberti,</hi> Captain <hi>Tornon,</hi> who had then a Company in ſervice of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and ſome others partly <hi>Burguignons,</hi> and the reſt <hi>French.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:53750:68"/>The contrivance was, that under an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, called <hi>Haillot, Oſſuna</hi> ſhould ſend certain Brigantines and Barks capable to enter into the Ports and Chanels, of which they had every where taken the ſoundings; greater Veſſels were afterwards to follow, and caſt Anchor on the ſhore of <hi>Friuli,</hi> under the countenance of which, and in the confuſion, which the firſt were to make among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Conſpirators had their parts divided; <hi>Langlad</hi> to give fire to the Arſenal, others in ſeveral parts of the City, ſome to Pettard the Mint, to poſſeſs the principal Poſts, kill the moſt conſiderable perſons, whoſe houſes were now marked with private tokens, hoping all to inrich themſelves with rich and unwonted pillage. Some things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were not eaſie to be put in execution; but wickedneſs and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice blinded them, with the imagination, that every ſtrange fancy was not difficult. At the ſame time <hi>Toledo</hi> having corrupted in <hi>Crema Giovanni Berardo,</hi> Lieutenant of a <hi>French</hi> Company, and ſome of his gang, held a correſpondence with him, receiving Letters and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to ſurpriſe the place, for which end he had ſent Souldiers to <hi>Lodi:</hi> But God with a Miſt fruſtrates ſuch wicked deſigns. Whilſt the Brigantines were in a readineſs to joyn together, expected by the Conſpirators with ſuch impatience, that every day they went up to the top of the highſt Steeples to diſcover them, ſome were taken by piratical Pinnaces, others diſperſed with a great ſtorm; ſo that being not able to get together again within the time appointed, they agreed to defer the execution till Autumn. <hi>Piere</hi> and <hi>Langlad</hi> commanded to go out with the Fleet, could not avoid going with <hi>Barbarigo</hi> the Captain General. The reſt remaining in <hi>Venice,</hi> cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to ruminate on the means of execution, impatiently expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time. But diſcourſing frequently of it amongſt themſelves, and to increaſe the number of their Complices, the confidence and ſecret coming to the knowledge of ſome others of their Nations (trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery being ſeldom ſo blind or ſo deaf that it hath not ſome light, and rumours;) <hi>Gabriel Montecaſſino</hi> and <hi>Baldaſar juuen</hi> Gentlemen, the one of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the other of <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> and nearly allied to <hi>Dediguieres,</hi> abhorring ſuch wicked counſels, diſcovered them to the Counſel of Ten. Being afterwards made more evident by the means of others ſecretly placed to hear, undiſcovered, their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and diſcourſes; ſome of the Conſpirators being impriſoned, the Treaſon was confirmed both by Letters found about them, and the confeſſion of the guilty, who ſatisfied the penalty both with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and ſecret puniſhment. Some nevertheleſs, frighted with the arreſt of their Companions, ſaved themſelves by flight, betaking themſelves to their Sanctuary, which was no other but <hi>Oſſuna.</hi> But <hi>Piere</hi> and <hi>Langlad,</hi> by an Order ſent with diligence to the Captain General, were drowned in the Sea, and in <hi>Crema, Berardo</hi> with his other Complices ended their lives ignominouſly under the Hangman. The City dreadfully frighted at the diſcovery of ſuch a Conſpiracy, and at the danger they had run to have ſeen the Churches and houſes burning, and the ſeat of the liberty and beauty of <hi>Italy</hi> inwrapt in a moment with ſword, fire, and a miſerable deſtruction; by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

of the Senate prayers and devout thanks were given to God. But <hi>la Queva,</hi> who was accounted the Director and Miniſter of ſuch wicked deſigns, was in great danger to have been from the fury of the people ſacrificed to the publick rage, reſolved to retire ſecretly to <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Senate already by an expreſs Courrier, had reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely required of the King to remove him. Princes being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed in ſuch occaſions to be pleaſed with the effects rather than the means, in <hi>Madrid</hi> the actions of this Miniſter were diſapproved, and to make it certainly appear, anſwer was given to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambaſſadour, that <hi>Luigi Bravo</hi> was already deſigned to ſucceed him, and he to paſs into <hi>Flanders</hi> to be aſſiſtant to the Archduke <hi>Albert. Oſſuna</hi> denies to have had any hand in it; for when the event of ſuch execrable practices is not ſuch, that for advantage, or for the ingenuity, is wont to make it commendable, there remains nothing but the abominable image of ignominy, rejected and deteſted of the Authors themſelves. The World nevertheleſs condemned him for guilty, whilſt the Fugitives, it was evident, had their refuge with him; and the Widow of <hi>Piere</hi> ſet at liberty, was ſent to <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> with an honourable Convoy. All this falling out at the time that the Peace was ready to be executed, the Senate was willing deeply to diſſemble it, having reſpect to the honour of the two Nations defiled, the one with Treachery, and the other with Venality, by the occaſion of a few wicked Villains, which being execrated of good men, would be rejected even by Nature her ſelf, if ſhe could as well revenge her ſelf of a wicked man, as it is neceſſary to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him no leſs than the good.</p>
               <p>Unto this diſcovery, and the ſtirs in <hi>Bohemia, Italy</hi> was believed obliged for their Peace; for now were the Ships of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> and <hi>Vercelli</hi> was reſtored to <hi>Savoy.</hi> A little while after <hi>Feria,</hi> being arrived at <hi>Milan,</hi> ſet his hand to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and to diſband the Troops, deferred by <hi>Toledo</hi> upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, that the Republick was armed, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with an extraordinary Militia. It only remained that the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſhould pardon his Rebels, and nothing elſe hindred his aſſent, but the delay of the approbation from <hi>Madrid;</hi> whereupon the Miniſters of <hi>France,</hi> who deſired to reap the glory alone, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed him a certain time, not without proteſts, within which <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> with the good liking of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhould grant the pardon. And thus one part of the unhappy Tragedy of <hi>Italy</hi> was at an end, there remaining amongſt the Princes, as after a great tempeſt at Sea, agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of jealouſies and diſtruſt, which quickly returned to new Wars and diſcords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo</hi> could not quiet himſelf from the jealouſies he had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nor ceaſe from thoſe thoughts, which kept him always intent upon novelty and his own advancement. On the other ſide, the Council of <hi>France</hi> tended to keep him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in bounds, not only to keep alive, through a confidence with him, the Party in <hi>Italy;</hi> but alſo to oblige him in ſuch ſort, that he ſhould not give countenance to the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> in the thoughts which
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53750:69"/>
                  <hi>Luines</hi> had to take out of their hands the places, wherein having been eſtabliſhed in the time of the Minority, rendred that Sect equal to the Royal Authority, if not ſuperiour. The Marriage therefore, upon the going of the Prince Cardinal <hi>Maurice</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded of <hi>Chriſtine,</hi> Siſter to the King, with <hi>Vittorio Amadeo,</hi> Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> nowithſtanding that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with much money, ſcattered amongſt their Partiſans in the Court, had endeavoured to hinder it. The deſign nowithſtanding againſt the <hi>Hugonots</hi> was for a while deferred, becauſe ſome diſturbance riſing in the Kingdom, <hi>Luines</hi> having not ſo ſuddenly been able to reſolve, whether to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the Queen-mother from her Confinement, or <hi>Conde</hi> from his Priſon, was moſt for his intereſt. Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Eſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> a man of an inflexible ſpirit, habituated formerly in favour, an object rather than a party in the flatteries of Court, receiving diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, becauſe in the Council the precedence of the Keeper of the Seal had been decided againſt him, and in the nomination to a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Cap, <hi>Gondi</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> had been preferred before his own Son, retires to his Government of <hi>Metz;</hi> where communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting counſels with the Mareſchal of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> he enters into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to take away the Queen from <hi>Blois,</hi> which he ſecretly effected, bringing her firſt to <hi>Lochies,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Angouleſme.</hi> The King came to <hi>Tours,</hi> and the Kingdom was every where in Arms; when the Biſhop of <hi>Luſſon,</hi> whom <hi>Luines</hi> ſecretly gave leave to quit <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> having a more than ordinary aſcendant upon the mind of the Queen, concluded an agreement, in which, with the pardon of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernon</hi> and his Followers, was promiſed to the Queen her ſelf the Government of <hi>Anjou,</hi> with that of <hi>Angiers, Chinon,</hi> and <hi>Pont de Cé.</hi> But <hi>de Luines,</hi> not wholly relying upon this new-made friendſhip, takes <hi>Conde</hi> out of Priſon, and enters into familiarity with him; which cauſing ſuſpicion in the other Party, he both purſues new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences and Levies of Arms.</p>

            <p>THE calm and quiet of the reſt of <hi>Europe</hi> had till now rendred more conſiderable the ſucceſſes of the Wars in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Treaties worthy of greater obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but mens minds began alſo elſewhere to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted, for War creeping like a Cancer, corrupted all the parts of Chriſtendom with mutations of States, alterations of things, memorable Sieges, great Battels, Actions famous, though ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often unjuſt, with ſo much ſlaughter of People, and calamity of Countries, that the preſent time might juſtly be called the Age of Iron and Blood. The beginning of ſuch grievous miſchiefs brake forth in <hi>Bohemia</hi> with the commotion of the Kingdom, which was believed the cauſe, and no leſs warranty of the Peace of <hi>Italy.</hi> It will not therefore be beſides the purpoſe to deduce the motives and ſucceſſes of it, becauſe no otherwiſe than in the Conjunction of the greater Planets, upon whom the moſt notable Effects depend, the influences of the one alter the diſpoſitions of the other; ſo in the affairs and linked intereſts of Princes, the accidents, whether good or bad, of the one part, are felt to be weighty in the other. King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> did now appear adopted by Fortune to the hope and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Empire, becauſe the Line of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second, though numerous, having no Heirs, the Maſculine Iſſue failing, the Dominions devolved to the other Line of <hi>Carlo,</hi> that was his Brother; upon which Right <hi>Ferdinand</hi> having already received the Crown of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53750:70"/>
               <hi>Bohemia,</hi> that of <hi>Hungary</hi> was now to be joyned to it to make way for him to the Imperial alſo, and in his perſon to unite the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and States of the whole Houſe in <hi>Germany.</hi> But there wanted not oppoſitions and difficulties; jealouſies awakening in the ſtranger Neighbours through the apprehenſion of ſo great a Potency, and doubt creeping into the hearts of the <hi>Germans</hi> themſelves to fall at length under the yoke of a baſe ſlavery, if the Empire ſhould be perpetuated in the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> and in particular if they ſhould confer it on <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in whom the power of all the hereditary Provinces, coming to be united, they did believe, they ſhould ſtrengthen for ever after that Chain, with which for a good while already they had found themſelves begirt.</p>
            <p>To the Policy of Princes, and to the Zeal of the People Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equally ſerved for a pretext and motive; becauſe <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> brought up in the Catholick Faith, deteſted all ſorts of errour, and therefore by how much, not ſucceeding to his Father, he found the Patrimonial Countries incumbred with falſe opinions, ſo much the more with ſignal piety had he applied himſelf to promote the true Worſhip, with ſuch ſucceſs, that at laſt thoſe Provinces rejoyced to be reſtored to the boſom of the ancient Religion. But this was not effected without ſome ſort of ſeverity; ſo that many, not to leave their errours, conſtrained to abandon their Country and ſell their Eſtates, lived elſewhere in poverty and diſcontent; and others dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven away by force, and their Eſtates confiſcate, ſaw them, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rancour, poſſeſſed by new Maſters. In the Empire therefore, in which the Religion no leſs than the Genius loves liberty, there appeared great apprehenſions, that where <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſhould get the power, he would exerciſe the ſame reformation, and impoſe a yoke ſo much the more heavy, by how much ſtanding in need of money, and the Councils of <hi>Spain,</hi> he ſhould be governed by the Rules and Maxims of that Nation, ſo hateful to the <hi>Germans.</hi>

               <hi>Frederick</hi> Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> young in years, but of a high mind, troubled more than any other with thoſe thoughts, viſiting for that purpoſe the Electors, had diverted them from the Election of a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> remonſtrating, that if the ſucceſſion of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> were not interrupted now that the right Line failed, there would be no reaſon to hope for it when it ſhould fall to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who being upheld by foreign Force, and having Iſſue, would for ever eſtabliſh the Imperial Throne in himſelf and his poſterity. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, not thinking it an eaſie matter to gain the Empire for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or any of the Proteſtant Electors, he offered it to <hi>Maximilian</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> for whom concurring the Votes of the three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and a fourth of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cologne</hi> his Brother, the Election would be ſecure. But the Miniſters of the Pope and thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> oppoſed that Propoſition; and therefore, beſides private intereſts, ſtirred up thoſe of that Religion, which, the Empire go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> could not, wanting ſo ſtrong a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but extremely ſuffer. Great advantages being offered to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> not to accept the invitation, the proceeding vaniſhed, which
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53750:70"/>
notwithſtanding the Election of a King of the <hi>Romans</hi> was deferred.</p>
            <p>The Empire toſſed to and fro amidſt theſe Negotiations, <hi>Bohemia</hi> falls into commotion. In that Kingdom, as it is the higheſt part of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſo it hath always been the moſt eminent Theatre of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and of Hereſie, and their minds almoſt in all times have been divided into various Sects. That of the <hi>Communion under both Spe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cies</hi> exceeded any other, having riſen to that growth amidſt the paſt diſſentions of the Emperours <hi>Rudolphus</hi> and <hi>Matthias;</hi> who, to gain that ſort of people, had to ſtrives inlarged the liberty of Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Theſe Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences were commonly called Letters of the Royal Authority, ſo much the more tenaciouſly kept by the people, by how much leſs pleaſing to the Princes, who by an ambitious neceſſity had granted them. For this cauſe, if any doubt aroſe, they procured a reſtraint of them by judgments in favour of the Catholicks; and <hi>Matthias</hi> being no ſooner gone to hold a Diet in <hi>Hungary,</hi> but there came forth a certain Decree in favour of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Prague</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Bruno,</hi> who had oppoſed the building of two Temples for the Hereticks upon ground belonging to them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bohemians,</hi> free from the bridle, which the preſence of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces carries with it, aſſembled about this in <hi>Prague,</hi> and requiring a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Diet of the Kingdom, to bring their grievances thither, and to promote their advantages, whilſt <hi>Matthias,</hi> ſo counſelled by his chief Miniſters, denied and deferred it; they parted in a Rout from the Colledge <hi>Carolino</hi> the 23. of <hi>May</hi> in the morning, and coming to the Caſtle, and going into the quarter of the Chancery, and aſking for the Authors of ſuch a refuſal, finding the Counts <hi>Martinitz</hi> and <hi>Slavata</hi> with <hi>Philip Fabritius</hi> the Secretary, eſteemed the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Catholick Religion, they flung them out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. The miracle of the ſucceſs is convinced from the ſituation, the view whereof gives the lye to the imprudence of thoſe, who with falſe inventions have gone about to blemiſh it; becauſe to the place, from whence they fell, there joyning a Precipice of a dreadful height before you come to the earth, and being continued with a ſteep declining to the foot of the Wall, forming a moſt craggy Ditch for the Caſtle; all three of them falling right down, and certain ſhots of muſkets made after them, were taken up without hurt; only <hi>Slavata</hi> lightly ſcratched by the reſiſtance he made; nevertheleſs he was able to ſave himſelf in a houſe adjoyning. <hi>Martinitz</hi> diſguiſed, went out of the City that very day, and the Secretary haſted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>Vienna</hi> to be the firſt ſhould bring the News. The Mutineers bethought themſelves, that, together with the chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they had precipitated peace, hopes, and pardon. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eaſily poſſeſſing and fortifying the Caſtle, the ordinary Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the King, they ſet themſelves to maintain by a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable force what they had begun with ſo great violence.</p>

               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:53750:71"/>The head of this commotion appeared to be <hi>Henry</hi> Count <hi>de la Tour,</hi> who to his private emulation to <hi>Martinitz</hi> (to whom had been granted the Government of <hi>Carleſtein,</hi> the place where the Crown of the Kingdom is kept, taken away by <hi>Matthias</hi> from <hi>la Tour,</hi> expreſly from the ſuſpicion of his haughty mind) conjoyned the publick concerns of his Religion rather than his own intereſts; for he, by occaſion of the ſame, having been driven by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> out of his Countries, with the loſs of his Goods, expected, when he ſhould come to the Crown of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to be uſed in the ſame kind. The people therefore being moved with crys of liberty, a name dear above all others, when it is not, as it often happens, from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and intereſt abuſed; and calling together the chief of them to a particular Conference, he thus ſpake: <hi>I call you not hither to yield me your obedience or your oaths, neither do I aſpire to the Crown or Scepter of this unhappy Kingdom; but ready to run equal hazards with you, I invite you to be Companions in your own liberty. I ſee, by your ſilence, amazement united to the aſſent; and not without reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this unexpected light, which Heaven here opens amidſt the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to which we are accuſtomed, comforts together and dazles. Let us now begin to enjoy life and liberty, the Soul it ſelf. Where are the moſt worthy Priviledges of the Kingdom of</hi> Bohemia? <hi>Where is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent Authority of this unconquered People? Where is the exerciſe of Religion ſo many times ſworn to God? forbid that Conſcience, that rare gift from Heaven, ſhould depend upon the will and promiſes of Princes! This uſurped Crown paſſes from head to head, as the Revenue and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of one Houſe; and to eſtabliſh an everlaſting Tyranny, being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed before its time from Succeſſors, in ſpite of death, is never ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be vacant. Is not Dominion without peradventure the peoples Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and the Dowry of the Common wealth; and yet the</hi> Auſtrians <hi>without our conſent have arrogated it to themſelves? What have we not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſuffered? The uſe of life comes now to be denied us, and the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruit of the ſoul conteſted; but all our paſt miſeries will not be able to call to your remembrance but ſome imperfect repreſentative of the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to come. In ſum,</hi> Rudolphus <hi>lived amongst us;</hi> Matthias <hi>hath reaped us as the firſt fruit of his ambitious deſires; but what may we expect from</hi> Ferdinand, <hi>unknown to us, and in himſelf rigorous, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Counſels of</hi> Spain, <hi>and governed by that ſort of Religious Prieſts and people, who deteſt with an equal averſion our Liberty and our Belief? He hath been born and bred up in the abhorrency of us Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and why ſhould we be forward to make tryal of it, if the perſons baniſhed, the Families diſplanted, the Goods violently taken away, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate too cruelly to us, that he would aboliſh our very being, if he could as eaſily command Nature as he uſes force? Wo to you,</hi> Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, <hi>to your Children, to your Eſtates, to your Conſciences, if you ſuffer</hi> Ferdinand <hi>to keep his footing in the Throne. And when will you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſhake off the yoke, if you have not courage to do it at a time, when without power, without guard, the Kingdom is in your own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that you have two Kings to oppoſe you, one whereof is fallen, and the other totters? Aſſuredly you ſhall not be alone, but as many Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53750:71"/>
as you have in your Religion, ſo many friends ſhall you have in Arms. All</hi> Europe <hi>will be moved, and you ſhall ſee in your favour in ſome riſe up the provocations of piety, and in others undiſtinguiſhed conſiderations of Religion and State. Such commotions are like the great Rivers, which riſing from very ſmall Springs increaſed by many, as they run, carry into the Sea the name of one, and the waters of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Look upon thoſe happy people of</hi> Holland, <hi>who with more zeal than fear undertaking their deliverance from Captivity, enjoy at preſent the famous ſtation of Liberty and Greatneſs. I dare aſſure you, that in all Ages the Generoſity of the</hi> Bohemians <hi>ſhall be memorable, that having flung tyrannical Government out of the windows, hath cauſed the glory to ſpring out, which from this Kingdom will eaſily diffuſe it ſelf to the Empire; and though ſome appearance of violence hath been in it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and piety will excuſe the fact. There is no more place for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or pardon, counſel or diſcourſe avails no more, but only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and conſtancy. The Lot is drawn, Liberty or the Hangman; if Conquerours, we ſhall be juſt, free, and Princes; if overcome, perfidious, perjured, and Rebels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little ſerved to ſtir mens minds, incenſed of themſelves to thoughts of Novelty; for if that flouriſhing Kingdom in its ſoil riſe as it were into War with fertile and almoſt continued Hills, the people are no leſs accuſtomed to float amidſt perpetual provocations of Religion and Liberty. It was then decreed to ſhake off the yoke by the conſent of all; and if there were any, that in their minds were againſt it, yet knowing they were not able to reſiſt that univerſal violence, not to make themſelves ſuſpect, they made a ſhew to adhere to it with greater vehemence. To carry on the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, a Magiſtracy of Thirty with title of Directors was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. But what had happened at <hi>Prague,</hi> was no ſooner divulged through the Kingdom, but all was in revolt, drawing alſo the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of <hi>Luſatia</hi> and <hi>Sileſia,</hi> Provinces annexed. The advice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought at the Emperours Court, there was a great diviſion of opinions and counſels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matthias</hi> by plauſible means, letters, and perſwaſions, together with ſomething beſides of conceſſion, deſired to reduce the <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> to their obedience, and <hi>Gleſelius</hi> ſtrengthened him in that thought, out of the conſideration, that coming to Arms, the War was to be directed by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in which, if the authority of the one might be rendred ſuſpicious to the Emperour, the practices of the other would be no leſs troubleſom; againſt which, from the time when in his younger years he was carried to the Government of the rebel Provinces of <hi>Flanders,</hi> he had retained a certain aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in his mind. Nor was the Cardinal in his judgment a jot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> that inclined more, than to pleaſures, to the management of Arms, abetted by the counſels and favours of the Archduke <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and of the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> no ſooner ſaw the Emperour levy ſome few Souldiers for neceſſity, but he aſked the Command of them. <hi>Matthias,</hi> troubled to deny him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to grant it, but with ſuch reſtriction, that forming a Council
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53750:72"/>
of War of his Confidents, of which notwithſtanding the King ſhould be chief, and limiting the Authority, he left him no more than the ſhadow. All this was attributed to <hi>Gleſelius,</hi> to whom was imputed, beſides venality in affairs, little propenſion to the concord of the family and greatneſs of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> a connivence and ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant facility towards the Hereticks; accuſations which proceeded principally from the hatred conceived againſt him by the Miniſters of <hi>Spain;</hi> becauſe to his utmoſt keeping the King and Archduke, from the knowledge of the foreign affairs, he excluded them alſo from thoſe of the Empire; and in the affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> his inclination to Peace had carried him to oppoſe their deſigns. Amongſt the means ſtudiouſly thought on to take him out of the way, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared too ſacrilegious to ſtain the Purple of a Cardinal with blood, and in the City of <hi>Vienna</hi> to kill, as it were upon the Altar, Biſhop thereof.</p>
            <p>It was then reſolved to arreſt him Priſoner, not regarding the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and authority of <hi>Matthias,</hi> which were his only refuge, not without hope and deſign after the thing done, either to pacifie the Emperour by flatteries, or curb him with apprehenſions. So being one day called to a Council in the Archdukes Quarter, where the King was with <hi>Ognate,</hi> he was ſeized as he came in by <hi>D'Ampiere</hi> and <hi>Prainer,</hi> and put into a cloſe Coach with a hundred Horſe for a Guard, hurried apace toward <hi>Inſpruch.</hi> Although the Princes themſelves went to communicate it to <hi>Matthias</hi> with many pretexts of Religion, of connivence, advantage to the houſe, and of his own ſervice, it is not to be ſaid, how much he was moved at it; becauſe touched in the apple of the eye of his authority and affection, it drove him to the extremity of paſſion; nor could he withhold him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, both when awake, and in his dreams from crying out with a loud voice, that <hi>Gleſelius</hi> ſhould be brought back to him again. There was an opinion, that he had ſome thoughts to caſt himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the arms of the mutined <hi>Bohemians</hi> for revenge. But the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Dietrichſtein,</hi> a perſon of very great credit, did in ſome manner pacifie him, bringing into his Chamber the King and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke to aſk pardon for the tranſport, with proteſtations not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude themſelves into his Authority or Government.</p>
            <p>The Emperour required that promiſe in writing; but it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that he ſhould be contented with the word only; and the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while he lived, he paſſed in continual apprehenſions and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, not without calling to mind Divine Judgments, which to him from his Couſin retributed the ſpoil of that Authority, which he but a few years before had with great violence extorted from his Brother <hi>Rudolphus.</hi> And it in truth ſeems that the impriſonment of <hi>Gleſelius</hi> had ſet wide open the Sepulchres of the <hi>Auſtrians;</hi> for <hi>Anna</hi> the Empreſs and <hi>Maximilian</hi> dyed preſently after, and were ſoon followed by others. The Priſoner was found to have neither money nor goods, and that abſolved him from the common report of corruption and avarice, he being diſcovered to be poor, who under the benign influence of the favour of the Prince it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53750:72"/>
had enjoyed Mines and Treaſures. He was at laſt put into the Popes hands, who exclaimed that the Dignity and Priviledge of the Church was violated, to the end that he might judge him for the faults committed, being mixt of Religion and State. But after a year or two being reſtored to his liberty, he lived quietly as he had been known to be innocent. During theſe preſent domeſtick contentions of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> the <hi>Bohemians</hi> had made great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of that time in furniſhing themſelves with arms, money, and friends. Amongſt the firſt that ingaged in this troubled affair was <hi>Erneſt,</hi> Count of <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> natural Son of <hi>Peter Erneſt,</hi> as famous for the miſchiefs done with ſmall Forces, and the height of courage for the ſpace of many years to the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> as the Father had been remarkable in the Government of the Low-Countries, and ſeveral other imployments for his fidelity to <hi>Spain.</hi> He being of an ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirit, deſiring by notable actions to make good to the World his ſpurious birth, after having paſſed through many Charges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> renouncing the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, made it his ambition to cloſe with Fortune in the greateſt dangers. He was at that time in <hi>Piedmont</hi> in ſervice of the Duke, who, placing the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſecurity of his own quiet in the diſturbances riſen in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> gave him leave to raiſe 2000 Souldiers, and paid them for him for certain months, that he might carry them to the <hi>Bohemians. Carlo</hi> over and above exhorts the <hi>Venetians</hi> to contribute to that cauſe ſome ſecret aſſiſtance; but the Republick did not believe that it was fit for them to ingage themſelves further than in their own defence, and in the common Liberty of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mansfelt</hi> was gladly entertained by the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and honoured with the Charge of General of the Artillery, he with <hi>la Tour</hi> became the chief Parties in the Revolt, which, to ſay truth, could not be more furiouſly conducted than by thoſe two Chiefs, one of which paſſed for deſperate, and the other for one of a moſt turbulent ſpirit. <hi>Mansfelt</hi> preſently poſſeſſes himſelf of the Town of <hi>Pilſen,</hi> and there remained now no other of conſideration for the Emperor but <hi>Buduais,</hi> where <hi>Carlo</hi> Count of <hi>Buquoy</hi> raiſed ſome Troops.</p>
            <p>Such was the <hi>Praeludium</hi> of ſo many other calamities, which have ſince involved <hi>Germany</hi> in many miſeries, which were too much threatned her by a fierce Comet, which about the end of the year appeared towards the North. And if it be true, that at ſome great <hi>Criſis</hi> Nature it ſelf is moved, the fall of a Mountain, which burning a whole People alive overwhelmed <hi>Plurs,</hi> the greateſt City of thoſe parts, might be reckoned as a prodigious Prognoſtick of the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Rhetia.</hi> And, to ſay truth, both for the buſineſs and the Arms the affairs of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and the <hi>Griſons</hi> had a ſufficient reſemblance; becauſe that in this very year the minds of that people continued ſtirred and implacably diſordered. It happened, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> having publiſhed, and by the means of <hi>Anthonio Antelmi</hi> ſolemnly ſworn the Alliance formerly concluded with the Cantons of <hi>Zurich</hi> and <hi>Bern,</hi> the agreement in conſequence was, that in order to the Union of the three Leagues with the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> the paſſages ſhould
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53750:73"/>
be open for them; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> oppoſed it with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that ſome certain Horſe, raiſed under pay of the Republick by Colonel <hi>Sciavaleſchi,</hi> were obliged to make a ſtand, finding that the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> themſelves kept their own Guards upon the paſſes, doubting leſt connivence or the venality of thoſe of that Country ſhould let them through. To this buſineſs being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards added fear and force, <hi>Feria</hi> the new Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> to incommodate <hi>Rhetia,</hi> and ſtir their minds, ſtopped the paſſage of Merchandize; and <hi>Gheffier</hi> obſerving, though there was no Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the <hi>Venetians</hi> in thoſe parts, that in the <hi>Agnedina</hi> the Election of a <hi>Miniſtrat</hi> (who is a temporary Head of their Government) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome conteſts with the ſhedding of blood, was fallen upon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that Faction, preſented a certain Writing, in which feigning to controul the Treaties of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſtruck more to the quick upon thoſe of the Republick, propoſing that all other Alliances might be caſt off, except that with <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Propoſition pleaſed not the Commons, and ſo much the leſs, by how much the Creditors of many Penſions from the Crown re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring payment of them, he offered to ſatisfie only one of them, which was refuſed by the people with inſufferable ſcorn. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs their minds were generally wavering, becauſe the chief a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them making Merchandize to their own profit of the publick evils, made themſelves powerful with adhering to Strangers; and the poorer ſort vexed with this corruption and the ſeverity of their judgments, did not willingly bear the yoke. For which cauſe, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Arms on a ſudden in ſeveral places, they furiouſly ranſacked the Country, not knowing who was to be their enemy and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of their own deſigns. At <hi>Zernez</hi> they obliged <hi>Rudolpho Pianta</hi> to run away, who with his Brother <hi>Pompeo,</hi> declared Partiſans of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> rendred themſelves under that protection even as odious to all as feared by many; and to him it was principally imputed to have been one of the ſowers of diſcord: ſo that they would have put him to a cruel death, if he had not made his eſcape by flight. They run then to <hi>Coira,</hi> whence <hi>Gheffier,</hi> who by his proceedings was not diſtinguiſhed from a Miniſter of <hi>Spain,</hi> reſolved to retire in haſte to <hi>Maianfelt;</hi> and as if the fury of the people had been ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any order or diſcipline, they deliberated to eſtabliſh a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal in <hi>Toſana,</hi> compoſed of Judges Catholick and Proteſtants, who ſhould proceed againſt thoſe who ſhould have ſold to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the weak of the Country.</p>
            <p>Under this cenſure many principal men periſhed; <hi>Giovanni Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta Zambra</hi> by the hand of the Hangman; <hi>Niccolo Ruſca</hi> the Chief Prieſt of <hi>Sondrio</hi> dyed under Tortures; the <hi>Pianta's</hi> were baniſhed upon grievous puniſhments, and <hi>Giovanni</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Coira;</hi> the City it ſelf being fined in the ſum of 15000 Crowns. <hi>Molina,</hi> Interpreter of <hi>France,</hi> Native of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> was in like ſort baniſhed, and to <hi>Ghef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier</hi> was intimated the leaving his imployment; but he hoping that good order would be ſo much the leſs durable amongſt that people by how much they wearied themſelves to introduce it, took time
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53750:73"/>
to give advice of it to the Court,<label type="milestone">

There being alſo for the ſame cauſe of the <hi>Griſons</hi> ſome diſſention riſen in ſome Cantons of the <hi>Switzers;</hi> to quiet it, as is the cuſtom, rather with conference than force, a Diet was called in <hi>Baden;</hi> where <hi>Gheffier</hi> appearing, taxed the <hi>Venetians</hi> to have fomented this laſt revolution, in which there appeared many of their party.

               <p>Many ſollicited the <hi>Venetians</hi> to ſend a Miniſter, to conclude a League quickly during the predominancy of thoſe moſt inclined to their Party; but they willing to obſerve the iſſue of ſo ſtrange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, not to confound things rather than contribute to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, forbore it. It quickly was made manifeſt, that the people in their affection had but a ſhort ſpace betwixt their flood and ebb; for they preſently fell back into the contrary party. <hi>Gheffier</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſter, conſpiring by concert to ſtir up a new Revolt, with money and other endeavours raiſed ſome of the Commons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext to aboliſh the new erected Courts of Juſtice, and to reſtore the Biſhop. About <hi>Coira</hi> there happened betwixt the Parties a bloody Encounter, and according to the reciprocation of force, ſometimes making faulty, and ſometimes giving authority; another Tribunal was erected in that Town, which aboliſhed the acts of that of <hi>Toſana,</hi> called back the baniſhed, and puniſhed the Judges themſelves.</p>
               <p>The oppreſſed had recourſe to the <hi>Venetians;</hi> but inſtead of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance they received Councils for a ſincere reconciliation; for in effect, in that confuſion of affairs, they knew not how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign any advantage, and foreſaw, that the moſt powerful at laſt would reap the benefit. Nevertheleſs in the <hi>Agnedina</hi> the tumult began of its own accord, and taking Arms, ſpread it ſelf through all
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53750:74"/>
the Country with ſo much violence, that the new Judges fled from <hi>Coira,</hi> and thoſe formerly baniſhed abſented themſelves anew. In <hi>Cicer,</hi> twenty nine Enſigns being aſſembled, they eſtabliſhed a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of ſixty ſix perſons, who taking a review of things paſt, were to act in ſuch ſort, that <hi>Gheffier</hi> ſhould not ſtay in <hi>Rhetia.</hi> All that had been decreed by the Judicatory of <hi>Toſana</hi> was authorized by this, and what had been acted to the contrary made void. It was enough for <hi>Feria,</hi> Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> to have put the Country into confuſion, content at preſent to foment the diſorder under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and whilſt all the Miniſters of the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> were aſſembled upon the occurrences of the Empire, to apply himſelf to what in their abſence at this time happened. <hi>Matthias</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, after a long ſickneſs of mind, no leſs than of body, expiring in the month of <hi>March,</hi> left, for the Election of a Succeſſor, minds divided, according to the difference in Religion. The Catholicks, animated by the Offices of the Pope, and upheld by the promiſes of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> inclined to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as one who being taken notice of for piety, might alſo be able with puiſſant Forces to maintain the Dignity and Religion. On the other ſide it hath been ſaid, how much the Proteſtants abhorred him. Whereupon the <hi>Palatine</hi> laboured all he could, that the Diet might be deferred, the better to concert his excluſion; and the others were willing enough to obſerve the iſſue of the preſent Revolts, taking for pretext, that the ſtirs in <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia</hi> ought firſt to be quieted, and afterwards in the general calm of the Empire choice made of a Head to the ſatisfaction of all. But the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> to whom, as Chancellor of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Charge belongs, proclaims a Diet at <hi>Francfort,</hi> and at laſt the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors appeared there, either in perſon, or by their Deputies; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to hinder it, there were ſome that infeſted the High-ways, and kept them in a manner beſieged.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> rejecting the Letters, by which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> offered clemency, pardon, confirmation of Priviledges, with Liberty of Conſcience, and all that which they could pretend, ſtir up thoſe that were far and near. Upper <hi>Auſtria</hi> unites with the Rebels, a few Catholicks in vain contradicting, and declare to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by themſelves, till it ſhould be decided, who ought lawfully to ſucceed, pretending it did belong to <hi>Albert,</hi> Brother of the Emperour deceaſed, notwithſtanding his renouncing to it in favour of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi> And the Lower would not have acted otherwiſe, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Vienna,</hi> which was peſtered with Hereſie, if <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> being then there, had not with his authority and preſence withheld it.

The General only (who was that <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Walleſtain,</hi> who by that act of fidelity gave beginning to that great Fortune, which in a few

years carried him to an Aſcendant, and afterwards to a Precipice, went on to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> delivering a certain ſum of money he had in his poſſeſſion for the payment of his Souldiers; but the <hi>Moravians</hi> had a mind to fetch it again by force, detaining, till it was reſtored, in arreſt the Cardinal <hi>Dietrichſtein,</hi> a faithful Servant to the King, who believing himſelf more in want of faithful Counſellors than money, although he was in great neceſſity, for his liberty readily reſtores it. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> by all this was at the very brink of paſſing to the ſucceſſion, and the Empire in a calamitous condition, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed even to the extremity of dangers; for <hi>la Tour,</hi> ſollicited by ſome Barons of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> came near to the <hi>Danube,</hi> and being furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Boats by thoſe of his Party, paſſed it to the terrour of the Country, and of the City of <hi>Vienna,</hi> having as it were no Garriſon but the preſence and conſtancy of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> whilſt the Souldiers within it exceeded not 1500 Foot, and 200 Horſe, who were to guard it from the Inhabitants, no leſs than from Enemies, becauſe they held Correſpondence with <hi>la Tour,</hi> and had treated to deliver him a Port. But he having lain ſtill two days at <hi>Fiſchen,</hi> loſt the Victory; becauſe, believing to conquer a City, by the ſame manner he had made whole Provinces revolt with Letters and invitations, he wrote to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and while he expected an anſwer, the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity armed five hundred Scholars; Victuals were brought in, and ſome Souldiers arrived. Moſt opportunely of all came the ſuccours of certain Companies of Cuiraſſiers, ſent by the great Duke of <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany</hi> to his Kinſman, which by the addreſs of one <hi>Santilier,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Gentleman, falſifying their Colours, entred, paſſing through the midſt of the <hi>Bohemiſh</hi> Squadrons into <hi>Vienna,</hi> in that very inſtant that the King was hard put to it by ſome, who inſolently plucking him by the Doublet, required the Conceſſion of Priviledges and Liberty of Conſcience. But hearing the trampling of the Horſes, and unexpectedly ſeeing the Souldiers run up and down the ſtreets with their Swords in their hands, the fright was ſo great amongſt them, that they diſperſed, and together with them the Conventicles were diſſolved, which they held in private houſes, wherein alſo ſtore of Arms were gathered together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>La Tour,</hi> to give courage to his, drew near to the City, and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Suburbs, beſieges it, but for a few days only; for <hi>D'Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre</hi> with 4000 men raiſed in <hi>Hungary,</hi> deſigning to joyn with <hi>Buquoy,</hi> who was ſtrong 1000 Cuiraſſiers, <hi>Mansfelt</hi> attempted to hinder him in his way; but <hi>Buquoy</hi> fell upon him ſo opportunely out of an Ambuſcade, that he defeated him with a great number of ſlain, and more of Priſoners. Upon this advice <hi>la Tour</hi> draws off from <hi>Vienna,</hi> fearing leſt upon this diſgrace the <hi>Bohemians</hi> might be wavering. But Fortune carried <hi>Ferdinand</hi> from a Siege to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; for, fetching a long compaſs, and arriving at laſt at <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> he was received there with infinite applauſe, and the inſtances of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> being rejected, who endeavoured to exclude him, the oppoſitions of <hi>Saxony</hi> being overcome with recompences, and the <hi>Palatine</hi> at laſt forced to conſent, he was the 28. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53750:75"/>
with the Imperial Dignity, while at the ſame time the <hi>Bohemians</hi> reſolve upon a new Election of a King. Whether this Kingdom be Hereditary or Succeſſive, is a diſpute which hath long wearied Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Pens with various Judgments; ſome approving reaſon, though over-maſtered, others applauding the direction of Fortune, and the Conquerours. As to that which concerned this buſineſs in queſtion, the reſolution ſprung both from the neceſſity of having a Director of that confuſed Government, and from the want of a ſupport by foreign Force. In conſideration of his nearneſs, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and his Power, they offered the Crown to <hi>John George,</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony;</hi> but he, hoping for more certain advantages from the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians,</hi> refuſes it.</p>
               <p>The fame of worth and courage begot a great eſteem of <hi>Carlo Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> ſo that he was invited by the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> and in regard of their Religion and Liberty would have preferred him before all others; but it appearing environed with thorns that were too ſharp, neither <hi>Carlo</hi> nor any body elſe was yet found, that was willing to accept it. It was then adjudged to <hi>Frederick</hi> Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> a young man, and in whom concurred his own high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and the hopes to be aſſiſted by others, being Son-in-law to the King of <hi>England.</hi> It ſeemed to ſome of the more wary of that Party, that affairs were too far advanced, the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> being put to a neceſſity of putting forth their utmoſt ſtrength, and the Catholicks into the obligation of uniting themſelves with them. Therefore ſome of the Electors were not wanting, who diſſwaded the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; Bavaria</hi> counſelled from it, and the King of <hi>England</hi> himſelf endeavoured to divert him. He at firſt ſhewing himſelf backward, was at laſt ſeduced by hopes and ambition to deſpiſe their counſels. He had his chief incouragement from the then preſent ſtate of things; for although <hi>Ferdinand</hi> were advanced to ſo remarkable dignity, his ruine was thought near hand; whilſt, being got free from many trains, which in his return from <hi>Francfort</hi> were laid in the way, he no ſooner arrives at <hi>Vienna</hi> but he ſees all <hi>Hungary</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in Arms.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> having applied themſelves to the <hi>Ottoman Port,</hi> to get a conſent that <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> might raiſe Souldiers in thoſe parts, where many Hereticks of the Country mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to it, had no great difficulty to obtain it, the <hi>Turks</hi> being always greedy to ſee the Chriſtians weaken themſelves by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and having now made a Peace with the <hi>Perſian,</hi> were ſo much the more vigilant, if amidſt theſe diſcords a way might not be opened to advantages of their own. This nevertheleſs, as it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily happens that the moſt wicked counſels are the leaſt ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, inſtead of bringing a prejudice to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſerved greatly to advance his Cauſe; for the Proteſtants themſelves, and the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, which took Arms in his favour, upon a ſpecious pretext al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that it was fit they ſhould all joyn for common defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Infidels, to maintain that Frontier which defended <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> from ruine. Nevertheleſs the motion of <hi>Gabor</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:53750:75"/>
was at firſt with great force; for with little oppoſition he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of <hi>Caſſovia</hi> with upper <hi>Hungary.</hi> Afterwards of <hi>Altem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and of <hi>Presburg,</hi> or <hi>Poſſonia,</hi> where he found the Crown, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped by that people, as a teſtimony from Heaven of lawful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. The Confederate <hi>Bohemians,</hi> to joyn with him, enter into <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and failed but a little that they had not poſſeſſed the Bridges of <hi>Vienna,</hi> if <hi>D'Ampiere</hi> and <hi>Marradas</hi> with a ſtout defence had not maintained them. They then advanced towards <hi>Hungary,</hi> when <hi>Buquoy</hi> with 5000 men only meeting <hi>Gabor,</hi> who not far from <hi>Poſſonia</hi> marched with 15000, knowing the <hi>Hungarians</hi> more fierce to charge, than ſtout to maintain a fight, gave them battel, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feats them. But the Victory was not of that importance, as in the diſproportion of their Forces to hinder <hi>la Tour</hi> from joyning with <hi>Gabor,</hi> and entring into <hi>Auſtria</hi> threaten <hi>Vienna</hi> with a Siege; but the ſeaſon being advanced into <hi>November,</hi> and Victuals in the open Country through the licentiouſneſs of the Souldiers being quickly conſumed, they were conſtrained to retire; and the rather becauſe the Archduke <hi>Carlo,</hi> Brother to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> driven in the Revolt of <hi>Sileſia</hi> from his Church of <hi>

The Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> at that time was truly the die of the Fortune of <hi>Europe;</hi> ſome deſired to raiſe her up, others laboured to bring her down; the moſt were to keep her in a moderate condition. All parties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made uſe of the ſame pretexts of Piety and of State, albeit that Princes of ſeveral belief joyned themſelves together, and Religion made War to it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The eyes of the whole Empire were now turned towards the King of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe being ſo nearly allied to the <hi>Palatine,</hi> and in all affairs endeavouring to thwart the advantages of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> it ſeemed that it would be difficult for him not to ingage in Arms. But in that Prince <hi>decorum</hi> and want of power were commonly oppoſites.

He being <hi>Scotch</hi> by birth, and come to the Crown by inheritance, was the firſt that governed the two Nations, by natural Antipathy and ancient emulation Enemies, and deſigning to reclaim the fierceneſs of thoſe people with eaſe and idleneſs, had ſet up his reſt in Peace, and avoided as much as poſſible the calling of Parliaments, without which having not the power to impoſe Contributions, nor levy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he contented himſelf rather to ſtruggle with many ſtraights and difficulties, than ſee them meet with a jealouſie of them, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met, be obliged to ſeparate them with the diſguſt of the people, or with ſatisfaction of prejudice to the Supreme Power. Theſe Novelties of <hi>Germany</hi> coming to his knowledge, he firſt diſapproves the reſolution of his Son-in-law to accept the Crown; afterwards publiſhes at laſt that he would aſſiſt him, and diſpatching an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour to <hi>Vienna,</hi> demands impoſſible Conditions of Peace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that <hi>Bohemia</hi> ſhould remain to the <hi>Palatine;</hi> whereupon from meaſures ſo fickle and ambiguous, the opinion was univerſally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that he inclined more to foment the flames of the Empire, than to extinguiſh them. Neither did the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> aim at other ends, both offering to interpoſe, but neither caring to bring things to a concluſion. Three Diets were held at the ſame time in the Empire, and there were digeſted the common miſeries under the form of ſeveral intereſts. In <hi>Erbipolis</hi> or <hi>Wurtz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> the Electors Eccleſiaſtical, the Biſhop of that City, he of <hi>Bamberg,</hi> and others, together with <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and all thoſe Princes which formed the Catholick League, unto which the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> alſo was now joyned, entring into an aſſociation, reſolved to raiſe an Army, making General of it <hi>Maximilian</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> a Prince of moſt excellent underſtanding, and who above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hath had the wiſdom out of the common intereſts to draw private advantages, by merchanding time, and managing of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The Pope alſo entred himſelf into this Union with a monthly contribution, rather for decency than ſtrength. All this without doubt was to ſerve for ſuccours and advantage to <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> as alſo in another Diet, which the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> with the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the Princes of the <hi>Lower Circle</hi> held, where he, prepoſſeſſed with promiſes of great advantages, declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the <hi>Austrians,</hi> magnifying the Rights of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> which would render the zeal to Religion unjuſt, if, in a cauſe ſo unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, aſſiſtance ſhould be given to the <hi>Bohemians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Imperial Forces being in this manner remarkably increaſed, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> what with his own, and thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> found himſelf ſufficiently ſtrengthened; for the Archduke <hi>Albert</hi> from the Low Countries had ſent him between ſeven and eight thouſand Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and as many being diſpatched by <hi>Oſſuna</hi> for the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived about the end of the year by that way in <hi>Austria.</hi> On the other ſide, the Fortune of <hi>Frederick</hi> declined in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for in the third Diet of the fore-mentioned, of the Princes of the Union aſſembled in his preſence at <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> the City complaining, that the Contributions were diſtributed to the benefit <pb n="139" facs="tcp:53750:76"/>
of a few, who aſſuming ſpecious titles, and the Primacy of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, enjoyed vaſt entertainments, decreed to arm themſelves for their alone defence, and not to furniſh any money to the Army of <hi>Bohemia. Frederick</hi> was then obliged to levy in his own Country about 10000 Foot, and 2000 Horſe, with which entring the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he was in <hi>November</hi> ſolemnly Crowned at <hi>Prague.</hi> But he no ſooner put his foot into the Throne, but having conferred on the Prince of <hi>Anhalt</hi> the Charge of Generaliſſimo of his own, and alſo of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Army; <hi>la Tour</hi> and <hi>Mansfield,</hi> who firſt commanded them, were greatly diſguſted. And ſo the year as to the affairs of <hi>Bohemia</hi> ended. <hi>Frederick</hi> ſignifies to the <hi>Venetians</hi> his taking of the Crown, and they with Letters congratulated, at the ſame time making choice to ſend to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> according to cuſtom, two extraordinary Embaſſadours, which were <hi>Auguſtin Nani</hi> and <hi>Simeon Contarini,</hi> both Knights, though by reaſon of the turbulency of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> their Miſſion was retarded for ſome time, and in place of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> who fell indiſpoſed, was ſubſtituted <hi>Franceſco Erizzo</hi> Knight and Procurator. The Republick, though ſtrongly preſſed, would not intereſt it ſelf in the affairs of the Empire; but for thoſe of <hi>Italy</hi> continued in a greater vigilance, becauſe the deſigns of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters not only appeared diſcovered, but by the Treaſon diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Venice,</hi> although diſſembled, mens minds there remained great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, that which had happened in the <hi>Griſons</hi> came alſo to be conſidered, by which the Republick did believe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that that Monarchy did aim to ſhut up on all ſides the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues and paſſes, ſo to beſiege her, and when an opportunity ſhould require it, to give her ſome notable blow. Neither did the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> themſelves diſſemble the diſtaſt, conceived in the paſt occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, aſcribing to her the reſiſtance made to their deſigns, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting to her, that what with ſuccours to <hi>Mantua</hi> and aſſiſtance to <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſhe had equally aimed to blemiſh and overthrow their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and predominancy in <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> therefore ſeek every where for aſſiſtance and friendſhips far and near. It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not ſafe to relye upon <hi>France,</hi> now involved in domeſtick broils; whereupon it was reſolved to ſign and publiſh the League of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> ſending <hi>Girolamo Cavazza</hi> to the Dukes of <hi>Mantua, Parma, Modena,</hi> and <hi>

               <p>Not one of them had the courage to owne his conſent, though they all applauding it, eſteemed it the only defence of the common

ſafety. Of the greater Princes, to whom communication was given by the ordinary Ambaſſadours, the Pope ſhewed himſelf firm in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, in regard of his Office of common Father, and <hi>France</hi> promiſed to have an eye upon the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> though judged, that to render its ſervices more effectual in caſe of a new Rupture, it was beſt not to declare it ſelf further. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves greatly moved, judging this Alliance as a Seminary of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and bitterneſs. In thoſe Negotiations with <hi>Carlo,</hi> there was intermixed an example of the domeſtick Diſcipline of the Common-wealth, in which Rebellion and Peculat are held to be offences equally to be execrated; for in the adjuſting of the account of Subſidies furniſhed to the Duke, it was found that one month was wanting, and the money being iſſued out of the Treaſury, it was eaſily diſcovered, that it had been converted to the proper uſe of <hi>Anthonio Donato</hi> the Ambaſſadour in <hi>England.</hi> Opinion did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the fact, becauſe, in a perſon adorned with excellent parts, particularly of wiſdom and eloquence, the fault was rendred ſo much the leſs credible, by how much the more he had domeſtick repreſentations of the higheſt integrity of his Anceſtors, amongſt which his Uncle <hi>Leonardo,</hi> Prince of the Republick, and his Father <hi>Niccolo,</hi> an honourable Senator, had given proof in home and foreign imployments, of inflexible minds to whatſoever fault or intereſt. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio</hi> was at that time Ambaſſadour in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> and to clear this account, he had leave to come to <hi>Venice;</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranguing in the Senate with great power and no leſs hope to pacifie mens minds by the merits of his Anceſtors and his own Services, he found, that in caſes the moſt important, Juſtice did not hold the ballance to equalize merits with faults. Being ſummoned to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to render account as a Delinquent, and yielding to it, he was baniſhed with a Sentence of Death, and Confiſcation of Goods, his Name and Poſterity cancelled out of the Order of the Patricians. He retired himſelf into <hi>England;</hi> where <hi>Girolamo Lando</hi> ſucceeding him in the Ambaſſage, moves the King to diſcharge him thence. But the Senate by the League with the Duke <hi>Carlo,</hi> believing by his ſtrong diverſion the State at Land only ſecured from the attempts of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> and by that of the <hi>Switzers</hi> judging to have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves with little more than with the appearance, and ſome numbers of Souldiers, applied themſelves to an equal ſtrength of ſhipping and men alſo on the Sea-coaſt, leſt the Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> ſhould continue his thoughts to diſturb the Iſlands and the Gulph. For this cauſe they liſtened to a Propoſition of Alliance, inſinuated from the United Provinces of <hi>Holland,</hi> in which, beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt of Liberty and Commerce, they had a great deſire to ſtrengthen themſelves with ſome ſtrong ſupport before-hand, if within a while the Truce coming to expire, they ſhould be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a new ingagement with the powerful Forces of <hi>Spain.</hi>

But being propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Venice</hi> for the approbation of the Senate, opinions differed; for amongſt thoſe of the Colledge <hi>Giovanni Nani</hi> judged, that the Concluſion ſhould be deferred, believing that the Republick, though involved in great and grievous ſuſpicions, ought not at this time to intangle it ſelf in that intereſt, which preſuppoſing a perpetual War put her into ſuch and ſo great expences and dangers, that the remedy would be found worſe than the preſent evils. And ſo he ſpake to this purpoſe; <hi>If it be true, that the faith of Princes is a bond not to be untyed, and that Treaties of Leagues, as Marriages, make a Community of Fortune and Intereſts, it is never too late to reſolve upon a Decree which cannot be retracted nor amended. A Decree which concerns an Alliance, not of thoſe States which govern their Councils by the alteration of things, by the viciſſitude of affections, by the corruptions of Miniſters, and the change of Governours, but of two Republicks in their Conſtitution im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, in their Maxims immoveable, and in their Word conſtant. An <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion comprehending a ſhort period, and a limited number of years, yet extends it ſelf to the moſt weighty affairs, and, putting the Republick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a long and inextricable Labyrinth, draws along with it conſequences of great moment; becauſe it hath for its object a perpetual War, in which with unwearied exerciſe of mind the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces defend their Religion and Liberty againſt a moſt powerful King, implacable in the offence, and indefatigable in the reſentment. That the Treaſure of the Republick ſhould be poured forth to the aſſiſtance of the weak, that our aids ſhould be the certain Capital of the oppreſſed, that the Arſenals and Treaſuries ſhould be common to</hi> Italy, <hi>there are ſo ſtrong motives that it cannot be denied; but they have not the ſame force for the affairs of</hi> Holland, <hi>and if they have force, by ballancing the reaſons, it is fit that we meaſure their ſtrength. Our ſuccours perhaps will be large, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to be able to maintain a War, which ſubſiſts upon terms of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Rebellion, irreconciliable with ſubjection and Kingly Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. A War extended to the four parts of the World, which hath no limits, nor can be bounded, which hath emptied</hi> Spain <hi>of People, exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the</hi> Indies <hi>of Gold, and ſwallowed the Blood and Treaſures of</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. <hi>The Republick hath always been moſt juſt in her undertakings, in her own defence moſt circumſpect, and in the aſſiſtance of others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. What is now pretended? is it to take Arms againſt</hi> Spain? <hi>have we Peace with him? is it to preſerve our ſelves? but what more ſafe remedy than the ſparing the vital ſpirits for our own occaſions? Some deſire to perſwade thoſe States, at the end of the Truce to make an end of the War; but if in their inteſtine Diviſions having experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced greater miſchiefs from Peace than hazards in the War, they are thereto perſwaded by their own intereſt; that diverſion will ſurely ſerve to our advantage, and that War will be carried on without us; under the ſhadow of which</hi> Italy <hi>will take breath, and the Republick, protected
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53750:78"/>
by Heaven againſt force and treaſons, will happily enjoy a calm and quiet peace.</hi> Holland <hi>hath the aſſiſtance of their Neighbours, and they moſt potent Princes; ſome conformable to their own Religion, others by a ſuitableneſs to their conveniencies and deſigns, and theſe can and will uphold her with puiſſant Forces. To what purpoſe then haſten our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, if by the ſteps of others, without wearying our ſelves, we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the end of our advantages? The Republick hath to its praiſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to her ſelf the protection of</hi> Italy, <hi>hath maintained it, and doth maintain it with glory; but it would be too vaſt a thought to eſpouſe all the differences of</hi> Europe, <hi>and have to do in every part of the World. If out of prudence we have abſtained from meddling in the affairs of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>why ſhould we pinch our ſelves with thoſe of</hi> Holland? <hi>is it to obtain aſſiſtance? But that people will not be wanting to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to us without a League, who agree with all the World, where there is money and reward. I deny not, but that friends are a great defence, and that in true Meſnagery that Treaſure is not to be valued, which keeps the Monſter of War far off. But do the bonds of friendſhip conſiſt in Treaties only? The affections of Princes are there joyned, where the Intereſts are not ſeparate. Who doubts but that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces will embrace our aſſiſtance, as often as being in diſtreſs it may be ſeaſonable to give it, and render it to us again, when the Conjunction of affairs ſhall ſhew it to be neceſſary? We have hitherto at leaſt drawn Commanders, Souldiers, Ships out of that Country, open to the money of all. That very money, which for the purchaſe of a friendſhip not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary we are here vainly ſo ready to disburſe, ſhall be that, which in oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions more needful and better ſhall bring us aſſiſtance. But if by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable profuſions we ſhall exhauſt our Treaſury, we ſhall have an equal want of defence and friends, and be put to beg of others, rather than receive relief from our ſelves. As for my ſelf, I look at thoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips moſt profitable, which upon equal conditions have their riſe from common conveniencies; but in the caſe in queſtion, how unequal does the fortune and ſtate of things appear! with the Catholick King we may have Peace, nay we ſhall have it, whenſoever moderation ſhall come to be in his Councils. But in</hi> Holland, <hi>where the obſtinacy of a falſe belief, and the deſire of true liberty are contended for, there can be no place for quiet. So that we ſhall be conſtrained to ſubſcribe to a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grievance. Nor ought we here to believe we ſhall enjoy aids reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal, becauſe there being not place for a Treaty which can preſerve from ſuſpicions, or by jealouſies oblige to aſſiſtance, the</hi> Spaniards <hi>will be ſo wiſe as to make War in</hi> Flanders <hi>in earneſt, and in</hi> Italy <hi>in ſhew, revenging himſelf of us by a double blow, the one by the imployment of the money we ſhall be obliged to give</hi> Holland, <hi>and the other by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of all our Forces in a long defence of Land and Sea. Who knows not, that in the Maxims of</hi> Spain <hi>War is covered over with art and time; and on the other ſide thoſe of the Republick conſiſt in the preſerving and defending her ſelf without provoking and offending o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; always in their counſels and reſolutions uniting prudence, juſtice, and time?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This opinion meeting not with the Genius and approbation of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53750:78"/>
all, <hi>Sebastian Veniero</hi> one of the Counſellors, moving the Senate to anger no leſs than jealouſie at the proceedings of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed in the contrary ſenſe: <hi>Nature hath preſcribed to living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures one Element; but Heaven and Earth are too little for ambition. It will be a rare felicity to ſee Princes contented with their own State, in an Age, in which good Conſcience is no more the reward, but Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt is the price of Reigning and of Victory. It is not therefore falſe, that if private men have placed the praiſe of moderation in being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their own, Princes hold the glory of their greatneſs ſetled in the uſurping what is anothers. This Age of ours makes it good, in that the Monarchy of</hi> Spain <hi>ſtanding poſſeſſed by Fortune, Counſel, and Arms, of ſuch vaſt Countries, being nowithstanding hunger-ſtarved, and not to be ſatiated with almoſt two worlds, aſſaults or attempts all that which carries any likeneſs or ſplendour of Liberty and Empire. And amongst its</hi> Arcana, <hi>diſcord hath not the laſt place, which darkly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated and nouriſhed every where, either by the provocation of Religion, or under the title of Intereſt, or the viſard of Ambition and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, diſuniting the minds of Nations, and the intercourſe of Princes, like a hidden Mine razeth the foundations of thoſe Dominions, which it cannot attain to by force. It fears nothing more than the diſcovery of its machinations, or the concord of its enemies. Hence ſo many Arts practiſed on the minds of the</hi> Griſons, <hi>to divert them from our alliance. Hence ſo many complaints for our League with the Cantons of</hi> Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia. <hi>Hence ſo many invectives for our Levy of</hi> Hollanders; <hi>and hence ſo much noiſe for our union with</hi> Carlo. <hi>But we ought to know, that where our Enemies are moſt upon their guard, where they contend moſt fiercely, there is ſeated the pawn of common ſafety. That it behoves the weakeſt to unite themſelves againſt the moſt powerful, is a rule and direction of Nature, and to have ſet that at nought, hath defloured the beauty, and almoſt raviſhed the liberty of</hi> Italy. <hi>The occaſion now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to us the ready means to ſtrengthen quiet to our ſelves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſecurity for our friends, by imbracing the invitation of</hi> Holland. <hi>Experience puts us ſo much in mind, how fatal their Truce hath been to</hi> Italy, <hi>which during the trouble of thoſe Provinces, was happy and quiet. But War ſerving great Princes but for exerciſe, the flame, being quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, is kindled again on this ſide the Mountains. Our Envyers now ſeeking occaſion and advantage for themſelves more than quiet, greater flames lye hidden under the warm aſhes of a teacherous Peace. It belongs therefore to us to carry the tinder ſome whither elſe. For if we reſiſt an open Enemy with force, there is no better guard from a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret one, than by the advantage of a diſtraction. Let us not doubt but that War will ſuddenly break forth again in the Low Countries; but too unequal, to ſay truth, are the Forces of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with thoſe of ſo puiſſant Kingdoms. It is beſt then to re-inforce them with a powerful aſſiſtance, to the end that with equal prejudice to our affairs, thoſe States yield not to the flattering invitations of the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Miniſters by prolonging the Truce, or fall not into great dangers, and at laſt relapſe under the yoke by a weak management of Arms. Nor let faint hopes comfort us, that they are to receive ſufficient aſſiſtances
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53750:79"/>
from the neighbouring Potentates; becauſe we are not now to learn, with what winds, and they moved for the moſt part by the breath of</hi> Spain, France <hi>is driven; and we ſee</hi> England, <hi>that having nothing great but the name, hath a King always in fear to be conſtrained to a War, and his Miniſters to continue Peace in</hi> Holland, <hi>fixed in the ſame reaſons which induced them to procure it. To him then, that knows and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimenteth that he hath the greater need, it belongs alſo to ſet his hand to the remedy; otherwiſe, whilſt one preſerving himſelf by another, and every one ſheltering himſelf under the intereſts of others, more than his own, we ſhall play the game of our Adverſaries, who, fighting with one at a time, are ſure at laſt to conquer all. How can our Common-wealth pretend to be aſſiſted, if at her eaſe ſhe will look on upon others wants? Do we poſſibly truſt in the Peace two years ſince concluded with</hi> Spain? <hi>but what fruit have we hitherto enjoyed by it but the Invaſions practiſed by</hi> Toledo, <hi>the Reſtitutions denied by</hi> Oſſuna, <hi>the Treaſons framed by</hi> la Queva, <hi>Provinces invaded, Towns little leſs than ſurpriſed, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines more and more threatned, the Sea roved, Commerce disturbed, and for the higheſt degree of hatred in others, and dangers to our ſelves, the</hi> Turks <hi>ſollicited to oppreſs us? We may ſuppoſe the intentions of King</hi> Philip <hi>to be good, but certainly the actions of his Miniſters cannot be worſe: and nothing elſe hitherto hath diverted the diſcompoſing of the Treaty, and kindling again the flames of War, but the patience of them that have received and endured injuries. Of a Peace ſo full of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, what more ſafe caution can we for the future procure for our ſelves, than to have Companions, whether it be in Peace or in War? Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, without friends, we ſhall always find our ſelves, amidſt troubleſom ſuſpicions, expoſed to open injuries and ſecret treacheries. And if War be calamitous, jealouſie is miſerable. The friendſhips hitherto contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted are not ſufficient to preſerve us. The Alliances with</hi> Savoy <hi>and the</hi> Switzers <hi>are an ornament to the Peace, and a defence in War: But they open us not the paſſes, they furniſh us not with Souldiers, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect not the maritime Provinces for us, but that this very City, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſeat of Liberty, and Empire ſtands no leſs expoſed to dangers, than that ſhe hath almoſt been a prey to Treachery. Let us then unite our ſelves with</hi> Holland; <hi>becauſe if other Leagues defend our Dominion by Land, ſince it is not the</hi> Spaniards <hi>intereſt to provoke anew a generous Government, which hath taught every one the art how to reſiſt the more powerful; they will in future alſo reſpect the Gulph, not to draw upon them the Arms of that unconquered people, which diſturbs their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the new World, and triumphs in the vaſt Ocean of the</hi> Indies. <hi>By this means our Peace ſhall be defended by faith, but much more by fear. If peradventure that rage be objected, which in a great Prince will be conceived implacable: What occaſion will be for it? What, becauſe we make Alliance with thoſe Provinces, with which</hi> Spain <hi>it ſelf hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a Truce, acknowledging them for Soveraign? Shall we then be ſo unhappy, that friendſhip may no more be contracted betwixt free Princes? But may not our deſigns perhaps be to drive the Catholick King out of his vaſt Territories? Our inſtitution and the moderation of our counſels are not acceſſary to that. The League will do him no hurt,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53750:79"/>
if he promote not injuries; and if he be offended that he finds reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, what greater argument to us to ſuſpect his deſigns? But the charge poſſibly will be increaſed? But where can it be better imployed, than to preſerve us from the worſt of evils? What ſerves our Riches too, if they lye idle, but for a provocation to War, and a reward to a Conquerour? If our Anceſtors have been provident to heap up Treaſures, it belongs to us to be as prudent in the uſing of it, and for fear of growing poor, we ought not to imagine our ſelves always poor; for it is not money but Country and People, which are the moſt opulent Treaſuries of Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This opinion prevailed. Orders then and powers being diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Suriano,</hi> a defenſive League was concluded for fifteen years, in which, in caſe of Invaſion the Republick promiſed 50000 Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins a month to the States, and they on their part an equivalent ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of Men, Ships, or Money, as the Senate ſhould appoint. For the ſolemn Ratification of it, the <hi>Heer Aerſen</hi> was deputed from the <hi>Hagh</hi> to go to <hi>Venice,</hi> and from the <hi>Venetians</hi> into <hi>Holland Girolamo Treviſano,</hi> Ambaſſadours Extraordinary. This League was no ſooner publiſhed, but contrary to that of <hi>Italy,</hi> all the conſiderable Princes of the North deſired to be of it. And for that purpoſe inſtances and frequent Miniſters arrived at <hi>Venice.</hi> In particular <hi>Balthaſar Nei,</hi> Secretary to the Marqueſs of <hi>Anſpach,</hi> and Prince <hi>Magnus</hi> of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> in the name of the Proteſtants of the Union, and of the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> came to demand aſſiſtance, the King of <hi>England</hi> ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening their demand with effectual offices. But the Republick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving not to depart from the defenſive only, did not admit of their inſtances.</p>
               <p>At the Concluſion of this League the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeemed to be greatly ſtrucken, and their Miniſters contrived more and more to increaſe jealouſies and troubles, in particular <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> who, confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promiſed reſtitution of the goods made prize, with the ſhew of new attempts, kept a Squadron of Gallies ready fitted, with all their furniture, to offer at ſome ſurpriſe in the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> with a doubtful report, whether he would fall into <hi>Albania</hi> to the damage of the <hi>Turks,</hi> or of the <hi>Venetians</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia.</hi> In both theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces he had Intelligences and Treaties; and keeping Souldiers alongſt the Coaſt of <hi>Puglia,</hi> gave out that he intended to ſend them to <hi>Trieſte</hi> by Sea.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> conſtant in their reſolution not to ſuffer armed Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels to come into the Gulph, ordered <hi>Lorenzo Veniero,</hi> ſurrogated to <hi>Barbarigo,</hi> deceaſed, into the Procuratorſhip of St. <hi>Marc</hi> and the Charge of Captain General, to hinder it and to oppoſe him with all his force. The Fleet was at <hi>Curzola,</hi> very ſtrong in Ships and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and <hi>Veniero</hi> making choice of twelve light Gallies, new clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and five great ones, made a courſe to the Coaſt of <hi>Puglia,</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sea of ſome Pirate Pinnaces, by taking four, and making himſelf Maſter beſides of a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Veſſel, which laded Corn for <hi>Naples.</hi> He afterwards went back to <hi>Corfu</hi> to ſecure ten Gallies, which were coming from <hi>Candia</hi> to joyn the Fleet, for which the Marqueſs of <hi>Santa Croce</hi> with a Squadron of <hi>Naples</hi> laid wait in their
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53750:80"/>
courſe. But <hi>Anthonio Piſani</hi> avoiding the ambuſh, keeping the other Coaſt, brought them ſafe. <hi>Veniero</hi> then joyning with thirty four Ships, which were in the Roads of <hi>Meleda,</hi> and two, which they had taken, come from <hi>Vallona</hi> with Corn, ſcoured longſt the Coaſt of <hi>Albania,</hi> where he took three which laded Corn for <hi>Naples,</hi> where there was great ſcarcity. At laſt coming to <hi>Pola,</hi> he diſcharged ſome Ships, which were over and above what he had need of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Freletich,</hi> that had done ſome miſchief under the countenance of <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet advanced into <hi>Iſtria,</hi> had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to enter into the Gulph to make prey of ſome Ships; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purſued by ſome Gallies, he ran on ſhore on the Coaſt of the Kingdom, and leaving the Ship with the Arms of the Viceroy in prey to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> with the death of ſome of his, ſaved for that time his own life. At <hi>Naples</hi> alſo the Fleet at laſt ſeparates; for being informed of the defence the Republick had ordered in the Gulph, the Ships were ſent to <hi>Vado</hi> to land the Souldiers appointed for the relief of <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> and the Gallies, under the Command of Prince <hi>Philibert,</hi> joyned to the Squadrons of the Pope, <hi>Malta, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi> and <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> paſſed into <hi>Africk</hi> to attempt upon <hi>Suſa;</hi> the Prince having firſt aſſured the Republick under-hand (who, jealous of ſo great preparations, ordered <hi>Veniero</hi> to aſſemble the Fleet at <hi>Corfu</hi>) that they ſhould fear no diſturbance ſo long as he commanded. But finding the Pirates in <hi>Suſa</hi> upon their guard, and all Poſts already in defence, all they were able to do was but to throw down the firſt Port with a Pettard, and the ſecond being mured up, they were obliged to return with ſome loſs: It being commonly belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as was divulged by the ſuſpicious Genius of <hi>Spain,</hi> that <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> deſirous for his own ends to conſume thoſe Forces of the King, had given the Pirates notice of the deſign. Certain it is, that the right, thoſe Pirates did themſelves, was greater than the loſs; for a while after they ranſacked the maritime Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> burning <hi>Orpeſa,</hi> carrying away Booty and Slaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philibert</hi> in his retreat ſailed within ſight of <hi>Cerigo</hi> and of <hi>Zant,</hi> where the ſame night the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet, much greatned, appeared. Nevertheleſs, although the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gave out they ſought it, to give them battel, they avoided taking their courſe towards <hi>Naples,</hi> under pretext that the <hi>Turks</hi> being infected with the plague, it was not fit to ingage in a fight with them. But they ſtaying a while at <hi>Navar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino,</hi> returned at laſt, as uſual, to winter at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> without other prejudice but the loſs of the Galley <hi>del Bei di Santa Maura,</hi> which was taken by <hi>Octavio d'Arragona.</hi>

The King had commanded, that the Father <hi>Brindiſi,</hi> a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucin of a moſt holy life, gone ſecretly out of the City, ſhould come to the Court, although the Duke had procured to have him ſtopt at <hi>Genoua,</hi> and to his relations being joyned the complaints of many of the Nobility, who were ſecretly gone to <hi>Madrid;</hi> his Favourers, who had been entertained with vaſt gifts, part of his rapinous pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagings, could no longer ſupport him.

               <p>As to the reſt, he protected the people without diſtinction againſt the Barons, and gave out that he would eaſe their grievances, and take away Impoſitions; and paſſing by one day, where, to adjuſt the Impoſt, they were weighing Victuals, he cut the ropes of the Scales with his Sword, giving to underſtand, that he would have the fruits of the Earth unburdened and free, as being the free gifts of the Air and of Heaven.

               <p>The Senate well pleaſed, that their honour was vindicated againſt <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> and <hi>Rivera</hi> chaſtiſed, ordered the Priſoners to be releaſed, and the Ship to be reſtored to <hi>Borgia</hi> the new Viceroy, who in a friendly manner demanded it, and had recalled the Ship <hi>Tiger</hi> from <hi>Manfredonia,</hi> and diſcharged <hi>Freletich</hi> with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Feria</hi> vainly ſhewed at <hi>Milan</hi> a particular reſentment at this ſucceſs, in ſuch ſort that he threatned the Frontiers with an Inrode. But the Senate ordering <hi>Andrea Paruta,</hi> Proveditor on the other ſide of the <hi>Mincio,</hi> to repulſe all ſorts of injuries, provided it ſo well, that the Governour eaſily let fall thoſe thoughts. Two other ſparks were amicably quenched, the one of ſmall moment concerning cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain waters of the <hi>Forno,</hi> diſputed betwixt thoſe of <hi>Monte,</hi> a Town
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53750:81"/>
of the <hi>Cremaſca,</hi> and they of <hi>Poſtino</hi> in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> which was alſo eaſily accommodated on the place by <hi>Anthonio da Ponte</hi> Governour and Captain of <hi>Crema,</hi> and by <hi>Coiro</hi> a Senator of <hi>Milan,</hi> under the title of Commiſſioners. The other carried a greater appearance; becauſe the Prince of <hi>Caſtiglione</hi> being under Pupillage, the Town of <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole,</hi> ſubject to him, ſhook off their obedience.</p>
               <p>The Tutor who was the Signor <hi>di Solferino,</hi> went about to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe it; but the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> declared it under his protection, and ſent a Garriſon into it. The other had recourſe to the Gou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who, to uſe authority and force at once, ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ten Companies of Foot, five hundred Horſe, and four pieces of Cannon. But the Republick, who having thoſe little States within theirs loved not ſuch diſorders, and much leſs that Garriſons of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſhould be introduced there, ſent ſome Souldiers to the Borders, and with the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> and the Guardian paſſed effectual of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, remonſtrating, that as well the aſſiſtances as the enmities of the more powerful were equally dangerous; that for a moſt trivial cauſe they were kindling a great fire which would firſt burn their houſe, and afterwards the reſt of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> it was alſo declared, that the novelty would be extremely grievous, becauſe <hi>Italy</hi> being not yet quitted from the late troubles, might upon every emergency be put again into greater agitations. The Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> to ſay truth, judged not the matter ſuch, as deſerved to diſturb the preſent quiet; and commanding thereupon his Souldiers not to paſs beyond the Confines, interpoſes himſelf, adjuſting the differences by puniſhing ſome of the Mutineers, and pardoning all the reſt. The minds of the Princes nevertheleſs were ſo much diſturbed with jealouſies, that upon every accident they were ſtirred up to apprehenſions, even upon very rumours. The Town of <hi>Sabieneda,</hi> which is of a ſituation of importance, not only to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but alſo to the other neighbourhood, was yielded in Dowry to the Prince of <hi>Stigliano,</hi> one of the chief Barons of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> He being a man of mean parts, allured by promiſes of honours, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of being made a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſhewed himſelf not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have a Garriſon of that Crown put into it. But his Wife, of a more maſculine ſpirit, oppoſed both their flatteries and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, encouraged by under-hand perſwaſions of the Princes, and particularly of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who would not willingly have ſuffered it. Inſomuch that the jealouſie, which ſeemed to be raiſed on that account, preſently vaniſhed. The Republick, amidſt their vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in ſo many places, omitting not the care of the domeſtick policy of their State, ſends three Judges throughout the Country to take a view of affairs for the right adminiſtration of Juſtice, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of oppreſſions and grievances from their Subjects. At <hi>Venice,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Franceſco Vendramino,</hi> Patriarch, being dead, was ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Senate <hi>Giovanni Thiepolo,</hi> chief of the Church of S. <hi>Marco,</hi> a man of ſingular charity towards the poor, and of great magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in the building of Churches, which being propoſed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53750:82"/>
by the Pope himſelf, was confirmed without his going to the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> about this time came to <hi>Venice,</hi> to give thanks for the favours which the Republick had ſo largely contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to his Father, and was entertained and lodged according to the Magnificence belonging to ſo wealthy a City. From the Eaſtern parts came ſome little diſtraction upon mens minds; in that <hi>Ali Baſſa,</hi> formerly Admiral, and one that ſhewed himſelf very troubleſom to the Common-wealth, was at <hi>Constantinople</hi> promoted to be <hi>Grand Viſier.</hi> By ſuch Miniſters is that Empire abſolutely governed, whilſt the Kings, buried in Luxuries and the wantonneſs of the Seraglio, ſhut up from all but vice, give up the ſupreme Authority in their affairs to the baſeſt of Slaves. This man bearing in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Office the affections of a private man, and thoughts of revenge for two <hi>Galiots,</hi> Men of War, taken a good while before by the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Ships, vents preſently his ſpight againſt <hi>Buonricci,</hi> Interpreter of the <hi>Venetian Bailo,</hi> who had proſecuted againſt him in the ſaid buſineſs, cauſing him to be moſt unjuſtly ſtrangled. Amidſt the Faſt of that Nation, maintained by the inteſtine diſcords of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, neither the Right of Nations, nor the practice or reſpect of Princes, is of any conſideration; inſomuch that a little before alſo, the Ambaſſadour of <hi>France</hi> had been ſome days in arreſt, and his Secretary upon falſe pretext put to the Torture. Now the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Republick could not come to the King, but by means of the ſame <hi>Viſier,</hi> and he, to ſtop every paſſage, revived the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that had been ſilenced, of thoſe of <hi>Boſſena</hi> and others, who in the Prize of the Galley of Merchandize had ſuffered loſs, intending to oblige the <hi>Bailo</hi> to reſtitution. Moreover, ſetting on foot moſt unjuſt pretenſions upon the Confines of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> he threatned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions and Incurſions. The Senate, who at the concluſion of <hi>Oſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi> Government had diſarmed <hi>Veniero,</hi> and reduced the Fleet to little more than ordinary Guard, ſent <hi>Anthonio Barbaro,</hi> Procurator, as Proveditor General to take care of the Sea, and be aſſiſtant to <hi>Dalmatia</hi> againſt all injuries of the <hi>Turks.</hi> But before he could be in a readineſs, ſixty <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies laviering without <hi>Corfu,</hi> with all ſigns and tokens of friendſhip, while one part only of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet was at <hi>Merlere</hi> with a force not able to reſiſt, landed in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> at <hi>Manfredonia,</hi> where the Governour of the Caſtle baſely preſented the Captain <hi>Baſſa</hi> with the Keys. The <hi>Turks</hi> contented themſelves to carry away out of the City and thereabouts Priſoners and Booty, retiring before forty eight Gallies of <hi>Spain</hi> could joyn together at <hi>Meſſina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Constantinople</hi> the Miniſters excuſing to <hi>Giorgio Juſtiniano, Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> of the Republick, who made a ſharp complaint of it, their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the Gulph, alledged the provocations and miſchiefs done them by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> was ſoon after ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away by death from the deſigns which he propoſed againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſeim</hi> ſucceeding him, one of more moderate thoughts, with a preſent, according to the cuſtom of the Country,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53750:82"/>
lets fall into ſilence the buſineſs of the <hi>Boſſenians,</hi> applying his mind and forces to a War againſt the <hi>Polacks,</hi> to which <hi>Oſman</hi> pretended to go in perſon. For a pretext of it were alledged cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain differences raiſed by <hi>Gratiano</hi> Prince of <hi>Maldavia,</hi> whom the <hi>Turks</hi> had a mind to diſpoſſeſs of his Country, and the <hi>Polacks,</hi> to maintain him. Others believed, as the truer motive, the inſtances of the Proteſtants of <hi>Germany</hi> to divert King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> from aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſurely true, that the Agents of the new King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and of <hi>Gabor</hi> did entice the <hi>Turks</hi> with a counſel as wicked as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, to weaken a private Enemy, for to ſtrengthen the declared one of all Chriſtendom. The <hi>Bailo</hi> of the <hi>Venetians</hi> by expreſs Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Senate, abſtained from having any thing to do with thoſe Negotiations. But at <hi>Venice</hi> it appeared, as if the Republick had been the Refuge of every one that deſired ſuccours. The <hi>Palatine</hi> demanded an hundred thouſand Ducats at leaſt; <hi>Gabor,</hi> aſſiſtance: And for the Catholick Ligue of <hi>Germany, Zaccaria Trattembach</hi> and <hi>Giulio Ceſare Crivelli,</hi> returning from <hi>Rome,</hi> were earneſt for aid and free paſſage for Ammunition and Souldiers, and that the Conceſſions of the Pope of certain Tenths upon the Clergy of <hi>Italy</hi> might be extended alſo into their Country. But the Senate not yielding to their importunities, nor diverting their thoughts from the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> excuſed to all, with many reaſons, their refuſal. Neither could <hi>France</hi> now, taken up in domeſtick confuſions, be aſſiſtant to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Empire, but with good offices and counſels; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had made choice of the Duke <hi>d' Angouleſme</hi> with <hi>Monſieur de Bethune</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Preo</hi> for Ambaſſadours Extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany</hi> for various ends, not liking on the one ſide, that the Houſe of <hi>Palatine</hi> ſhould be advantaged by that protection which they had always given to the <hi>Hugenots;</hi> and deſiring on the other, under the title of Mediation, to introduce themſelves into the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to foment the diſorders, or end them according to their own mind.</p>
               <p>That Kingdom was ſurely in a very tottering condition; for the Queen-mother had made ſo conſiderable a Party, that, to reſiſt it, the Kings Authority ſeemed not ſufficient, nor <hi>Luines</hi> his favour. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the Council being corrupted, (the Biſhop of <hi>Luſſon,</hi> who preſided, being gained by the Court with great promiſes) it quickly fell to the ground. The King followed by very few Troops, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving quieted <hi>Normandy,</hi> and ſeized the Caſtle <hi>Caen,</hi> comes near to the <hi>Pont de Cé,</hi> where the Duke <hi>de Rhetz,</hi> who with a greater ſtrength was there to defend it, abandons it, either terrified by a needleſs fear, or prepoſſeſſed by the Cardinal his Uncle, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Kings intereſt. From this ſucceſs was derived the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of all the Party, becauſe their Forces were divided in ſeveral Provinces, and the Queen in <hi>Angiers</hi> was expoſed to dangers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon an agreement was on the ſudden concluded, with a general pardon. The Biſhop of <hi>Luſſon</hi> got for himſelf of the King the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to a Cardinals Cap, and laid by this Treaty the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53750:83"/>
of that greatneſs, which did afterwards render him one of the moſt notable and moſt powerful Miniſters of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King reſolving to go on in reſtoring the Catholick Worſhip, and the Eccleſiaſtical goods in <hi>Bern,</hi> a Country in the <hi>Pirenean</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, the chief Shop of Hereſie, and where the name without the preſence of the King was not known, but in a way of mocquery, or for ſome pretext; goes thither, notwithſtanding the cold and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the ſeaſon, and the delays and arts which the people laid in his way; but at laſt, having ſuppreſſed ſome, ſetled Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and truſted the places of ſtrength to the moſt faithful, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, leaving nevertheleſs ſeed ſown in the diſguſts of many of a War near at hand. But in <hi>Germany</hi> the Ambaſſadours of <hi>France</hi> were come to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm,</hi> where were aſſembled the Deputies of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and of the Proteſtant Parties, and there, through their mediation, was firmly eſtabliſhed; That they ſhould not offend one anothers Countries, <hi>Bohemia</hi> notwithſtanding to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, where, without breach of the agreement, Hoſtility might be uſed. It ſeems, that by ſuch a Negotiation the ruine of <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> was concluded; becauſe the <hi>Austrians</hi> being ſecured from <hi>France,</hi> not regarding the bare Offices of <hi>England,</hi> and little fearing the Princes of the Union, which drove vain and uncertain intereſts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the advantage of the Arms of the Catholick League; <hi>Bavaria</hi> being now gained with the hopes to have the ſpoils, and the Vote of the Houſe <hi>Palatine,</hi> his Kinſman but Envyer. In <hi>Milhauſen</hi> the Electors held yet another meeting, from which they ſend exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and intreaties to <hi>Frederick,</hi> that he would lay down that Crown, which now ſhook upon his head; but he knew not how to reſolve to withdraw himſelf from Fortune, though ſhe threatned to forſake him. He was then by the Imperial Ban proſcribed by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> who committed the execution of it to the Archduke <hi>Albert,</hi> to <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Saxony:</hi> All three near about the ſame time march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with powerful Armies towards the month of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> The moſt powerful attempt was from that which came from <hi>Flanders;</hi> becauſe the Archduke in his own name, but with the Forces of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſent <hi>Ambrogio,</hi> Marqueſs <hi>Spinola,</hi> with twenty five thouſand men towards the <hi>Rhine; Louys de Velaſco</hi> being left with conſiderable Forces to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Frontiers towards the United Provinces, with which the Truce being expired, they remained without provocations, but alſo in great diſtruſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giovacchino</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Anſpach,</hi> General of the Union, lay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped with his Army at <hi>Oppenheim,</hi> and had laid a Bridge over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> when <hi>Spinola</hi> having obtained paſſage of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and of ſome Princes and Cities, for fear of the Army and the Imperial Ban, approaches towards him, and made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Creutzenach</hi> without much oppoſition. He then makes as if he would advance towards <hi>Worms,</hi> and <hi>Anſpach</hi> moved for its ſuccours; but the other changing his march falls ſuddenly upon <hi>Oppenheim,</hi> and with a reſolute aſſault carries it, finding within it all the proviſions which were made for the Proteſtant Army. He therefore plants his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53750:83"/>
place of Arms there, repairing the Bridge which had been taken up, and carrying into the <hi>Lower Palatine,</hi> governed by the Duke of <hi>Deux Ponts,</hi> great fear. The weaker places yielded without diſpute, and ſome of the Princes of the Union ſeparated from it. Many taxed <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpach</hi> of want of experience; but he excuſed himſelf upon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders given him by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadours to ſtand upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, without provoking the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> To ſpeak truth, that King made bitter complaints at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> and at <hi>Madrid</hi> to have been amuſed and deluded with the hopes of Peace; nevertheleſs not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging his hand in aſſiſting, he continued by the luke-warmneſs of his mediation to foment the proceedings of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The United Provinces ſhewed themſelves more earneſt, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not at all, that the Arms of the Catholick King ſhould advance to the <hi>Rhine; Maurice</hi> therefore Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> paſſing it with 8000 Foot and 3000 Horſe, ſends <hi>Frederick Henricks</hi> his Brother to joyn <hi>Anſpach</hi> with a good Body of men; but he loſing the time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> returned, ſome few <hi>Engliſh</hi> only under <hi>Horatio Veer</hi> remaining in the Proteſtant Army. If the <hi>Palatinate</hi> groaned under oppreſſions, <hi>Luſatia</hi> experienced a ſcourge yet more cruel; for the ſtrongeſt motives of Religion not having been able to over-ballance the moſt powerful ones of intereſt, and remove the Elector of <hi>Saxe</hi> from adhering to the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> he enters into that Province, and taking <hi>Budiſſen</hi> the Capital City, laid in aſhes for the moſt part by the <hi>Bombes</hi> flung into it, all the reſt ſubmitted to his will. From thence he ſends 14000 men into <hi>Sileſia,</hi> which, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Metropolis <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ratiſlavia,</hi> made themſelves maſters of <hi>Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaw.</hi> This Province and <hi>Moravia</hi> had a little before been over-run by the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> of <hi>Homonay,</hi> and <hi>Frederick,</hi> who held a Diet at <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> had been forced to ſave himſelf from their ſwift Incurſion with four perſons only into <hi>Prague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Moravians</hi> ſent four Ambaſſadours to meet with theſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> to offer them money, that forſaking <hi>Ferdinands</hi> Party they adhere to their intereſt. But the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> with a cruel document killing two of them, let the other go free, that they might relate what was the duty of their fidelity, and what puniſhment they ought to expect from their rebellion. Thoſe Provinces had an effectual tryal, that the yoke of War is more heavy than that of obedience. The upper <hi>Auſtria</hi> alſo confeſſed it with tears and blood; becauſe <hi>Buquoy</hi> having, during the winter-ſeaſon, gently tempted it with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements and Treaties rather than with Arms, <hi>Lintz</hi> being re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by <hi>Mansfelt</hi> with 2000 men, the Province was then confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Rebellion. But the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> being entred into it with 20000 Foot and 4000 Horſe, filled it with ſuch a terrour, that the people, having neither defence nor excuſe, knew not where to reſiſt him, nor how to appeaſe him. The States of the Country aſſembled in <hi>Lintz,</hi> were willing to propound Conditions of Peace; but the Duke deſpiſing them, becauſe they had let him come too near, upon the 4. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> cauſed the Gates to be opened by force. Where ſome of the guilty being puniſhed, the reſt oppreſſed with
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:53750:84"/>
a great Garriſon, and all chaſtiſed with the general ſack and ſpoil of the Country, obedience was re-eſtabliſhed. It was fit to follow for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune while ſhe ſmiled with ſucceſs; and therefore it was reſolved to enter into <hi>Bohemia,</hi> to make an end of the War while it was but beginning. The Duke then taking the one way, and <hi>Buquoy</hi> the other, marched in ſuch a diſtance, that the numbers did not hinder their progreſs, and Victuals were ſupplied to all, each taking in ſuch places and Caſtles as lay in their way. At <hi>Buduais</hi> they met to ſpeak together, thence uniting their Forces, but not their minds, which for ſundry emulations were always in this Expedition at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, they moved towards <hi>Piſec,</hi> and that taken in they advanced to <hi>Pilſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Army of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> ſuperiour in number, but an equal in proweſs and diſcipline, coaſted upon them, and troubled their march. The Chiefs were perſons of no great reputation, and <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> in a Labyrinth of endleſs intereſts, could not govern, nor would be governed. His endeavours to hinder the Catholicks from coming near to <hi>Pilſen</hi> ſucceeded not; but <hi>Mansfelt</hi> ſupplied it with art; becauſe in that place, as in his own Conqueſt, he had fixed the ſeat of his Fortune. By propoſing a Treaty he hoped to gain time, till the ſeaſon ſhould be more advanced to afford him ſuccours. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Duke and <hi>Buquoy</hi> deſpair of drawing him to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; becauſe he feigned diſcontents, which beſides the cuſtom of Mercenaries, wont to abandon their party in the ambiguity of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they might eaſily give credit too in him that ſerved a foreign Prince and a diſtracted people. But he, after ſome days, feigning alſo Orders from <hi>Anhalt,</hi> which in regard of his honour obliged him to make reſiſtance, diſcovers the fraud; whereupon the Catholicks not willing to waſte their Forces in a long Siege, nor entertain For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with lingring hopes, leaving <hi>Pilſen,</hi> went to <hi>Prague. Frederick</hi> aſſaulted from ſo many parts, and worſted in all, was in diſorder; the people ſtood in a fright, and the Army was wavering. Near to <hi>Raconits</hi> the Armies met, and that of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> was driven from moſt of their Poſts, <hi>Buquoy</hi> being hurt, which nevertheleſs hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him not to go on in his march. <hi>Anhalt</hi> perceiving whither the Enemy bent, ſent <hi>la Tour</hi> before to <hi>Prague</hi> with ſome Troops, and himſelf, leaving the Baggage behind, by ways to rights haſtens thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to prevent their poſſeſſing of the <hi>Wiiſemberg</hi> or <hi>White Hill,</hi> in which might much conſiſt the defence of the City, of a vaſt circuit, open in ſeveral parts, and in many commanded, and that within ſhot.</p>
               <p>A little after arrive there alſo the Duke and the Count, ſo that both the Armies were now near to <hi>Prague.</hi> The <hi>Bohemian,</hi> in the ſuperiority of Forces ſhewing a diſtruſt of courage, intrench upon the higheſt part of the Hill, placing their Cannon in certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts, and part of their Souldiers in the Park, called the Star, a place of pleaſure for their Kings. There was in the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Army the Father <hi>Domenico</hi> of <hi>Gieſu Maria,</hi> a bare-footed <hi>Carmelite,</hi> repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a man of ſingular piety, who ſtirred up the Chiefs to fight, promiſing a certain Victory. But in the Council there was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53750:84"/>
of opinions, ſome conſidering the Enemies greater number, and particularly of Horſe, and others the diſadvantage of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that the Souldiers before they could come to handy blows with the Enemy, were to go a good way expoſed to the Cannon and Muſket-ſhot. Some added the unevenneſs of the Hill, which by ſeveral ſloapings and in windings, gave the <hi>Bohemians</hi> means to fortifie themſelves, and at every paſs to make good their Retreat. But hope of Victory and the greatneſs of the recompence over-ballancing dangers, the Battel was reſolved on. <hi>Anhalt</hi> kept the Ports of <hi>Prague</hi> ſhut to take away from the Souldiers the hope of eſcaping thither. In the Army he took for himſelf the right Wing, and aſſigns to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach</hi> the left. <hi>Frederick,</hi> though ſo chief a part of the Judgment of Fortune, ſtood in a place a little remote to obſerve the event.</p>
               <p>Of the Catholicks the Imperialiſts had the right, and the <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> the left hand. Their Word was the Glorious Name of the Virgin, under the protection of which, repreſented in the chief Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, the Wing of the <hi>Bavarians</hi> moved, over which, next the Duke, <hi>Giovanni</hi> Count of <hi>Tilly</hi> commanded. To come to the Hill they were to file over a Bridge, and then to paſs a dirty Valley, and in that diſadvantage the young <hi>Anhalt</hi> would have charged them, if the Count of <hi>Hollach</hi> had not ſtaid him; whereupon the Catholicks diſ-engaged themſelves, and being defended from the Cannon with the riſing of the Hill, they advanced in better order. <hi>Buquoy</hi> to avoid the Cannon-ſhot, to which his men, divided into three great <hi>Battallions</hi> with Horſe on the Wings, ſtood moſt expoſed, haſtened his pace and came to the charge at the very ſame time that <hi>Tilly</hi> made his attaque. The ſhouting of the Souldiers, the noiſe of the Drums, and the roaring of the Cannon deafned Heaven, making the Hill a deadly Theatre of outrage and ſlaughter. The two Armies conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of more than ſixty thouſand men. At the beginning advantage ſmiled on the <hi>Bohemians;</hi> for young <hi>Anhalt,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the Count <hi>Slich,</hi> repulſed the firſt Charge, purſuing the Enemy with the gain of ſome Colours, the death of <hi>Prainer,</hi> and dead wounds of the Colonel <hi>Macau.</hi> The Proteſtants hereupon cry out Victory. But the Veteran Squadrons of the Catholicks, giving themſelves not for loſt upon the firſt accident, nor ſuffering themſelves to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by clamours, returned ſo home a Charge, that <hi>Guilielme Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dugo</hi> that commanded the <hi>Walloons,</hi> poſſeſſed one of the Redoubts with three pieces of Artillery, and took Priſoners <hi>Anhalt</hi> and <hi>Slich</hi> before mentioned. <hi>Fetheu</hi> turns the Cannon againſt the others, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing execution, and bringing terrour. The <hi>Hungarian</hi> Cavalry fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the yelling of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and beaten with the thick hail of Muſkets, be gave themſelves to a haſty flight, drawing after them a good part of the Infantry of the <hi>Bohemians, Hollach</hi> abandoned by all, his Horſe being killed under him, had much ado to retire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Anhalt</hi> the General with his voice and with his hand exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laboured to ſtop the Run-aways, and put them again in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but fear being deaf, he ſaves himſelf at laſt, after timely notice given to the King <hi>Palatine</hi> to provide for his ſafety. The Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53750:85"/>
of <hi>la Tour,</hi> drawn up into a Battaillon, was the laſt that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated after a great reſiſtance. All the Hill was ſeen covered with dead bodies and fugitives. He that had his Arms looſe flung them away, and many that were heavy armed periſhed in the <hi>Molda,</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an eſcape by the River, while the Gates of the City remained yet ſhut. The Battel laſted not above two hours, the Conquerours wearying themſelves more in the ſlaughter than they had done in the fight. The Count of <hi>Merode</hi> makes towards the five thouſand <hi>Bohemians,</hi> which had their Poſte in the Star-Park, receiving them into ſubmiſſion with their Colours in a bundle, and with their Arms hardly obtaining their lives from the fury of the Souldiers, who with the wearineſs of the ſpoil alone remained ſatisfied. The Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was all taken by the Victorious with more than one hundred Colours. The dead on the ſide of the Conquered were above ſix thouſand, with as many more Priſoners, the reſt ſcattered and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated in ſuch ſort, that they could no more rally themſelves again. At the miracle of ſo great a Victory both Conquered and Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours were overcome with amazement; that of the Catholicks there were not reckoned above three hundred ſlain. This Battel, which happened on the 9. of <hi>November,</hi> confirmed the Kingdom to the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> and to all the Catholicks the Empire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frederick</hi> got back into <hi>Prague,</hi> demands twenty four hours of Truce; but <hi>Bavaria</hi> would grant only eight, within which he was to abandon the Title and the Kingdom. He without other Reply, the next morning with his Wife and little Children flyes out of the City; leaving a memorable Example, That Ambition, a ſplendid Guide, but little ſecure, like nocturnal Lights in the Air, leads him that follows to deſtruction. By unfrequented ways he arrives at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ratiſlavia,</hi> and the Catholicks, the way being made for them by the Victory, might have entred that night into <hi>Prague</hi> (for the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons</hi> came cloſe to it on the higheſt ſide of <hi>San Lorenzo</hi>) if the Chiefs, fearing under the darkneſs of the night the cruelty, outrage, and villanies of the Souldiers had not forbid it. The following morning thoſe ſame <hi>Walloons,</hi> aſſiſted by the Catholick Inhabitants, by ſome open places and by Scalade got within the Wall. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> being retired to the other ſide of the River into the old Town, rendred themſelves without more ado. The Duke reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much as he could licence and ſpoil. After thanks rendred to God, and the Oath of Fidelity taken in the Name of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he leaves his Troops in the Kingdom, and returns into his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Prince of <hi>Lichteſtein,</hi> left Governour of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> takes the Caſtle of <hi>Carleſtein,</hi> where the Crown of the Kingdom was kept by a Garriſon of ſix hundred, ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſome <hi>Scotch. Buquoy</hi> on the other ſide entring into <hi>Moravia,</hi> at his appearance only redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it to obedience, vipartiting there, for a puniſhment, his Troops into Winter-quarters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frederick</hi> now found himſelf indeed caſt out of the Throne, not ſo much by the Arms of his Enemies, as by inteſtine diſorders. He exerciſed a precarious Command, every one of thoſe who had lifted
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53750:85"/>
him up to the Crown, pretending at his pleaſure now to deny him obedience. The Count of <hi>Hollach,</hi> ill looked upon by all, had the favour of his greateſt confidence; the principal <hi>Bohemians</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived great diſguſt, and the moſt part of the Strangers had ſerved at their own charge. The Souldiers not being paid, had with their violences provoked the Peaſants. Religion it ſelf, divided into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sects, divided alſo mens minds, and <hi>Frederick</hi> with Edicts in favour of his Calvaniſm had offended many, and raiſed ſome tumult amongſt the people. In ſum, after this all loving liberty, no body would be at the charge, or run the hazards of it; and many being deceived, in the belief of making their private fortunes in the loſs of the publick, denied to contribute, others did it ſcantily, and it was ſaid that ſome taxed at two thouſand Florins, and not willing to give more than five hundred, left after the battel, when they fled from <hi>Prague</hi> three hundred thouſand Dollers in prey to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. In <hi>Hungary</hi> a Diet held in this interim in the preſence of an Ambaſſadour <hi>Turk,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> had not been able to conclude the Peace, and the Truce expired, the War began anew, and <hi>D'Ampiere</hi> taking a view of <hi>Poſſonia,</hi> for the applying of a Pettard, loſt his life by two Muſket-ſhot. Nevertheleſs after the battel of <hi>Prague, Gabor</hi> inclined to Peace; but demanding the charge of <hi>Palatine</hi> of the Kingdom, which is the ſame as Viceroy, he could not effect it. He taking the Kingly Title, and ſolliciting the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> anew to aſſiſt him, did not obtain it, although to incite them, he offered to cauſe the Town of <hi>Segna,</hi> formerly ſo troubleſom to them, to fall into their hands. The year 1620. ending with ſuch ſucceſſes in <hi>Germany,</hi> although the Fortune of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be bettered, yet men perceived that the War nouriſhing it ſelf with its own blood, increaſed rather, than had the leaſt ſhew of coming to a period. The affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> went on as if meaſured by equal ſteps; for according to the accidents of <hi>Germany, Feria</hi> did ſometimes ſuſpend, and at others promote his deſigns upon the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teline.</hi> In the <hi>Griſons</hi> for ſome months the peoples minds had been quiet, rather than at concord; the baniſhed under-hand ſolliciting <hi>Feria</hi> continually for aſſiſtance. Some of the Commons foreſeeing themſelves, that they were not able to ſubſiſt of themſelves, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that no Prince, more diſ-intereſſedly than the <hi>Venetians,</hi> were like to uphold their liberty, called from <hi>Zurich,</hi> with an intent to make a League, <hi>Pietro Vico</hi> Reſident for the Republick, who had no ſooner ſet his foot in the <hi>Griſons;</hi> but hearing of the Revolt of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> thought beſt to defer his Negotiation to a more quiet ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Valteline</hi> is a ſtreak of Land, which exceeds not fifty miles in length, and being of a various breadth, ſurpaſſes not twenty five, watered by the River <hi>Adda,</hi> ſituate in the midſt of the Mountains in the extremity of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſeems cut out by Nature to divide States and ſeparate Confines. It hath <hi>Tirol</hi> towards the Eaſt, and the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> towards the Weſt; on the North <hi>Rhetia</hi> commands it, and on the South it borders with <hi>Breſcia</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi> Territories
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53750:86"/>
of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> The River diſcharges it ſelf into the Lake of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> and on the one ſide and on the other a Plain is extended, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled therefore with many Towns, and where the Mountains are any thing low, abounds with Corn, Wine, and Cattel which feed it, and by imparting thereof to Strangers, inriches it alſo. At its beginning and ending it hath, as Appendixes, the Counties of <hi>Bormio</hi> and <hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vena;</hi> the firſt joyns to <hi>Tirol,</hi> and pierces with vaſt high Mountains deep into <hi>Rhetia,</hi> the other on this ſide of the <hi>Spluga</hi> declining into a little Plain faces to a Lake, which though it be a narrow part of that of <hi>Como,</hi> yet under a divers name is called the Lake of <hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vena.</hi> All this Country, ſubject to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> ſought with all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, conjunctures, and pretexts to withdraw themſelves from their Dominion, and matter of Conſcience ſuggeſted to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple motives very effectual; becauſe the Leagues ſending them Judges and Magiſtrates, for the moſt part infected with Hereſie, it ſeemed by their founding of Colledges, and building of Churches, as if their aim were, not only to ſpread it through the Valley, but alſo to introduce it into <hi>Italy,</hi> where the true Religion reſiding as under Wardſhip, errours cannot be admitted or tolerated. Upon this ſtock of univerſal piety, the baniſhed grounded their deſire of being reſtored to their Country, and Princes their intereſt; the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians</hi> in particular, who conſidered the <hi>Valtelline,</hi> as in effect it is, as a Gallery, which uniting the Countries of <hi>Germany</hi> with thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeparates the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> from the aſſiſtance of Strangers. The Count of <hi>Fuentes,</hi> who more than any former Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Milan</hi> had inlarged his authority in that Province, was wont to counſel his King, that to put Fetters upon <hi>Italy, Monaco, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and the <hi>Valtelline</hi> were to be poſſeſſed by him. Of the two firſt the deſign proving eaſie, the laſt, as the moſt difficult, was reſerved for a better conjuncture, the <hi>Griſons</hi> making themſelves conſiderable by their adherencies, as well as their ſtrength; and it appearing that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> not only for their own, but were eaſily moved for anothers intereſt. The Count notwithſtanding layes the firſt ſtone, planting the Fort, which commands the entrance into the Valley. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> by faſt bonds being now indiſſolvably united to <hi>Spain,</hi> nothing was wanting for the convenience and ſtrengthening of the common Monarchy, but to conjoyn their States, and if by poſſeſſing the <hi>Lower Palatinate,</hi> a great paſſage was opened for <hi>Germany</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with <hi>Flanders,</hi> by making themſelves Maſters of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telline,</hi> the one and the other were linked unto <hi>Italy.</hi> The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal perſons of that Valley, and in particular the <hi>Piantaes</hi> and the Cavalier <hi>Robuſtelli,</hi> offered to ſeize it with ſo much facility, that <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> had no other thought but to enjoy the prize. They repreſented the deſires and invitations of the people groaning under the yoke of a baſe Government, which having avarice for a Law, ſold Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Magiſtrates, that they might expoſe Juſtice to ſale to the people. They conſidered the Order of Nature it ſelf in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Country perverted, where the worſt poſſeſſing more authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than the better, there remained nothing that was not venal;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53750:86"/>
Goods, Life, Honour, nay Conſcience it ſelf: nor could more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs be practiſed by the Judges, nor more miſery be endured by the people. What better opportunity was to be looked for than this, in which <hi>Rhetia,</hi> torn to pieces with Factions, is neither capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to command nor to obey, no not to it ſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> was incumbred with its own diſcords, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> while the Conjuncture favoured them, did rather divert blows than reſent them, if given on a ſudden they came to ſucceed happily. Though Peace in <hi>Italy</hi> was at that time moſt neceſſary for <hi>Spain, Feria</hi> nevertheleſs quickly aſſents to the Propoſition; for if it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not, it coſt only the baniſhment or lives of ſome few; and if it took effect, he thought the advantage ſuch as might deſerve at leaſt ſome little hazard and pains. Beſides the deſire to ſignalize his Government, he did believe he ſhould not want excuſes and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents to colour his attempt, nor devices, or a Treaty to divert coming to Arms. Theſe were the cauſes of the new War in <hi>Italy;</hi> in the baniſhed deſire of liberty; in the people zeal to Religion, and in the Princes Intereſt of State and mutual Jealouſies. In the month of <hi>July</hi> began the Revolt of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> into which there coming down by concert three hundred men out of <hi>Tirol,</hi> the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try riſing in a tumult of a ſudden, it ſeemed like a flaſh of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which over-ran it in a moment. The Governours of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, in particular the Heads of the Families, which were to the number of three hundred, were killed, and under the Cloak of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were committed execrable villanies, much innocent blood ſhed, Eſtates violently taken away, and private revenges exerciſed. The Catholicks immediately choſe new Magiſtrates to ſway this new Government, and fortified certain places of importance with money from <hi>Spain.</hi> From the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> alſo Souldiers came filing on, and from the Fort <hi>Fuentes</hi> Cannon deſcended, otherwiſe without this ſtrengthening the fire would have been quenched, while it was kindling. The Count <hi>Giovanni Serbellione</hi> raiſed men for <hi>Feria;</hi> but the name of the Pope was pretended, the better to cover the deſign. The <hi>Venetians</hi> more than any other ſeemed ſtrucken with this accident; becauſe beſides the increaſe of power to the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> by whom they ſaw themſelves encompaſſed with a line of little leſs than five hundred miles, they ſaw alſo the way ſtopped for any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, but from Levies in their own Countries. And for that cauſe both to the Pope and to the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> they made ſerious remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances for Peace, prognoſticating the evils to come, and ſhewed the diſtractions which would ariſe upon it. Bur all offices being vain, they apply to ſtrengthen themſelves, ſtir up their friends, and give vigour to the oppreſſed. Judging that their advantage conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in not giving time to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the formerly baniſhed to ſettle themſelves in the poſſeſſion, they exhorted the <hi>Griſons</hi> to a ſudden attempt to recover what they had loſt, by alluring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with a general pardon and ſecurity to the Catholick Religion in the Valley. They perſwaded alſo the <hi>Switzers,</hi> upon the ground of their Alliance with the <hi>Griſons,</hi> to take Arms, and promiſed on their
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53750:87"/>
ſide to be aſſiſtant, diſburſing money to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and ſixteen thouſand Ducats to the two Cities of <hi>Bern</hi> and <hi>Zurich</hi> to arm two Regiments. Indignation and common intereſt not prevailing ſo much with that people as gold and private profit moves them, in <hi>Rhetia</hi> with that impulſe of money they raiſed twenty four Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, haſtening therewith to provide <hi>Chiavena,</hi> upon which the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers had their eye. Seven entred into the Valley on that ſide, taking in at the firſt aſſault <hi>Traona,</hi> and certain Trenches guarded by the Captain <hi>Carcano Milaneſe.</hi> But coming with little order near to <hi>Morbegno,</hi> garriſoned by <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they were repulſed. But they had their revenge at <hi>Sondrio,</hi> taking the place. All this could not be acted without much ſlaughter and diſorders, the <hi>Griſons</hi> being blooded and inraged. Fear therefore ſpreading it ſelf, Fryars, Nuns, and many other retired into the State of the Republick, which gave order that the perſons and holy things ſhould be received and kept with great care. Such an Invaſion nevertheleſs was like a Torrent of a Land-flood, which pouring forth all at once from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, quickly vaniſhes. Thoſe of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> re-inforced from the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> with four thouſand Foot, and four hundred Horſe, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque them, and drive them from the Bridge of <hi>Ganda;</hi> thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering <hi>Traona</hi> and <hi>Sondrio,</hi> they took alſo in the County of <hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vena, Riva,</hi> and <hi>Nova.</hi> Animated afterwards with this ſuperfluity of Fortune, having a mind to attacque <hi>Poſchiavo,</hi> which is a Town of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> where, coming down from the Country of <hi>Bern,</hi> is the ſtraighteſt paſſage of the Valley, being beaten, they returned back. The Proteſtant <hi>Switzers</hi> cauſing ten Colours to advance, partly to ſecure <hi>Chiavena,</hi> partly to give courage to the Commons of the <hi>Agne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina,</hi> came down to <hi>Bormio,</hi> ſtrengthened with ſome Troops of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and, forcing the ſtraights of the paſſages, drive the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> thence with the loſs of two Captains. This County was of great concernment to both the Parties; becauſe, ſeparating the Valley from <hi>Tirol,</hi> and without joyning to it, communicating from <hi>Rhetia</hi> with the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> it might from <hi>Germany</hi> and from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick receive and give mutual ſuccours. <hi>Andrea Paruta,</hi> General of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſent ſeaſonably Arms, Ammunition, and Souldiers for its better guard, when the <hi>Griſons</hi> and <hi>Switzers,</hi> impatient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſo opportune a ſuccour, and preſuming upon equal ſucceſs in whatſoever they undertook, would needs advance into the <hi>Valteline.</hi> But proceeding in their march without order, and diſpoſing of their Quarters without defence; all Diſcipline and Conduct failing, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Tirano,</hi> and being reſolutely received by a Body of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Souldiers, they were defeated with the loſs of two Colours, and the Colonel of the Regiment of <hi>Bern.</hi> In place of retiring to <hi>Bormio,</hi> they thought of nothing but returning to their homes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning the Town and the County; whereupon thoſe of the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> enter again into it without oppoſition. <hi>Feria</hi> gave out, that his aſſiſtance was only in defence of Religion, for which there appearing no caution offered to him which was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, he denied to withdraw it, as was propoſed, to make place
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53750:87"/>
for ſome compoſure betwixt thoſe of the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the <hi>Griſons.</hi> But he knowing of what advantage diſcord amongſt Enemies was to overcome them, ſows it among the <hi>Helvetians;</hi> whereupon the Catholick Cantons riſing up againſt the Proteſtants, ſhut the paſſes of entrance into the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and having raiſed fifteen hundred men, with two Companies of the Vallies threatned to enter into the Valley of <hi>Muſocco,</hi> to aſſiſt thoſe of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and ſuch of the commons of the <hi>Griſons</hi> as profeſſed the Catholick Faith. The Cities of <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich</hi> and <hi>Bearn</hi> dejected with the blow received at <hi>Tirano,</hi> diverted by the threatnings of their Confederates, and amongſt themſelves intangled by many arts and conſiderations, left <hi>Rhetia</hi> expoſed to their Enemies and in prey to their own diſorders.</p>
               <p>The Arch Duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> Brother of the Emperor, in this while arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Tirol,</hi> and publiſhing his pretenſions of Soveraignty over ſome of the Commons of the Ten Directorſhips, it appeared that his aim was to reduce all the Country to the ancient ſubjection of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians.</hi> The Affairs ſtood in this manner much ſtraitned, no ſuccours appearing from <hi>France,</hi> but rather the Miniſters of that Crown in <hi>Rhetia</hi> made things more intricate; becauſe at the inſtigation of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> though againſt the mind of the Ten Directorſhips, <hi>Gheffier</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called to <hi>Slants,</hi> where the <hi>Pittach</hi> was held, he perſwaded the People to approve certain Articles, which nevertheleſs were to be confirmed by the Crown, by which the judgment of <hi>Tava</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, that of <hi>Coira</hi> ſhould be revived, with the factions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which in conſequence went along with it. This ſerved to play the <hi>Spaniards</hi> game; for the <hi>Lega Griſa,</hi> proteſting againſt theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations, the Government thereby growing into greater confuſion, neglecting the <hi>Valteline,</hi> applied not remedies to the preſent evils.</p>
               <p>The beſt reſolution was to ſend Ambaſſadors to <hi>Venice, Hercules Salica</hi> Cavalier, and <hi>Conſtantino Pianta,</hi> the firſt whereof dying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the declaring their Commiſſion, leaves to his Collegue the care of repreſenting the need which <hi>Rhetia</hi> had of the authority of their counſels, no leſs than of the aſſiſtance of their Forces, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment languiſhing in diſcord and confuſion, the People uncapable to diſcern their evil, or diſcerning it to apply the remedies: The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate knew of what importance it was to take the charge of a body, that not being able to govern, but rather diſturb it ſelf, could be of no ſervice but to incumber others alſo. Yet it being not fit to put him in deſpair, they ſend back <hi>Pianta</hi> with hopes of good aſſiſtance, when the people reflecting upon their miſeries, ſhould be willing to put a hand to their own preſervation. But in its more ſecret refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they looked upon <hi>Italy</hi> henceforward in a condition not to be able of it ſelf to bear up againſt the Arms and Arts of the <hi>Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> They thought it therefore neceſſary, for the remedy of one power, to raiſe up another of contrary intereſts and opinions, ſince the balance of <hi>Europe</hi> conſiſts in two Kingdoms which would be equally formidable, if in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ambition were not corrected by ſparing, and in the <hi>French</hi> force was not weakened by incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. The Senate ſends <hi>Girolamo Priuli</hi> Ambaſſador extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53750:88"/>
to <hi>Paris,</hi> to the end, that informing that King of the ſtate of things, he might perſwade him to aſſiſt his ancient Confederates, and offer them for that purpoſe the union of his Forces. With wonted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements of profit and favour, <hi>Dediguieres</hi> upon the firſt motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come into <hi>Italy,</hi> to whom the care of that Country ſeemed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſpeaks with the Duke <hi>Carlo</hi> at <hi>Turin,</hi> in the preſence of <hi>Giovanni Peſari</hi> Ambaſſador of the Republick. Several ends diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered themſelves in that conference; for the aim of the <hi>Venetians</hi> tended to nothing elſe, but either by Treaty or by Arms to bring things to ſome kind of compoſure, that might reſtore the <hi>Valteline</hi> to its former eſtate, and the liberty of the <hi>Griſons.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Carlo</hi> who kept the Gates of the <hi>Alps,</hi> not regarding thoſe other paſſages aimed to draw the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> to the end that making a general change in the ſtate of things, his own might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged according to ſucceſs, and he might enjoy the ſpoils of others loſſes. Now the only deſign of <hi>France,</hi> was to intereſt it ſelf no farther than by Treaty and name, propoſing that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick ſhould charge upon it ſelf the burden and the War; for which purpoſe <hi>Deſdiguieres,</hi> in quality of a private Captain, offered under their pay to raiſe in an inſtant ten thouſand Foot, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and to paſs them through <hi>Helvetia</hi> into the <hi>Griſons;</hi> but the <hi>Venetians,</hi> excuſing themſelves upon the ſeaſon, ſo far advanced, which made the paſſage difficult, did not embrace the propoſal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting that they would not be alone; but that in the Cauſe which was common the Crown alſo ſhould concur, and the <hi>Switzers</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled then at <hi>Badan</hi> upon theſe occurrences. Nothing therefore was concluded in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> but in <hi>France Priuli,</hi> being arrived at Court, and found the King rid of the diſagreements with his Mother and the Voyage of <hi>Bearn, Declares the intenſions of the Republick to be, that Religion ſhould be ſecured, and the Country reſtored, to preſerve to God and the Princes that which divine and humane right had imparted to them. He offers the conſideration, that</hi> Italy <hi>deſpoiled in a manner of the ornaments of its liberty, of its ſtrength, and of its beauty, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend deſtruction, being invironed with a formidable power, watching on occaſions ready to take advantages, greedy of conqueſts, and tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in keeping them. That in the ſupport of that Crown alone was placed the hopes of the</hi> Griſons, <hi>a people, it may be ſaid, protected from their very beginning, and by the conſtancy in their friendſhip ready to fall under the Yoak. True it was that the Republick was concerned in the neerneſs, but nevertheleſs glory ought to ſtir up the King, who was bound to render an account to publick fame of the diſtreſs of his moſt faithful friends. That</hi> Europe <hi>had hopes now in his youth of fruits equal to juſtice and power, the one being due to the oppreſſed, and the other required by his own and common intereſt. That in his Kingdom he had by both triumphed over two of the fierceſt Monſters, Hereſie and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. That now Heaven reſerved for him the honour of conquering the ambition of Strangers, and overthrowing the ſlavery of</hi> Italy. <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſo much expected in that afflicted Country, as the happineſs of his conduct and authority to add new examples to the old, that in its

               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> judging it their great advantage, that the buſineſs of the <hi>Valteline</hi> ſhould paſs for a matter of Religion, to the end that amidſt applauſes, excuſes, and pretexts, ſome Princes might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and others proceed with greater caution, applied all care
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53750:89"/>
well to impreſs the Pope with that opinion, to their offices of duty joining other means, and in particular to gain his Kindred, having for that purpoſe created the Prince of <hi>Sulmona</hi> his Nephew Grande of <hi>Spain. Paul</hi> nevertheleſs, having had the teaching of a long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, preferred Peace before all flattery, nor did believe it fit, that, confounding together the intereſts of Religion and State, the Popes ought to expoſe themſelves to the enmity of great Princes, or put themſelves to have need of the aſſiſtance of the more powerful. He applied therefore to a neutrality, as a courſe more prudent, than what the Princes ſhewed themſelves pleaſed with. But in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the year, having in a certain eccleſiaſtical function ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wearied and inflamed himſelf, he paſſes to Heaven to render an account of the World, over which for the direction of Souls he had been for ſixteen years placed in the Popedom. Ever ſince to the Eccleſiaſtical Dignity a worldly Power hath been ſuperadded, and that the corruption of the Age hath with the veneration of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things confounded alſo humane reſpects, Princes have very often in the election of Popes cauſed to be profaned with their intereſts, that which the Church poſſeſſes of moſt pure and moſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. But God that hath eſpouſed it with the Ring of his true Faith, protects it from violence, confounds the counſels, puniſheth the attempts, and preſerving it by his holy Spirit, makes it clearly evident, that though the Conclaves are not exempt from factions, and affections, nevertheleſs, the counſels of man ſeldom ſucceeding, the lot falls where Divine Providence directs it.</p>
               <p>For the preſent by how much the ſuſpence of the Affairs of the <hi>Valteline</hi> was more embroiled, with ſo much the more diligence did the Princes effectually labour to prevail with their partiſans, to cauſe the Pontificate to fall upon him, that either by his own inclination adhered to their wills, or in regard of the Family and Kindred was like to be more eaſily gained. The will of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and of the Nephew of the dead <hi>Pope</hi> inclined to Cardinal <hi>Campori</hi> of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona,</hi> ſubject not only by birth, but by affection partially addicted to <hi>Spain,</hi> and by conſequence for the ſame reſpects abhorred by <hi>France,</hi> and it appeared as though the election was not to be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, ſo ſtrong was that party, although together with his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate enviers, the Marqueſs <hi>de Coure</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> did open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe him. But the minds of the Conclave unexpectedly alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, contrary to the opinion of themſelves, all concurred unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in <hi>Alexander,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Lodoviſio, Boltogneſe</hi> by birth, who took the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Fifteenth. He almoſt ſeventy years old, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to quiet more than buſineſs, leaves quickly the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affairs to his Nephew, now a Cardinal, who governed them through the whole courſe of this Pontificate, with great ability and an authority ſupreme. The Princes ſtudiouſly contended to poſſeſs the Pope in their favour, in the buſineſs of the <hi>Valteline, Favin</hi> ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licites thoſe People to ſend Deputies to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they might fill all with clamours and complaints, ſo to ſtir up com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards thoſe that made a ſhew to breathe nothing but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53750:89"/>
and Liberty, motives ſo powerful, that the one with reaſon poſſeſſes the chief place in things ſacred, and the other in civil. He ſends alſo <hi>Giovanni Vives,</hi> a known Miniſter of the advantages of the Monarchy, and of the diſturbances of <hi>Italy,</hi> and joyns to him the Preſident <hi>Acerbi;</hi> who, during his private Fortune, had been fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with the Pope, that ſo in publick Audiences and private Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, he might continually have his ears beaten with the incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of zeal and piety. The Ambaſſadour of the <hi>Venetians</hi> on the other ſide endeavoured to repreſent that affair in a contrary ſhape, and ſeparate from Religion. Becauſe that, <hi>If the Republick kept it with ſo much care unviolated in its own Dominions, it could no leſs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to be defiled amongst their Neighbours. But it was not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, that under a pretext of Piety, Intereſt ſhould intrude it ſelf, to the poſſeſſing of a Country, to which the</hi> Spaniards <hi>had no other title but that of their own profit and convenience, and the oppreſſion of others.</hi> The Pope was greatly perplexed at theſe beginnings, and deſired a compoſure of the buſineſs; and thereupon with his own hand wrote into <hi>Spain</hi> to the King, and the Cardinal <hi>Lodoviſio</hi> to his Confeſſor and principal Miniſters, repreſenting; <hi>That to</hi> Italy, <hi>nay rather to all Chriſtendom, there could not be an appearance of a greater calamity by War, in which, amidſt the zeal of Religion, military Licence would ſlip in with the contempt of Laws, both divine and humane, it being impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for impiety it ſelf and injuſtice to carrry on a War by honeſt rules and innocent means.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There arrived at this time in <hi>Rome</hi> an Embaſſy from the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> which according to the pious cuſtom of Catholick Princes is called of obedience, and conſiſted of four chief Senators, that is to ſay, <hi>Girolamo Juſtiniano</hi> Procurator, <hi>Anthonio Grimani, Franceſco Contarini</hi> Cavalier, Procurator, and <hi>Girolamo Soranzo</hi> Cavalier; the which, beſides the accuſtomed offices, had order to inſiſt much upon the buſineſs of the <hi>Valteline.</hi> But <hi>Gregory,</hi> by a diverſion from that chief point, required with great earneſt, that the Republick would re-admit into their State again thoſe religious people of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which for important cauſes, in the time of his Predeceſſor, had been baniſhed, which being repugnant to many Laws and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, the indiſſoluble bonds of Government, he could not obtain. Nevertheleſs the Marqueſs <hi>de Coevre,</hi> in quality of Ambaſſadour Extraordinary, paſſing from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> with the buſineſs bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter laid, preſſes it home in the Name of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> and at the ſame time the Biſhop of <hi>Monte Fiaſcone,</hi> Nuntio Apoſtolico, with a Brief from the Pope, and Letters from the Cardinal <hi>Lodoviſio,</hi> did ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly ſecond the importunity. But the Senate did not depart from their firſt conception, remonſtrating to the foreſaid Miniſters their Decrees and grave Conſiderations, by reaſon whereof Princes in amity with them ought not to preſs them to that, which was neither permitted to them to grant, nor could they deny without doing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to themſelves. Some took upon them to judge, that this demand had its riſe from a higher account and more ſecret ends, it having perhaps been the aim of ſome, to render the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53750:90"/>
it was ſuppoſed would not have given their conſent, either diſtruſted by the new Pope, or little acceptable to <hi>France</hi> at a time when it was needful to gain the good diſpoſition of the one, for the affairs in agitation, and to manage confederations and adjuſtments with the other. In the mean time the hinge of the buſineſs of the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> being fixed in <hi>Rome,</hi> with various turnings, paſſing alſo to other Courts, <hi>Feria</hi> manages his buſineſs more happily, planting Forts at <hi>Morbegno, Sondrio,</hi> and <hi>Tirano</hi> to eſtabliſh himſelf in poſſeſſion. Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Rhetia</hi> inceſſant diviſions, the effect was, that he at laſt gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>la Lega Griſa</hi> by Rams of gold which equally over-turn Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and the hearts of thoſe people, perſwading them to ſend ſix Ambaſſadours to <hi>Milan.</hi> The Government being in this manner divided, he could not have ſafer Hoſtages of their Venality, and of the ruine of that unhappy Country. To give it the laſt blow, with four of the Ambaſſadours, the other two diſſenting, he concludes a Treaty, by which the Cuſtody of the Forts was yielded to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> the Paſſes were to be open to them, they with a ſhew of words reſerving to themſelves in appearance the ancient Alliance with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Feria,</hi> promiſing aſſiſtance, if the other two diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leagues ſhould not confirm the Treaty. This Monſter of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Intereſt was without form, begotten by an illegitimate Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but which nevertheleſs ſerved for an advantage to <hi>Feria's</hi> deſigns, to put the <hi>Griſons</hi> into confuſion, to remain in the Valley, and diſcompoſe whatſoever might be reſolved elſewhere. <hi>Gheffier</hi> attempted to oppoſe himſelf, but in vain, the name of the <hi>French</hi> being either deteſted by the party moſt oppreſſed, or deſpiſed by that already ſold to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scaramuccia</hi> Viſconti going hereupon into <hi>Rhetia,</hi> in the name of the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> with money and promiſes, ſome of the Commons of the <hi>Griſa</hi> failed not to adhere to the foreſaid accord, induced thereto beſides from the fear of ſome Colours of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Switzers,</hi> who at the inſtance of <hi>Feria,</hi> being entred into that Country, oppreſſed it with Quarters. And the Canton of <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich</hi> in oppoſition to them kept Souldiers in the other two Leagues; but eſteeming no miſchief greater than charge, theſe would have been long before diſbanded, if the <hi>Venetians</hi> with ten thouſand Florins a month had not kept them on foot. With this incouragement <hi>la Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dé</hi> and the Directorſhips took Arms, pretending by forcible reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to keep the <hi>Griſa</hi> in the ancient Union. <hi>Pompeo Pianta,</hi> the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed chief Contriver of the diſagreements, was killed, and Viſconti with many of the Faction of <hi>Spain,</hi> were forced to retire in great haſte out of the Country; becauſe to the firſt fury of that inraged people, nothing being able to reſiſt, the Catholick <hi>Switzers</hi> alſo with their Colonel <hi>Betlinger</hi> retired, leaving Cannon and Baggage behind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>La Lega Griſa</hi> then joyned themſelves to the other; but <hi>Feria</hi> in hopes, which quickly vaniſhed, to keep the Torrent of theſe armed people far from the Valley, did not only ſtrengthen the Forts, but to facilitate the gaining of <hi>Chiavena,</hi> cauſed an Invaſion to be made
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53750:90"/>
into the Valley of <hi>Muſocco,</hi> which alone of the three Leagues is ſituate on this ſide the Mountains. The Inhabitants, though Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, yet for all that not inclined to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> having cold and ice for the defence of their ſituation, hid themſelves behind a great Trench of Snow, whence ſallying without being obſerved, they ſo unexpectedly charged the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, that leaving five hundred dead upon the place, they retired diſperſed by ſeveral ways into the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus every day were their minds as well as Troops more and more imbrued in blood, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> finding in the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> more apprehenſion of the evil than reſolution for the remedy, had recourſe again to the King of <hi>England,</hi> by the means of <hi>Girola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Lando</hi> ordinary Ambaſſadour, repreſenting to him the ſtate of things to be in a condition of great contingency. <hi>James</hi> with wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed magnificence of words anſwers; <hi>That he took to heart the ſecurity and ſafety of</hi> Europe. <hi>That the Intereſts of</hi> Italy <hi>were always in his eye and in his cares. That he held the Republick above all in a choice confidence and conſtant friendſhip. And did therefore declare, that if his Son-in-law were deſpoiled of his Patrimonial Countries, he would ſend a powerful Army into</hi> Germany <hi>to uphold him. If the</hi> Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <hi>ſhould be invaded, he would not ſpare his aſſiſtance; and if the</hi> Venetians <hi>ſhould ſuffer any moleſtation, he would ſuccour them with the Forces of all his Kingdoms, and for an earneſt offered a preſent Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy in</hi> England <hi>of ten thouſand Souldiers.</hi> The Senate by Letters expreſs renders him thanks in abundance, eſteeming thoſe magnificat offers for a grace, if not an aſſiſtance. It was now no ſecret, that at this time the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves kept the King in hope of the Marriage of <hi>Mary,</hi> ſecond Daughter of <hi>Philip,</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> to the end to make him ſuſpected by all, and beget a belief in himſelf, that the reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> ſhould be one of the chief Articles in that agreement. He nevertheleſs at <hi>Madrid</hi> preſſes alſo effectually for the reſtitution of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and <hi>Baſſompiere,</hi> arriving thereupon, purſues the ſame, the Popes Nuntio alſo and the Ambaſſadour of the <hi>Venetians</hi> contributing thereto their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.</p>
               <p>But the death of <hi>Philip</hi> the Third leaves for ſome days the buſineſs in ſuſpence. The face of the Court was a little before this much changed; for although <hi>Lerma,</hi> with the Purple of a Cardinal, had thought to cover himſelf from changes and accidents, yet it being difficult by honeſt means to maintain the aſcendant over the Genius of Princes, he eſcaped not the accuſtomed malignant influence of Envy and of Fortune. Publick diſcourſes ran abroad, that he had with poyſon procured the death of the Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of <hi>Roderigo Calderone,</hi> who had a power over her mind, equal to that which he exerciſed over the will of the King. The diſorders in the Government being over and above imputed to him, and in many things calumny, envy, and the intereſt of a few being joyned to what was true, his diſgrace, from the hatred of all was fiercely promoted. Having for ſome time ſince wreſtled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53750:91"/>
in this narrow path of the ambition of Court, he met with no more fierce Competitor, than the Duke <hi>D'<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ceda</hi> his own Son, cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oyned up with Father <hi>Luigio Aliaga,</hi> he Kings Confeſſor; ſo that there was not a corner that was not cunningly beſet, even to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward retirement of Conſcience, and the moſt ſecret Colloquies of the Soul. The King at laſt yields to the general deſire of the Court and Kingdoms, and in honour of the Purple ſilencing his accuſations, commands him to retire. It remained a doubt, whether in an age, proclaimed by the wrath of Heaven, to the mocquery of Favourites, the King would not have taken upon himſelf the Government, when death, in the forty third year of his age, takes him away from the troubles which Empire carries with it. His years would ſurely have been more memorable, if he had been born a private man ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a King; becauſe being better adorned with the ornaments of life, than endowed with the ſkill to command, as goodneſs, pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and continuance placed him in a degree higher than ordinary Subjects, ſo the diſapplication to Government rendred him lower than was fit or neceſſary. By publick defects, private vertues being corrupted, and in particular keeping his mind in idleneſs, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that he had reſerved nothing for himſelf to do, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all that which the Favourite had a mind to. Thus the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, recommended to Princes as to the true Shepherds, falls into mercenary hands, making themſelves not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood but by the ſound voice of intereſt, and the authority of ambition, the people ſuffer ruine and calamity, and the Princes themſelves render account to God of that Talent, which they have ſuffered their Miniſters to make merchandize of. It is certain, that <hi>Philip</hi> in the agony of death, was not ſo much comforted with the calling to mind his innocent life, as he was troubled with the ſting of conſcience for his omiſſions in Government. The report was, that the Maxims of Intereſt yielding in that inſtant to the Law of God, the reſtitution of the <hi>Valteline</hi> was preciſely ordered.</p>
               <p>The Son, <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, comes to the Kingdom in an age ſo young, being but ſixteen years old, that the World had cauſe heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to obſerve, whether ambition, the common diſeaſe of Princes, would ſooner move or ſatiate him. But it quickly appeared, that the Aſcendant of Favourites was not yet ſet; for diſpatches being brought to the King, he delivers them to <hi>Gaſparo di Guſman,</hi> Conde <hi>d'Olivares,</hi> and he ſhewing himſelf backward, though he deſired it, commanded they ſhould be given to whom the Count would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. He feigning modeſty, aſſigns them to <hi>Balthaſar di Zuniga,</hi> an old Miniſter, and of great credit, but yet by concert; for <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niga</hi> being his Uncle, they had agreed to ſupport one another; whereupon taking off the Maſk, the Power fell to the Count, who quickly honoured beſides with the Title of Duke, will be found with this double attribute in the following relation to be more famous than fortunate.</p>
               <p>From the Republick, according to cuſtom, were appointed an extraordinary Embaſſy to the King <hi>Simeon Contarini</hi> Cavalier, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53750:91"/>
and <hi>Girolamo Soranzo</hi> Cavalier. But <hi>Baſſompiere,</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An. Dom. </seg>1620</label> the time being paſſed which the change of Princes neceſſarily carries with it, ſollicites the affair of the <hi>Valteline</hi> in ſuch ſort, that it was the 25. of <hi>April</hi> concluded, <hi>That the Armies ſhould be withdrawn out of the Valley, and the Countries adjacent, and Religion with every other thing, as it was before the year</hi> 1617, <hi>reſtored;</hi> France, <hi>the Catholick</hi> Switzers, <hi>and the</hi> Valeſians <hi>obliging themſelves caution for it. To execute that much which was to be done, there was to be a Meeting in</hi> Lucerna <hi>of the Miniſters of the Pope, of</hi> France, <hi>and the Archduke</hi> Albert <hi>in the Name of King</hi> Philip. <hi>The ancient Treaties of</hi> Rhetia <hi>with the Houſe of</hi> Auſtria <hi>and with</hi> Tirol <hi>were to remain untouched.</hi> Some other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles in favour of paſſage for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſecretly added, which at that time were not known. That notwithſtanding, which was publiſhed, was more than ſufficient to make it underſtood, that both the Crowns conſpired in one and the ſame thing, which was to ſeek to delay the buſineſs; for <hi>France,</hi> the agitation of civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords not yet well ſetled, cared not ſo ſuddenly to involve it ſelf in thoſe of Strangers; and <hi>Spain,</hi> in the inſtant of the new Reign, thought it wiſe counſel to defer the War, and diſſemble a Peace. The Treaty, to ſay truth, contained but a huddle of things, little having been decided, and all remitted to new Conferences. And therefore, although in <hi>Madrid</hi> were publiſhed poſitive Orders to <hi>Feria,</hi> that he ſhould withdraw his Arms, and reſtore; the effect ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs did not appear; ſome aſcribing it to accidents ſuggeſted from more ſecret counſels, and the more ſimple reproaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Milan,</hi> as if he ſo tenderly loved the fruit of his own contrivance, as not to be willing to part with it. But in Treaties faith will fail as long as intereſt lives, and intereſt will be found as long as Princes reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feria,</hi> notwithſtanding the advices of Peace, arms ſtill more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, and in <hi>Germany</hi> the Archduke <hi>Leopold,</hi> interdicting Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce to the <hi>Griſons</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> raiſed Souldiers, threatning the latter with Jealouſies, and the other with War. Thus the Mine ſprung with great eaſe; for the Archduke having poſſeſſed himſelf of the Valley of <hi>Munſter,</hi> while the <hi>Griſons</hi> demanded the reſtitution, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Peace of <hi>Madrid</hi> ſo newly concluded, denies to be bound to obſerve it, he having had no Miniſter there, nor given his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and deſired that Deputies might be ſent to <hi>Felkirch,</hi> to the end, that by an amicable accord thoſe cauſes and ſuſpicions might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, which had moved him to poſſeſs it. The Preſident <hi>Dole,</hi> in the Name of the Archduke <hi>Albert,</hi> being arrived at the meeting in <hi>Lucerna,</hi> pretends to be treated as repreſenting <hi>Philip,</hi> ſtirring up the diſpute of Precedence with the <hi>French,</hi> which expreſly the Articles of <hi>Madrid</hi> by deſigning a Miniſter of the Archdukes had aimed to divert. During the delays to overcome this difficulty by writing, came new Orders, <hi>Albert</hi> dyes, and with him the Preſidents full power failing, the Conference diſſolves. Neither were other hinderances wanting, <hi>Feria</hi> declaring himſelf, that he would not execute the Treaty without the caution of the Catholick Cantons,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53750:92"/>
capitulated not ſo much for their power, as for their neighbourhood, and the dominion they have of paſſages. But they would not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe betwixt two ſo powerful Monarchs, and the common opinion then being that <hi>Feria</hi> himſelf did ſtrengthen them in that reſiſtance. He alſo puts thoſe of the <hi>Valteline</hi> upon ſending Deputies to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi> to make a clamour that Religion was not ſufficiently provided for, and he accompanies them with Letters from the Senate of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> in which with motives of piety and Religion were mingled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of convenience and advantage. He offers afterwards to make a ſhew only that the Forts ſhould be kept by the <hi>Catholick Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> but that the Proteſtants ſhould not abide in the Valley, till the Treaty ſhould be mended, and at the ſame time ſuggeſts under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to the <hi>Griſons</hi> vain hopes of having again the <hi>Valteline,</hi> if point blanck it ſhould not be otherwiſe conditioned, by ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, in which the paſſages ſhould be left free for <hi>Spain.</hi> But it was not in the power of the <hi>Griſons</hi> to alter what was agreed in <hi>Madrid</hi> betwixt the two Crowns.</p>
               <p>All this while there arrived not a Courrier out of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> but orders to the Duke were publiſhed for reſtoring and diſarming, with an expreſs command beſides to haſten Souldiers for the Fleet, whilſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> unſucceſsfully involved in the War of <hi>Poland,</hi> and in the <hi>Black Sea</hi> employed in repelling the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> left the <hi>White</hi> open to whatſoever attempts of the Chriſtians. But <hi>Feria,</hi> and the other Miniſters having their minds more fixed on advantages in <hi>Italy,</hi> than progreſs againſt the Turks, ſuch diſcourſes had no other end, but to raiſe a jealouſie in the <hi>Venetians,</hi> as if within the boſom of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> ſome ſurpriſes and acquiſitions were to be attempted in <hi>Albania;</hi> but the Fleet lying idle in <hi>Meſſina,</hi> more numerous in Ships than provided with men, the apprehenſion the Republick received from that ſide was but little and ſhort.</p>
               <p>But towards <hi>Lombardy</hi> jealouſies did increaſe, becauſe betwixt diſtruſtful Neighbours, either accidents frequently cauſe diſcord, or the more powerful ſeeks pretexts. And ſo a conteſt and almoſt a breach aroſe for a very narrow way which is called the <hi>Steccato,</hi> which to the Territory of <hi>Bergamo</hi> joins that of <hi>Crema,</hi> imbayed and environed on all ſides with the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi> By moſt ancient contracts with the City of <hi>Milan,</hi> it is the abſolute and undoubted Dominion of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> but for convenience and ſhortning of way, a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage remains open, not only for paſſengers, but was wont to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Souldiers, when paſſage was demanded from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of <hi>Crema.</hi> Now it hapned, that a Company of Horſe ſent by <hi>Feria</hi> to <hi>Soncino,</hi> attempted to paſs without leave, with the flying Colours advanced, and Arms uncovered; but was hindred by the Guards. <hi>Feria</hi> in great wrath, and taking it for an affront to the Kings Colours, ſends ſtore of Troops to the Confines, publiſhing, that he would paſs with a good Body of men without leave. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> making equal proviſions ordered <hi>Nicolo Contarini,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor beyond the <hi>Mincio,</hi> that he ſhould hinder him with all his force. They at the ſame time offered the paſs, when according to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53750:92"/>
cuſtom it ſhould be demanded,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An. Dom. </seg>1621</label> and propounded that the Contracts might be examined by Commiſſioners on both ſides. They wrote alſo to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> inveighing againſt <hi>Feria,</hi> that by raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcontents, and preferring idle tales before the merit of buſineſs, he aimed only to diſturb the quiet. The <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Grand Duke</hi> ſeriouſly conſidering, that from a ſmall cauſe worſe accidents might ariſe, employed their exhortations with the Governour of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> to give place for a compoſure, ſince the <hi>Venetians</hi> did not appear averſe to conſent, that that Company ſhould now paſs, but without doing prejudice to the right of either party, that afterwards that might be determined by Commiſſioners, which right required. <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> deputes two Senators, which were <hi>l' Areſe</hi> and <hi>Salamanca,</hi> to treat with <hi>Giacomo Vandramino</hi> Reſident of the Republick, and they would quickly have been agreed amongſt themſelves, that the Paſs ſhould have remained free for a certain time, within which the buſineſs ſhould have been quietly ſetled, if the Duke, rejecting a while after all ſort of handling, had not referred it to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and as though nothing but management of Arms had belonged to him, he had not ſent ſeventeen Companies of Horſe with ſome Foot to attempt the Paſs by force; but finding it well guarded, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> thought it beſt to make a halt. Many believed that in the heart of <hi>Italy</hi> there would from this little ſpark have been kindled a Fire, which might have prevented that, which upon <hi>Rhetia</hi> was foreſeen to be but too imminent.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pope</hi> wrote briefs to the Republick; and orders <hi>Scappi</hi> his Nuntio in <hi>Lucerna</hi> to go to <hi>Milan</hi> to mediate; but he no ſooner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives, but there riſing, as it happens in times of jealouſie, one acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or another, he found that for a conteſt only about Confines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the States of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Bozzolo, Feria</hi> was upon ſending to the latter Souldiers and aſſiſtance, which could not be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incenſing the Neighbours and ſtirring up the <hi>Venetians.</hi> From this he ſucceeded to divert him; but for the way, it was agreed to expect Commiſſions from <hi>Spain,</hi> where what had happened being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as it deſerved, more calmly, and the Governour <hi>Caimo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deputed to treat with <hi>Luigi Cornaro,</hi> Ambaſſador of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, it was at laſt by the interpoſition of the <hi>Nuntio</hi> agreed, that the company being ſent again ſhould paſs without prejudice to the rights of either; and alſo that the difference ſhould be terminated within the ſpace of four Months, by Commiſſioners upon the place. And ſo in a curſory manner it was punctually performed. But <hi>Luigi Mocenigo</hi> Governour of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> and the Senator <hi>Piccinardi</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in quality of Commiſſioners, could not agree in a total deciſion of the matter, it ſeeming, that where Confines are in diſpute, force hath greater place than reaſon, and is more in uſe; howſoever in the courſe of the preſent ſuſpicions, the paſſage was no more attempted by Souldiers in Arms, and within a while Affairs and mens minds ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the former quiet, reſpect and good correſpondence quickly began again. This compoſure hapned in the following year: But in this preſent upon the Borders of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> there was a certain light
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53750:93"/>
encounter; upon the occaſion that a Chain, laid by the <hi>Venetians</hi> over the River <hi>Oglio,</hi> which hindred the tranſport of Corn, becauſe of the ſcarcity of that years Harveſt, was looſned by people in Arms, and they of <hi>Seniga</hi> coming to hinder it, ſome of each ſide were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome hurt; which nevertheleſs, being reciprocally taken, as done rather by the tranſport of the Borderers, than the command of the Princes, was eaſily appeaſed. All notwithſtanding ſerving to diſturb mens minds, and adding as conſiderations to thoſe which the Affairs of the <hi>Valteline</hi> carried in too great meaſure with them, the <hi>Venetians</hi> had agreed with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> that he ſhould leavy four thouſand men, to the end that from the ſide of <hi>Piedmont</hi> they might make ſome ſeaſonable diverſion when there ſhould be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</p>
               <p>That nevertheleſs was not performed by the Duke, though the Republick had disburſed their part of the charge; for <hi>Carlo</hi> in the vaſtneſs of his mind, embracing many things, and always novelty of projects, had ſuffered himſelf to be perſwaded by <hi>Feria</hi> to ſurpriſe <hi>Geneva,</hi> poſſeſſed formerly by the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by himſelf. For that purpoſe, the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> had not only offered him aſſiſtance, but ſent certain Troops towards <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> to be at his diſpoſe, both to divert him from the Affairs of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and alſo give jealouſie to thoſe of <hi>Bearn,</hi> and the other Proteſtant <hi>Switzers,</hi> Protectors of that City, that they might think no more of the <hi>Griſons.</hi> Nor did the deſign fail, for the intention of <hi>Carlo,</hi> from the moving of Troops out of the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, thoſe <hi>Cantons</hi> were in ſuch a combuſtion, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently recalled out of <hi>Rhetia</hi> all aſſiſtance and conſideration of it. The <hi>Venetians</hi> therefore reſolved to interpoſe, and having procured <hi>Carlo</hi> to give his word, that he would not moleſt that City, they carried it to the <hi>Switzers</hi> to quiet them. Nor was <hi>Carlo</hi> very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult in that promiſe; becauſe the plot being diſcovered, <hi>Geneva</hi> was in defence, and the Neighbours were ſo ready with aſſiſtance, that the enterpriſe could not ſucceed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feria</hi> then recals his Souldiers, and oppoſes himſelf more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> who, weary of their own calamities, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in a <hi>Pittach</hi> at <hi>Coira</hi> by forcible means to get out of them, ſending Souldiers down into the <hi>Valteline,</hi> to try the utmoſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their ſtrength. But the enterpriſe was ſo ill managed, that it ſeemed a Monſter begotten of deſpair; for that it was an Army compoſed of the meaneſt ſort of people, without Commanders, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Counſel, without Proviſions and Money, and in a manner without Arms, and abounded in nothing but temerity, confuſion, and inraged madneſs. Thoſe that ſided with the <hi>Venetians</hi> diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, as unſeaſonable; but the Emiſſaries of <hi>Feria</hi> and his Faction had put them upon it, to give a more apparent pretext for the non-obſervance of the Treaty at <hi>Madrid.</hi> Six thouſand men divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three Bodies fiercely deſcended into the County of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mio.</hi> One of them poſſeſſes certain Trenches abandoned by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that kept it, fearing an attacque from behind them. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53750:93"/>
entred into the Town of <hi>Primai,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Bormio.</hi> The third at the Bridge of <hi>Santa Lucia,</hi> maſtering the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of gain <hi>Chiappina,</hi> and the Paſs of <hi>Monbray,</hi> which ſhuts up the way that comes from <hi>Venoſta.</hi> Altogether ſtopped the Paſſes which could bring ſuccours to the Fort of <hi>Bormio,</hi> where they lodged in the Town, diſſipating thoſe few which they found within it; but the Cannon from the Fort kindling a Fire in it, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to go out into the Campagnia, and the Guards of the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, being preſſed by hunger, to abandon them in diſorder, to provide themſelves of Victuals, gave opportunity to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to poſſeſs them. At the ſame time that they attacqued them in Front, they were aſſaulted in the Reer by the Colonel <hi>Baldirone,</hi> who, with fifteen hundred Souldiers of <hi>Leopolds,</hi> from the ſide of <hi>Tirol</hi> came down by the way of <hi>Monbray,</hi> and the Garriſon of the Fort making a ſally, the <hi>Griſons</hi> who alſo had want of ammunition, were ſo encompaſſed, that deſpair or courage would not have been able to have ſaved them, if the darkneſs of the night covering them, had not facilitated the means to many of hiding themſelves in the Mountains, and from thence in ſmall Troops to retire home. After this ſucceſs, <hi>Serbellone,</hi> with a greater Force ſupplied him from the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> eaſily poſſeſſes <hi>Chiavena,</hi> and <hi>Baldirone</hi> makes himſelf maſter of the Valley of <hi>Partentz, Poſchiavo,</hi> and many other Towns and places of the <hi>Agnedina,</hi> and of the Ten Directorſhips. <hi>Rhetia</hi> by theſe redoubled invaſions, was full of confuſion and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nevertheleſs a <hi>Pittach</hi> was held in <hi>Coira,</hi> which, if it proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways tumultuous, was at preſent void of all order and form, every one pretending to give counſel to other, and no man knowing what was fit to reſolve.</p>
               <p>There was a great conteſt about ſending new Ambaſſadors to <hi>Milan,</hi> many approved it, and the Ten Directorſhips oppoſed it: when <hi>Leopolds</hi> Army coming to <hi>Coira,</hi> reſolves the doubt and the meeting; for the people in a fright went out to meet them, and renders them the Town, ſaving their Priviledges, Government, and Liberty of Conſcience. Certain it was, that the Arch Duke deſired to have it, and preſſed the Biſhop to renounce the Church to him, to which are annexed many temporal juriſdictions, and the dominion of one part of the Town it ſelf. In the mean time, to hinder the <hi>Switzers</hi> from ſuccouring <hi>Rhetia,</hi> he cauſes a good Fort to be laid towards <hi>Regatz,</hi> ſlighting the jealouſies of the <hi>Cantons</hi> and their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, whilſt not being able to reſolve any thing, but by an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent, they were obliged firſt to call a Diet for it. And becauſe <hi>Feria</hi> apprehended ſome motion from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to keep the chief ſtrength of their Forces in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> he ſends a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men to their Borders. But there appeared a kind of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Affairs, from whence it was leaſt expected; for <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> who ſought War every where, and his profit from every accident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarcely diſ-intangled from the loſſes of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> with a ſpeedy march comes into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> with ſo great a diverſion, and ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53750:94"/>
that he not only obliges <hi>Leopold</hi> to haſten thither with all his Forces, but <hi>Feria</hi> to ſend thither (having the convenience of the paſſes, and of the new Conqueſts) four thouſand Foot, and five hundred Horſe, leſſening the Garriſons and the jealouſies towards the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and in particular taking ſome Companies out of <hi>Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cino,</hi> the which in reſpect to the Paſs of the <hi>Steccato,</hi> went round about the Territory of <hi>Crema.</hi>

            <p>CErtainly the <hi>Valteline</hi> and <hi>Rhetia</hi> were not taken to be of little conſequence, as not to deſerve the care of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, both as to the ſeizing and defending of them; ſuch being their ſituation, that being poſſeſſed by Strangers, a ſnare might be ſaid to be cloſed upon the relief and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> therefore, to whom it more nearly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, became more earneſt upon all occaſions in their offices and invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the <hi>French.</hi> But that Kingdom, involved in new inteſtine diſcords, ſtill languiſhed from its firſt diſtemper, and the remonſtrances or threats of the King were little feared by the <hi>Auſtrians.</hi> For <hi>Luines</hi> having formed a great deſign to take from the <hi>Hugenots</hi> the places, which former Kings, under the title of ſecurity, had for a time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to them, took pretext from a certain Aſſembly which they held in <hi>Rochel,</hi> that ſince the ſucceſſes in <hi>Bern,</hi> they complotted with over-much licence things prejudicial to the Kings ſervice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring it ſuſpect and unlawful, followed the Edicts with an Army. That Party was weakened enough already through diſ-union; for the Court had gained ſome of the chief ones, who preferred their Intereſt before Religion, and amongſt thoſe <hi>Dediguieres;</hi> ſo that there remained no more Chiefs of Authority amongſt them, but <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han, Soubize, Chaſtiglione,</hi> and <hi>la Force,</hi> of ſeveral inclinations, and divers ends amongſt themſelves. Many of the people deſired peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rather than turbulent counſels, others adhered to the Chiefs, or
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53750:95"/>
followed the obſtinate zeal for their falſe belief. The Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſuppreſs them all, and, the ſooner to end the War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it with great force, and with ſeveral Armies diſperſed in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Provinces. With one the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon</hi> curbs <hi>Rochel;</hi> and with another, the Duke of <hi>Maine</hi> in his Government of <hi>Guyenne</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirms the Towns in obedience, or forces the diſobedient. <hi>Conde</hi> longſt the <hi>Loire</hi> takes <hi>Sancere,</hi> and the King with the moſt conſiderable part of his Forces beſieges S. <hi>Jean d' Angeli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Hugenots</hi> were not wanting to themſelves, ſome ſerving in perſon, others contributing money, notwithſtanding all help from without failed them, <hi>Germany</hi> being too much imbroiled, <hi>England</hi> not minding Foreign affairs; and <hi>Holland,</hi> ready to come to blows with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, had more need of <hi>French</hi> ſuccours, than were inclined to aſſiſt the Rebels of that Crown. They were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in many places obliged to ſubmit, and St. <hi>Jean d' Angeli,</hi> though defended by <hi>Soubize</hi> to the utmoſt, was forced at its ſurrender to accept of any conditions, and to have the Walls razed. Such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſuch a place was of marvellous uſe to the <hi>Hugenots</hi> to blunt the firſt fury of the Kings Army, which, having rather done honour to ſome obſcure places than overcome them, ſate down at laſt before <hi>Montauban,</hi> a good deal weakened, and not ſo fierce. This was a very memorable Siege, becauſe the place wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fortifications, Commanders, Proviſions, and Garriſon; nor the Aggreſſors Force, Diſcipline, and Courage. All Arts and Force of War were there practiſed; there were to be ſeen diverſions attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ambuſhes laid, ſuccours brought in, and ſometimes repulſed, thundering batteries, aſſaults with more raſhneſs than bravery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken and repulſed, with the ſhedding of noble blood, in ſuch ſort that the Ditches of <hi>Montauban</hi> were the burying place of the moſt worthy and valiant Souldiers. But at laſt ſome being weary, others diſbanded, moſt dead, the Army was much weakened, and the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo far advanced, that the King was forced to raiſe the Siege, and withdrawing to Winter-quarters in <hi>Guiena,</hi> expect the taking in of ſome ſmall places; where <hi>Luines,</hi> by favour aſſumed into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Charge of <hi>Conſtable,</hi> ſurpriſed with a dangerous ſickneſs, ends his days; worthy in this of great praiſe, that he at leaſt rough-hewed the great deſign of uniting all <hi>France</hi> unto it ſelf, which was afterwards more happily perfected by others.</p>
            <p>Theſe Ingagements of <hi>France</hi> contributed much to advantage the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſigns, who with various Arts laboured to continue them longer intangled in the ſame; whereupon making ſhew of friendſhip and zeal of Religion, they offer ſuccours to ſubdue the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and particularly a Fleet to conquer <hi>Rochel.</hi> And indeed, not only the <hi>Valteline,</hi> but in all parts elſe, the Arms of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> went proſperouſly on, ſcarce finding oppoſition; for in <hi>Bohemia</hi> there remaining but <hi>Tabor</hi> and <hi>Pilſen,</hi> which held for <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick,</hi> the firſt was by <hi>Tilli,</hi> who corrupted the Commanders, won with gold, and the other by <hi>Marradas</hi> after a very long Siege. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia</hi> was quickly brought under by the Elector of <hi>Saxe;</hi> and <hi>Hungary,

Gabor</hi> having in vain ſought ſuccours from the <hi>Turks</hi> and the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> was forced to receive a Peace and Laws, <hi>Bethlem</hi> having laid down the Title of King, and reſtored the Crown, with the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſeven Counties in <hi>Hungary</hi> it ſelf, and two large Dukedoms in <hi>Sileſia.</hi>

            <p>There remained both the <hi>Palatinates,</hi> higher and lower, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of <hi>Frederick,</hi> in whoſe name <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> yet making War, was, as hath been ſaid, entred into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> doing the Biſhoprick of <hi>Spira</hi> and other places on the <hi>Rhine</hi> intolerable miſchiefs, and in <hi>Alſatia</hi> it ſelf, taking <hi>Haghenau,</hi> and with a ſtrait but vain Siege attempted <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bern.</hi> In favour alſo of <hi>Frederick</hi> ſome other Generals of Armies diſcovered themſelves, who, in imitation of <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with ſecret aſſiſtance from other Princes, to ſtruggle with the Power and Fortune of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> One was <hi>John George,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Jagendorf,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who, by reaſon of the Reformation of Religion, which the Imperialiſts in the ſubdued Provinces executed with ſo much ſeverity, that it ſeemed to many a ſlaughter rather than a remedy or chaſtiſement, aſſembled many of the male-contents and ſome Souldiers to infeſt <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia.</hi> Another was <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> Duke of <hi>Branſwich</hi> and Adminiſtrator of <hi>Halberſtat,</hi> who taking into his ſervice ſome Troops of the King of <hi>Denmarks,</hi> for that purpoſe diſbanded, and having formed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Army, haraſſed <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and the Catholicks of thoſe parts. <hi>Frederick,</hi> weary of the vexations of a Crown ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and now deſperate, being retired into <hi>Holland,</hi> gave way, that under the protection of the King of <hi>England</hi> his Intereſt ſhould be managed in the Imperial Court, and that the <hi>Palatinate</hi> ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But the offices of <hi>James</hi> were diſcredited by the weakneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he accompanied his force; whereupon, under pretext that the buſineſs of the Peace and pardon of <hi>Frederick</hi> was to be deferred to a general Diet, as was deſired not only by <hi>England,</hi> but by <hi>Denmark</hi> and the <hi>Lower Saxony,</hi> the Army of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> marched. Upon <hi>Spinola's</hi> coming near the <hi>Rhine</hi> with an Army well ordered and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, the Princes Proteſtants of the Union being frighted, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to a Treaty in <hi>Mentz,</hi> by which their Union being diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which conſiſted more in name than in a true concord of minds, they reſolved to ſtand neutral, and <hi>Spinola</hi> on the other ſide promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſo to reſpect them. In the <hi>Palatinate</hi> there being now, and that but with a very few Troops, only Colonel <hi>Veer,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, and <hi>Obentrauta German,</hi> it would have been eaſie for <hi>Spinola</hi> to have poſſeſſed it, if out of fear to have too much irritated the King of <hi>England,</hi> and a deſire he had to attempt ſome Exploit upon the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> he had not conſented to a Truce for ſome months. A Truce highly diſapproved by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, but which being of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle continuance, advantaged them in the pretexts of their attempts, becauſe the Commanders of the Troops in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the ſuccours which <hi>Mansfelt</hi> and <hi>Halverſtat</hi> gave out they would bring them, having by a pernicious Council broken it, awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53750:96"/>
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſeparated into Quarters, to aſſemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and beſiege <hi>Franckental,</hi> after having taken <hi>Stein,</hi> which was done by <hi>Gonzalo di Cordua, Spinola</hi> being elſewhere imployed.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> nevertheleſs ceaſed not by means of his Ambaſſadour <hi>Digby,</hi> at the Imperial Court to ſollicite the renewing the ſuſpenſion of Arms. But <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> impreſſed already with the thought of depriving <hi>Frederick</hi> of his Electorſhip and Country, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Treaty to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to gain time, and in that interim the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> in a manner provoked by <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> who with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Treaties for ſeveral months had deluded him, enters the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Palatinate,</hi> and poſſeſſes it without oppoſition, the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of Fortreſſes or Forces. And the Duke, not to be wanting to the occaſion and his own advantages, to purſue <hi>Mansfelt</hi> ſends <hi>Tilli</hi> to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and orders him to ſeize all that part of the <hi>Lower Palatinate,</hi> which lies betwixt the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Neccar.</hi> A blow which <hi>Maximilian</hi> believed doubly pleaſing to the Catholicks, not only becauſe it deprived the Hereticks of that very ſtrong Hold, but becauſe it prevented the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whom the <hi>Germans</hi> did not willingly ſee advanced into the Empire by ſuch Conqueſts. The King of <hi>England</hi> was inraged to ſee his Son-in-law oppreſſed, and himſelf deluded; but not having forces proportionable to his anger, and his Authority ſerving no longer for a ſufficient cover for his weakneſs, had called a Parliament, according to cuſtom, to conſider of Contributions and Proviſions. But grievous complaints were preſently ſtarted, ſome deſiring that the Treaty of Marriage betwixt the Prince and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> might be broken, and that a Wife might be given him of a Religion comformable to their own; others preſſing a Reformation in the Government, with pretenſions which were injurious to the Soveraignty, and oppoſite to the nature of it; ſo that he diſſolves it without coming to a reſolution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Palatinate</hi> then remained at the diſcretion of the Enemy-forces, nor was to expect other ſuccours but from <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> who, according to his cuſtom, with ſly marches and unexpected arrives there, ſo unlooked for, that <hi>Cordua</hi> taking fright, raiſes the Siege, retiring or rather running away by night, leaving in his Quarters ſick Souldiers, Materials, and Cannon. Thus ends this year famous for War, kindled in ſo many parts; and to the end no corner of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> might remain free from the flame, in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> alſo the Truce being expired, it fiercely breaks out again. Heretofore in the interval of greater Wars, that of <hi>Flanders</hi> ſerved the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Monarchy for a ſtanding Army, and to keep Military Diſcipline in exerciſe. But exerciſe it ſelf becoming violent and to exceſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the moſt vital ſpirits of the Crown; the Souldiers of <hi>Spain,</hi> the gold of the <hi>Indies,</hi> the vigour of <hi>Italy</hi> being not able to ſupply them. And therefore a Truce for twelve years was willingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed, and might eaſily again have been prolonged, if in <hi>Spain,</hi> at the expiration thereof, the counſels of thoſe had been continued who firſt ſetled it. But the <hi>Conde Duke,</hi> new in Government, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the young King remote from affairs, took the meaſure of his
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53750:96"/>
power from his own opinion and pride.<label type="milestone">

               <hi>Spinola</hi> then having conſented to a Truce in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> as hath been ſaid, marches to the Frontiers of the United Provinces, threatning many places. At laſt encamps his Army near to Prince <hi>Maurice of Orange,</hi> who was at <hi>Emerich</hi> to obſerve his motions, and having by a Stratagem induced him to draw a thouſand men out of <hi>Juliers,</hi> making a ſhew to attacque another place, turns to that, firſt inveſted by Count <hi>Henry Vanden Berg</hi> with ſix thouſand Foot, a thouſand Horſe, and ſix pieces of Cannon, and afterwards by <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> himſelf with the groſs, environed with Forts and deep Trenches.

Upon the motion of theſe Armies, the States ſent to ſeveral Courts for ſuccours, and demanded of the <hi>Venetians</hi> thoſe diſburſements, to which the League obliged, and which being comprehended in the Article ſtipulated of Invaſion, were by the Republick accordingly paid unto them.</p>

               <p>The Prince of <hi>Echemberg,</hi> Favourite and chief Miniſter of the Emperour, having in the end of the year paſt, in the name of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter eſpouſed, in <hi>Mantua, Eleonora Gonzaga,</hi> Siſter of the Duke, a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, which over and above her Portion brought rare Beauty and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Vertue; the moſt convenient paſſage for the Bride lying through the Territory of the <hi>Venetians</hi> about <hi>Trent,</hi> ſhe was received and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed by <hi>Andrea Paruta,</hi> General <hi>di Terra firma,</hi> by order of the Senate with ſuitable Magnificence. But at the ſame time the Count <hi>d'Ognate</hi> diſputed in <hi>Vienna</hi> the Rank and Dignity with <hi>Pietro Gritti,</hi> Ambaſſadour of the Republick, denying him the ſame Treatment and Title, which always formerly had been practiſed; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to whom <hi>Ognate</hi> in other reſpects had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficiently odious, ſhewed his great diſlike of it, yet the <hi>Spaniard</hi> perſiſting in his conceit, the Senate was neceſſitated to recal their Miniſter, leaving at the Court <hi>Marco Anthonio Padavino</hi> Secretary, till ſuch time that by the alteration of affairs, minds co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to change and be pacified, they might, as after a year or two happened, ſend again an Ambaſſadour to reſide there. Amidſt a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53750:97"/>
heap of ſo many croſs things, it ſerved for ſome kind of ſatisfaction, that in <hi>Naples</hi> the Vice-King, Cardinal <hi>Zappata,</hi> reſtored at laſt the Gallies formerly taken, with the Merchandize remaining undevour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Oſſuna,</hi> nothing was ſpoken of the remainder, nor more of the Ships; becauſe there having been much hurt done on either ſide, the liquidation would have been difficult. The Admiral Ship of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> was alone, as hath been ſaid, rendred by the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moleſtation at Sea ceaſed about this time; for <hi>Freletich,</hi> famous for many rapines and villanies, diſcharged out of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, was entertained by the Grand Duke in <hi>Ligorn;</hi> but being weary of quiet, and hungring after pillage, enters into the <hi>Adriatick</hi> to attempt in the <hi>Quarnaro,</hi> wonted ſurpriſals upon the Iſlands or Ships of <hi>Venetians;</hi> but being taken by the Men of War, paid at laſt with many of his Companions for his folly with his life. Amidſt foreign relations, domeſtick examples, and teſtimonies of the well regulated Diſcipline of the Common-wealth muſt not be omitted. It is forbidden the Sons of the Dukes, for important reaſons which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that temperance, which is moſt neceſſary among Citizens, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of the Father, to accept Benefices of the Church.</p>
               <p>It happened that the Pope conferred upon <hi>Mattheo,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Priu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> and he mindful of enjoying the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Country, and to uphold in his Father the chief Dignity of the Common-wealth, refuſed it with great applauſe of his Fellow-Citizens, and probably to the admiration of thoſe who know no other Law but that of Ambition and Intereſt. But amidſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſuch an example, another above meaſure abominable pollutes the City: For <hi>Anthonio Foſcarini</hi> Cavalier and Senator was ſeen hanged upon the Gallows, upon a calumny to have held a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Correſpondence with Strangers. The fraud of ſome of the wickedeſt of men, propoſing to themſelves rewards, had conſpired againſt the life of the moſt innocent and eminent Patricians; for as much as the Government in turbulent times calling to mind paſt Treacheries, and conſidering the preſent hatreds, ſuſpicions alone were eaſily diſguiſed into crimes. They addreſſed themſelves to the Magiſtrate of the greateſt Inquiſitors of State, and dividing the parts, ſome of Accuſers, others of Witneſſes, they betrayed Juſtice and the Juſt. But this infamous Conſpiracy could not laſt long; for the hainouſneſs of the offence being diſcovered, <hi>Girolamo Vano da Salo</hi> and <hi>Domenico da Venetia</hi> as the principal ſuffered juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Foſcarini,</hi> by a publick declaration of his innocency, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, if not to life, at leaſt to his good name, and his family to their former luſtre, and from common compaſſion promoted to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degrees of Honour.</p>
               <p>And now returning to the ſucceſſes of the <hi>French</hi> Armies, whoſe motion was depending alſo upon thoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> they proceeded againſt the <hi>Hugenots</hi> with ſome ſort of proſperity; for that <hi>Soubize</hi> being driven out of the Iſlands of <hi>Rochel,</hi> the King in the mouth of the Chanel planted the Fort <hi>Louis,</hi> which though it did not ſhut up the Town and Port, did nevertheleſs incommodate, and was afterward
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53750:97"/>
the foundation of that memorable Siege. The ſmall places of <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne</hi> and <hi>Languedock</hi> were all rendred, being ſo much the more weak as they were more numerous, whilſt the <hi>Hugenot</hi> Party, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of many, equal in authority no leſs than in intereſt, inſtead of ſtrengthening the vital and more noble parts, applied themſelves to the defence of obſcure places, which at the appearance of an Army or the firſt Volley of ſhot, were obliged to yield. But gaining the Chiefs of that Faction, turned to a far greater damage. <hi>La Force,</hi> upon a ſecret promiſe to be created Mareſhal of <hi>France</hi> abandons it, and <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> pretending to be ill ſatisfied with <hi>Rohan,</hi> retires him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Dediguieres</hi> declaring himſelf Catholick, obtained by it the Charge of Conſtable, which is the higheſt in the Armies; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by example and other benefits magnifying his own advantages, he drew many that conſidered, ſuch notable rewards were not to be had from other than the King. A Peace therefore with the <hi>Huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> being procured by the Ambaſſadours of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> to the end the King might apply himſelf to foreign occurrences, was diverted, the endeavours, beſides the allurements of preſent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, of the Apoſtolick Nuntio who wholly oppoſed himſelf againſt it, the artifice of the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> who craftily nouriſhed the diviſion, and the judgment of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who with great averſion to the belief, in which he was born, implacably ſollicited the War prevailing. But to the affairs of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> the greateſt ſtop was put by the inclination of <hi>Monſieur de Piſieux,</hi> Secretary of State, who ſucceeded to <hi>Luines</hi> in the favour, ſhewing himſelf irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in buſineſs, inconſtant in his word, and in all things a Miniſter of greater cunning than ability. He profeſſed great reſpect to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and in the affairs of the <hi>Griſons</hi> publiſhed himſelf above meaſure ſolicitous to terminate them by Negotiation; but particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with ambitious deſigns and hopes imbarking in the pretenſions of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> he procures the Expedition of the Ambaſſador <hi>Monſieur de Sillery,</hi> his Uncle, to <hi>Gregory,</hi> and aſſents ſo much the more willingly, that the ſeat of all that management ſhould be in that City. Amidſt theſe conſiderations the buſineſs languiſhed, and if upon the attempts of the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> and of <hi>Leopold,</hi> any complaint and threatning came forth from King <hi>Lewis,</hi> it quickly cooled again, being deluded by new projections; for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters making the tumultuary motions of the <hi>Griſons</hi> the excuſe of their Conqueſts, the Negotiation in <hi>Madrid</hi> being turned topſie turvy, referred the Treaty to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father reſiding, the Mediator of Peace, the Prince, who, for what concerned Religion, had the greateſt intereſt, ſhewed them ſelves always ready to execute whatſoever he, for the good and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the ſame, ſhould preſcribe.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time the buſineſs came to be diſturbed by new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; for in <hi>Madrid</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour conſents to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Writing to depoſite the Forts in the hands of the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and although at the beginning in <hi>France</hi> they ſeemed to oppoſe it, becauſe it made a rent in the firſt Treaty, the inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53750:98"/>
nevertheleſs of the Marqueſs of <hi>Mirabel,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> prevailed above the conſiderations of that of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which ſhewed the confounding of the buſineſs and the deluſion of the Propoſition; ſo that it was accepted with a change only of the perſon, truſted into, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> as more acceptable to the <hi>French.</hi> In <hi>Spain,</hi> time, mens minds, and the buſineſs being tired out with ſuch kind of proceedings, <hi>Feria</hi> in <hi>Milan</hi> precipitates himſelf with ſo much the more haſte, to conclude with ſome Ambaſſadours of the <hi>Griſons</hi> (thoſe of <hi>Switzers,</hi> who were come thither to aſſiſt the weakneſs of the others, being excluded from the Negotiation) three Treaties, one with the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> another with the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and a third with the Archduke. In which was agreed. <hi>The ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Ten Directorſhips to</hi> Leopold, <hi>a perpetual Confederation with the</hi> Milaneſe, <hi>openneſs and liberty of the paſſages to the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ancient Alliance with the Crown of</hi> France, <hi>and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of the</hi> Valteline <hi>from the Soveraignty of the</hi> Griſons; <hi>in place whereof twenty five thouſand Crowns were to be paid unto them.</hi> It was difficult to diſcern which in theſe conditions was greater, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of <hi>Feria,</hi> or the baſeneſs of the Ambaſſadours, only excuſable, that to diſpoſe of the Liberty and Dominion was not in their power. Nor did the Commonalty dare to oppoſe it; but being aſſembled in <hi>Ilants,</hi> ſuborned by fear and force, notwithſtanding the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> proteſted againſt it, they approved every tittle of it. The <hi>Venetians</hi> would not alone undergo the burden of redeeming the <hi>Griſons</hi> Liberty, whiles <hi>France</hi> involved themſelves in Treaties, but obſerving accidents and the iſſue of affairs, furniſh themſelves with all ſorts of proviſions; and the name of <hi>Mansfelt</hi> being famous for courage and a numerous Militia that depended on him, they agreed with him under the Title of General beyond the Mountains, and the yearly entertainment of twelve thouſand Ducats, though he were not in actual ſervice, that he ſhould be obliged to come to them when neceſſity required, and bring them twenty five thouſand Foot and five thouſand Horſe, which under the pay of the Republick were to be conducted by ſuch paſſages and to ſuch places, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to opportunity ſhould be concerted. This ſerved to make ſure of a Militia in exerciſe, and a General of reputation to make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, if, while <hi>Rhetia</hi> were oppreſſed, and ſuccours excluded, the Republick ſhould be invaded by the <hi>Auſtrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the affairs of the <hi>Griſons</hi> took a new aſpect, though not laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as it uſually happens, as much from the indiſcreet violence of him that oppreſſes, as from the inconſiderate licence of a people that riſe in commotion. Some of the Commons, no longer able to ſuffer the miſery they endured, fell into a Tumult, and in their fury ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of all ſorts of Weapons, with ſtaves and ſtones killed the Garriſons of the <hi>Auſtrians.</hi> In <hi>Sciers,</hi> where the Tumult began, a hundred Foot were cut to pieces, and in <hi>Grus</hi> three hundred more, with whoſe Arms the Mutineers being ſtrengthened, at <hi>Miolans</hi> a more numerous Party was ſlain. At the important Paſs of <hi>Steich</hi> towards <hi>Tirol</hi> were left ſix hundred men in guard, the others coming
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53750:98"/>
to <hi>Maianfelt</hi> and <hi>Coira</hi> gave ſuch incouragement to the Inhabitants, that they conſtrained the Garriſons to retire into the Caſtles, and render themſelves a little after with an obligation to ſet at liberty certain <hi>Griſons,</hi> which were then Priſoners in <hi>Tirol.</hi> Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers that were in Caſtles offered to render, ſaving their lives, but that people would give them no other conditions but from revenge to be cut in pieces. Thoſe of <hi>Tirol</hi> attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover <hi>Steich;</hi> but being repulſed, retrenched themſelves in number of ſix hundred cloſe to the Paſs; others from other parts of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> where they were in Garriſon, coming forth joyned to keep the field; but being through the knowledge of the ſituations over-matched by thoſe of that Country, were obliged to give way and retire with loſs. Upon ſo proſperous beginnings, driven on by that fury which the Spirit of Liberty ſuggeſted, the baniſhed appeared; and although <hi>Feria</hi> imployed all ſorts of offices, to the end the Catholick <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> would ſhut certain Paſſes, which are betwixt ſome of the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> where Dominion is promiſcuous, the Proteſtants ſent ſecretly ſuccours, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> at the perſwaſions of the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour with a greater warineſs ſupplied ſome money, that they might provide themſelves with Arms and Ammunition. To ſo great a Tumult <hi>Feria</hi> applies no other remedy but well to provide the places poſſeſſed: then having experienced more than once the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a Treaty and of time, believed, that the multitude, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſhould prevail in force, at laſt by devices of wit would eaſily be brought under. He then inſinuates a ſuſpenſion of Arms with the Archduke, <hi>Gheffier</hi> favouring it, being not yet gone out of that Country where his opinions had frequently been fatal. Some that were partial, ſpread it among the common people, and in the Aſſemblies, where the Popular triumphed with various diſcourſes of their own proweſs and their liberty regained; <hi>That now blood and revenge had been ſufficiently ſatisfied, that the ancient valour of</hi> Rhetia <hi>was gloriouſly recovered out of ignominy and ſlavery. That all enjoyed with applauſe the glory and liberty purchaſed with ſo much merit by a few. That a People could not render it ſelf more conſiderable to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, nor more dreadful to Neighbours, than to bring great Princes to be ſenſible of their miſdoings, and oblige them to juſt reſolutions. That now to hear them and adjuſt with them, a ſhort Truce was neceſſary, that might ſomewhat allay the boiling heat of mens minds, ſuſpend the ſharpneſs of the War, and divert accidents which might irritate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with prejudice, or alter the ſtate of things to the Wars. That it was neceſſary alſo to reform the Government ſo much diſordered by the late Commotions. And how could that be done, the Commons remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparate, and the beſt Patriots with their Arms in their hands di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed into ſeveral Poſts? Of whom then were they to be afraid? The</hi> Auſtrians <hi>being new driven away, and Liberty recovered; neither could ought elſe be pretended to be done but to preſerve it with good orders, and reſtoring the ancient Inſtitutions. That now Autumn and the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Winter did perſwade it; but that they ought to be doubly ſecured both by the ſeaſon and by faith. That the Propoſition came from the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53750:99"/>
Enemy but was approved by friends themſelves, and thought by the</hi> French <hi>Miniſters to be ſeaſonable.</hi>

               <p>Some were not wanting to adviſe them to dive into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of the Peace; <hi>That the deſigns of the</hi> Auſtrians <hi>were to caſt in a Remora to warlike proceedings. That the invincible Valour of the</hi> Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>had in many occaſions been taken notice of in the field, but their credulity as much diſcovered in Treaties, which ſpringing from the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of their faith, and the ſimplicity of their education, leaves them more expoſed to the deceivings of Wit than to the blows of the Sword. That the Archduke, though buſied in repelling</hi> Mansfelt, <hi>would neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs within a while turn his Arms and his Deſigns againſt unhappy</hi> Rhetia. <hi>To what purpoſe propound a Truce but to diſarm the people, ſeparate the Commons, and lull them aſleep in the falſe ſecurity of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? That their Liberty, laid in wait for, could not protect it ſelf better than by the jealouſies of fraud and the force of Arms. That they ſhould then believe themſelves more ſecure and defended from the</hi> Auſtrians, <hi>when they ſhould have more diſcovered them to be enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Affections, as is the wont of popular Governments, prevailed much more than reaſons, and thoſe which diſſented, being the few and the wiſer, the multitude on the other ſide ignorant of that which was in deliberation; the ſuſpenſion of Arms with <hi>Leopold</hi> was imbraced, in that inſtant that <hi>Mansfelt</hi> marching towards the Low Countries left him alſo free from his diſtractions. A Meeting after the Truce being held in <hi>Lindó</hi> under the name of fully eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the Peace, there met there the Deputies of the Archduke, thoſe of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> the Ambaſſadours of the <hi>Switzers, Caſati</hi> for <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Molina</hi> the Interpreter of <hi>France.</hi> But while the <hi>Griſons</hi> being diſbanded, reſted upon the ſecurity of that Treaty, <hi>Sults, Leopolds</hi> General, invades <hi>Rhetia,</hi> and having overcome the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the firſt Paſſes, though with ſome blood, poſſeſſes with one ſudden motion both the <hi>Agnedina's,</hi> the Valley of <hi>Partenz, Tava, Majanfelt,</hi> and <hi>Coira,</hi> without that they of the Country could joyn together for their defence. Being then fallen back into their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer miſeries under the yoke of Arms, there was no doubt but that the <hi>Griſons</hi> would ſubmit to the Treaty, becauſe that of <hi>Milan</hi> was concluded and confirmed. The ten Directorſhips remained at the diſpoſe of the Archduke, who obliges them not only not to permit other than the exerciſe of the Catholick Faith, but reſerves to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a power to plant Fortreſſes, diſplace Garriſons, and to keep them at preſent in <hi>Majanfelt</hi> and <hi>Coira.</hi> It was to no purpoſe that <hi>Molina</hi> and ſome <hi>Switzer</hi> Cantons made their proteſts againſt it; for the Commons of the <hi>Cadé</hi> and the <hi>Griſa</hi> having a Meeting in <hi>Coira</hi> approved all, renouncing the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> reſerving to themſelves no other hope but to ſupplicate <hi>Feria</hi> for ſome moderate Reformation in that of <hi>Milan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner paſſed this year in the <hi>Griſons,</hi> in the end whereof <hi>France</hi> began to apply more attentively its thoughts to it, being free from domeſtick War, having concluded a Peace with the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots</hi> under the Walls of <hi>Monpellier,</hi> a ſtrong Town of <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock.</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:53750:99"/>
The King in this Siege meeting with greater difficulties than ſuppoſed, and not regarding the endeavours to the contrary, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſuggeſted with many Stratagems of Conſcience and State, and ſlighting the averſion of <hi>Conde</hi> himſelf, who goes from Court and out of the Kingdom, gave his aſſent to it. Many of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions nevertheleſs not being performed, which the <hi>Huguenots</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed were promiſed to them, as to diſmantle the Fort <hi>Louis,</hi> not to put a Garriſon into <hi>Monpellier,</hi> nor place a Citadel there; the opinion was afterwards believed, that <hi>Piſieux</hi> had appeaſed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> by telling him that the <hi>Huguenots</hi> could not more eaſily be ruined than by aſſuring them, diſarming them, and deceiving them. But whatſoever the intention was, ſure it is, that it was judged in <hi>Italy</hi> that affairs were to change their aſpect; for the King being come forward to <hi>Lions,</hi> found there the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> with his eldeſt Son, and having fully underſtood the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> diſcovered their ends, and examined their deſigns extended into ſeveral parts, it was reſolved to oppoſe them, and the Meeting being transferred to <hi>Avignon;</hi> where meeting for the King the Conſtable <hi>Deſdiguieres,</hi> the <hi>Garde-ſeau,</hi> Mareſhal <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and <hi>Piſieux;</hi> for the <hi>Venetians, Giovanni Peſari</hi> their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and the Duke himſelf of <hi>Savoy</hi> in perſon, the means were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed of uniting themſelves, ſo as to imploy their Forces in favour of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and by ſome diverſion trouble the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The concluſion of the Articles was deferred till the next year.</p>
               <p>The King in that interim returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> and <hi>Carlo</hi> into <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi> At the report only of ſuch a Meeting, 'tis not to be believed how much the Miniſters at <hi>Madrid</hi> were moved at it, who reſolving to artifice to joyn threats and fear, declare to the Popes <hi>Nuntio</hi> themſelves no more bound to the depoſition of the Forts, proteſting, <hi>That ſuch a Rupture would ariſe betwixt the Crowns, that neither the Authority of the Pope would be ſufficient to ſet it right again, nor his own life ſo long as to ſee an end of the Slaughters and Calamities which would follow upon it.</hi> In effect, the affairs of <hi>Rhetia</hi> could not be otherwiſe repaired but by puiſſant Forces, becauſe they were forſaken by all, and deſtitute alſo of <hi>Mansfelts</hi> diverſion in <hi>Alſace;</hi> for, as much opportunity, as the jealouſie, riſen betwixt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Bavarians,</hi> which kept thoſe Armies idle at the <hi>Rhine</hi> for a time, had given for his progreſſes; ſo much alſo did their Union, which at laſt followed, contribute to take it away. To ſay truth, the ſucceſſes in thoſe parts were no leſs important than worthy the due obſervation and reflection of all <hi>Europe. Mansfelt</hi> with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Adventurer, as might be ſaid, giving a Leſſon to other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains, who have ſince known largely enough to make uſe of it, how to make it ſubſiſt without Pay and without Country, by Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Pillage out of <hi>Alſace</hi> marches towards the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing that he made War in the name of <hi>Frederick.</hi> He neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs intermitted not Treaties at the ſame time, and at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant had by him Deputies of the <hi>Infanta Iſabella</hi> Governeſs of

                  <hi>Flanders,</hi> and had in a manner concluded with large Conditions to be created a Prince of the Empire, with the perpetual Fief of <hi>Haghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau</hi> for himſelf and his deſcendants, beſides great ſums of money, and ſuch places in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army as to be ſubordinate to <hi>Spinola</hi> only.</p>
               <p>But behold <hi>Frederick</hi> now appears in this Army, having paſſed by reaſon of the length of the way through many dangers; for weary any longer to be amuſed and deluded with dilatory hopes, he parts from <hi>Holland,</hi> and in a diſguiſe with two perſons paſſing by Sea to <hi>France,</hi> from thence croſſes <hi>Lorrain,</hi> through the midſt of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Troops; and at one lodging meeting with ſome Souldiers, and feigning himſelf to be of the ſame profeſſion, the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal himſelf, was conſtrained amidſt the round of the Cups to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate his own perſon. At <hi>Landau,</hi> where <hi>Mansfelt</hi> had a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he diſcovers himſelf; thence at <hi>Germerſheim</hi> finds the Count himſelf incamped, who received him with great applauſe. The Marqueſs <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Dorlach,</hi> came thither to him, who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf for that Party with an Army in great order, and the Count then diſcharging the Deputies of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> they poſſeſs the Biſhoprick of <hi>Spire,</hi> and recover <hi>Manheim,</hi> and other places of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> giving ſome little blow to the Troops of <hi>Tilli,</hi> who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to oppoſe them. <hi>Halverſtadt</hi> alſo advanced after he had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the City of <hi>Paderborn,</hi> where he ſollicited for Divine vengeance, exerciſing againſt the Catholicks all ſeverity with ſavage cruelty, extorting all their ſubſtance, expoſing Churches to plunder, convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ornaments of Divine Worſhip and the Reliques of Saints in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to money to pay the Souldiers. Upon theſe proceedings were the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi> with the Renfort alſo of the Imperial Troops, obliged to joyn againſt the common Enemies, betwixt <hi>Vim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen</hi> and <hi>Hailbrun,</hi> upon the ſide of the <hi>Nec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ar.</hi> On the other ſide by moſt pernicious counſel the Proteſtants ſeparate, while <hi>Dorlach</hi> by private jarrings having made himſelf incompatible with <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> divides from him; but being ſcarce lodged in the Village of <hi>Over-Erſheim,</hi> underſtands, that <hi>Tilli</hi> marched towards him, when putting himſelf in order in the Campagnia, he environs himſelf with Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, forming a large circuit, with his Artillery in fit places marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly well placed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tilli</hi> on the other ſide preſenting battel, had ordered his Army upon a long Line, with bodies of reſerve in the Reer, and with ſome Cannon in the Front; but receiving great hurt from thoſe of the Enemy, his Troops were near taking flight, and abandoning the field, when a Cannon-ſhot falling in the middle of <hi>Dorlachs</hi> Squadrons, where among the Baggage was the Ammunition, with a horrible blow ſets the powder on fire. The fire ſpread it ſelf into all parts; and Carts, living Creatures, and Souldiers flying in a moment into the Air, fell down in aſhes, with leſs unhappineſs than they who half burnt lay in a pitiful manner roaring and bewailing themſelves. It ſeemed ſurely a blow from Heaven, which in an inſtant deſtroyed whole Squadrons, and thoſe that being further off remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53750:100"/>
uncertain whether that terrible ſound was a Thunder-bolt, or at leaſt a Mine, being frighted ran preſently away, leaving that unhappy field covered with aſhes and bones. The Catholicks, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by ſo happy an accident, overcoming without fighting, failed not in the flight to purſue them, with no leſs ſlaughter than that which the fire had cauſed. The Marqueſs with a few more hardly ſaved his life, but not his Country; for that coming to be conteſted by his Nephews, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> adjudges it to them, and the Archduke puts into poſſeſſion <hi>William</hi> the Elder, who, having been brought up in the Court of <hi>Flanders</hi> in the Catholick Religion, baniſhed imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately every other Belief. Upon the advice of ſo great a blow <hi>Halverſtadt</hi> makes haſte, and with twelve thouſand Foot, and more than eighty Companies of Horſe arrives at <hi>Hochſt,</hi> a ſmall place a little below <hi>Francfort,</hi> upon the ſide of the <hi>Main</hi> with deſign, having paſſed the River, with ſpeedy marches and avoiding fighting to joyn with <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> and give new vigour to that Party. But ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more time than he believed in the building of a Bridge, he ſaw himſelf overtaken by <hi>Tilli,</hi> who, joyned to <hi>Cordua,</hi> was thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtronger in number, &amp; purſued him to conſtrain him to a battel. He, ſending the Baggage with almoſt all the Cannon to the other ſide of the River, hoped to amuſe the Enemy with Skirmiſhes, and to delude him at laſt, by bringing himſelf and the nimbleſt of his Troops into ſafety; but the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> having ſeized the paſſages, preſſed him in ſuch ſort, that he could not avoid the ſhock.</p>
               <p>They fought then under the Walls of <hi>Hochſt</hi> for ſome hours, <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſtadts</hi> people at firſt making great reſiſtance, though from twenty four Cannons, fitly placed by the Catholicks, they received great loſs. At laſt, all order being confounded, the Cavalry were the firſt that ſhewed their backs, running to the Bridge, where all being in confuſion amidſt the noiſe, flight and throng, they preſſed in ſuch ſort, that the Bridge yielding under the burden brake, and many falling into the River, what with their Baggage, and what with their Arms, were drowned. All order and direction now wanting, it was no more a battel but ſlaughter. Men fell in heaps, and ſo their Horſes, and every one ſeeking a way to eſcape without finding it, no man reſiſted longer, or delayed common danger, Fortune ſhewing the way of ſafety to very few. <hi>Halverſtadt</hi> himſelf takes the River, and little was wanting but that the Incendiary of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> had been quenched. After ſuch a defeat, being got to the other ſide of the <hi>Main,</hi> he endeavours to rally what he could of the Cavalry; for the Foot were almoſt all cut to pieces, and ſo he joyns <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> who, not at all diſheartned by ſuch blows to the common Party, carries him to the relief of <hi>Haguenau,</hi> beſieged by <hi>Leopold,</hi> and where he had left his ſpoils and booty, and placed the very hopes of a moſt aſſured refuge. Nor did the attempt ſucceed ill; for the Archduke by the ſuppoſed diſtance and weakneſs of his Enemies, lodging with more ſecurity of mind than defence, advice, unlooked for, being brought to him that they were come near, ſends a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe to diſcover, which being met by <hi>Obentraut,</hi> and beaten,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53750:101"/>
brought back ſuch fright and terror into the Camp, that it was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as in a tumult with diſorder and loſs. The place ſaved, it was yet expedient for <hi>Mansfelt</hi> to try another Exploit for enlarging his Quarters and Proviſion of Victuals, that Country being already eaten up; whereupon he makes choice of <hi>Zaverne</hi> as fitter for his purpoſe than any other. The <hi>Palatine</hi> was all this while in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, ſerving only for a ſhew and a name: But King <hi>James,</hi> inveigled by wonted Arts, perſwades him to withdraw himſelf; for that the meeting, to find a compoſure of his affairs, being brought back to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> ſeemed not to know how to be aſſured of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> ſo long as they ſaw him in the hands of <hi>Mansfelt</hi> and <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſtadt,</hi> their ſo bitter Enemies. And he alſo adheres ſo much the more willingly to that counſel, by how much he ſaw <hi>Dorlach</hi> waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to nothing, <hi>Halverſtadt</hi> weakned, and <hi>Mansfelt</hi> (wont, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of Arms wavered, to apply himſelf to Treaties) was always ſuſpected by him, leſt one day he ſhould ſell him, and ſacrifice him to his own intereſt. But he was no ſooner returned into <hi>Holland,</hi> and by a publick Declaration, (to ſhew his ſincerity ſo much the more to the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi>) diſcharged out of his ſervice <hi>Mansfelt</hi> and his Followers; but he perceived, that from an Enemy offended and in Arms, he that had no Forces could expect but hard Conditions of Peace; for there was offered to him but a ſmall pitance of his Country with the reſt to his eldeſt Son after the death of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> on condition that he ſhould paſs from Calviniſm to the Catholick Faith. But ſuch offers being openly rejected by <hi>Frederick</hi> and the Miniſters of the King of <hi>England,</hi> the buſineſs was again referred to a Diet in <hi>Ratisbone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By ſuch Negotiations Peace being retarded, the War was more vigorouſly proſecuted. <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> the ancient Seat of the <hi>Palatines,</hi> was by <hi>Tilli</hi> taken by force, and <hi>Franckental</hi> reduced by <hi>Cordua</hi> to extremity; ſo that the King of <hi>England,</hi> who publiſhed that he held that Country under his Protection, deſiring by ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
though laught at by the World, to cover the contempt, not being able to ſuccour it, conſents to a Truce of fifteen months; during which, <hi>Franckental,</hi> and the reſt of the lower <hi>Palatinate</hi> ſhould be depoſited in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands to reſtore them to the King, if within that time there were not a Peace concluded. So the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in that ſtate of things, contenting themſelves only with a promiſe, abandoned, ſoon after, the hopes alſo of recovering that place, the which for many years went not out of the hand of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> till the new changes of Fortune, and the times obliged them to render it. But <hi>Mansfelt</hi> was conſtrained to raiſe the Siege from before <hi>Zaverna,</hi> both becauſe the Catholick Armies, being at liberty from the imployment of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> threatned to draw towards him, and that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> not being willing to ſuffer him to neſtle himſelf upon his Borders, was preparing to relieve it. He nevertheleſs at that very time, when his Martial attempts ſucceeded not, ſets on foot a Treaty with <hi>Tilli</hi> in his own and <hi>Helverſtadts</hi> name with offers to change his Party; but his artifices, now ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53750:101"/>
times diſcovered, were by the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> with equal arts deluded. He nevertheleſs with a flouriſhing Army, and cryed up by Military men, kept himſelf in great reputation of equally valiant and wiſe, ſo that to ſtrifs he was earneſtly preſſed with offers from all parts. He inclined not, though he were invited to it by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the affairs of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> to paſs into <hi>Rhetia,</hi> apprehending that, amidſt the difficulty of the Paſſes and the Straights of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, he might conſume that Army which was accuſtomed with great ſpoils to maintain it ſelf in the ſpatious Provinces of <hi>Germany;</hi> but he equally hearkened to the inſtances of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who with cryes and provocations of Religion called him to their ſuccours, and to thoſe of the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> who with equal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of their Religion, with greater recompence, ſued to him for aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>At laſt not being able to ſubſiſt longer in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> whilſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Tilli, Cordua,</hi> and <hi>Leopold</hi> flanked upon him, and reflecting, that with the <hi>Huguenots</hi> it was rather to maintain a broken Faction than a ſetled Principality, he reſolves to go into <hi>Holland.</hi> It was therefore neceſſary to keep his intention ſecret, and deceive with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny various reports and divers marches, as he did: For having with great artifice diſarmed the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who expected nothing like it, of a ſudden he marches into the middle of his Country, and in revenge that he had diſturbed him in the Enterpriſe of <hi>Zaverne,</hi> put it into ſo great confuſion and fright with ſuch bitter loſſes, that the Duke was conſtrained to give him paſſage, furniſh him with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and perſwade him to vent that Military ſtorm elſewhere. Nor did the Count fail; for the licence of his Souldiery being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated in <hi>Lorrain,</hi> he enters into the Biſhopricks of <hi>Verdun</hi> and <hi>Metz</hi> with ſuch terrour to the neighbouring Countries, that <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf was in a fright, whilſt the King, by reaſon of the War with the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots,</hi> was ſo far off. The Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> Governour of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,</hi> by all ſorts of fair means and promiſes endeavours to ſtop him; and he, to lay truth, baring thoſe licences, which to an Army that had no other livelyhood but rapine he was neceſſitated to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, he reſtrained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>y as much as he could. Fear therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Province of <hi>Flanders,</hi> towards whom it now appeared the march was directed, and the <hi>Infanta</hi> with no leſs ſolicitude en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to keep him afar off, ſending as far as to the <hi>Pont a Mouſon</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bornoville,</hi> who with large offers was to perſwade him to divert ſome whither elſe, or to inroul himſelf under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours. Certainly it was wonderful to conſider, that an Army, new raiſed and mercenary, without the Authority of Princes, and without the Protection of Dominion, driven out of <hi>Germany</hi> after having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run it, and in a great meaſure laid it waſte, ſhould now be the Scourge of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Fear of <hi>France,</hi> the Terror of <hi>Flanders,</hi> be paid by many, intreated by all, and every where moſt earneſtly deſired.</p>
               <p>But whilſt this fury of War in ſo many places either laid waſte or threatned, diſcord ſlides into its bowels, <hi>Halverſtadt</hi> upon great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents ſeparating, who being ſollicited by the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:53750:102"/>
inclined to aſſiſt the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> Little wanted but that the common Souldiers, according to the animoſity of the Chiefs, at variance alſo amongſt themſelves, had not fallen to kill one another, and with inteſtine Arms expiated the offence and the exceſſes till now committed. But at laſt foreſeeing in their diſunion their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſidering that the flatteries and propoſitions of <hi>Nevers,</hi> by gaining time, had ſerved ſo to arm the Frontier, as to be able to make a ſtrong reſiſtance; the Commanders and the Troops recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled amongſt themſelves, and leaving as in truſt, under the faith of the Governour of the place, the Cannon in the Suburbs of <hi>Mouſon,</hi> burning many Carriages, to ſet a greater number of men on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, he continues his march with haſte. And it was now neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for him to haſten it, becauſe <hi>Cordua,</hi> ſollicited not only by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta,</hi> but alſo by the <hi>French,</hi> was come to <hi>Ivoy</hi> in <hi>Lutzemburg</hi> to croſs him in his way, but with a ſtrength inferiour, not exceeding ten thouſand Foot and five thouſand Horſe; ſo that at the firſt Encounter of <hi>Mansfelts</hi> Horſe, who confidently ravaged the Country, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a little blow. But a while after, re-inforced by the Colonel <hi>Verdugo,</hi> whom <hi>Spinola,</hi> without abandoning the Siege of <hi>Bergop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoom</hi> ſent to his relief (the Armies now being near an equal ſtrength) they ſtraitned one anothers victuals and march in ſuch ſort, that they could not now ſay nay to the battel. So that at <hi>Fleury</hi> in the Province of <hi>Henault</hi> they preſentred themſelves to it.</p>

                  <hi>Mansfelt</hi> calling the Chiefs and principal Commanders of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to him, to incourage them ſays. <hi>If out of our Country and from quiet, Glory and Reward have brought us hither through ſo many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, amidſt infinite dangers, the occaſion preſents here in this field an abundant harveſt.

pretend not for my ſelf but reputation and well deſerving; for I aſpire to nothing but that death it ſelf which into its boſom gathers the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion of all, ſhould leave me upon my Sepulchre a Record of Glory. I ſhould do wrong to your Courage, if over and above vaſt recompences, I ſhould particularize to you the neceſſity of fighting. You perceive very well that we are environed on all ſides in the heart of the Enemies Country. Whether can we have a ſecure retreat, or where a ſafe refuge? without Country, without money, in this Army alone and the ſtrength of your Arms we have Kingdoms and Treaſures. As we are now armed, we are the Scourge of Princes, and the Terror of</hi> Europe; <hi>if overcome, we ſhall be named with infamy, proſcribed by the</hi> Auſtrians, <hi>and curſed by all. In ſum, there being no Sanctuary betwixt Victory and Death, we muſt either be beaten, or get the Victory.</hi>

               <p>While he was thus ſpeaking, <hi>Cordua</hi> on the other part failed not, riding round his Army, to put ſome in mind of the Honour of the Nation, others of the defence of their own Country, and all of the duty to Religion, and the Kings Service. But now the Cannon henceforward ſilenced words. <hi>Cordua</hi> had diſpoſed ſeven in three places. <hi>Mansfelt</hi> had but two, and therefore it behoved him with a ſpeedy march to haſten to the ſhock; but at the ſame inſtant he commanded them to move, he found that in mercenary Armies and compoſed of Voluntiers, many pretended to be equal, if not ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, to their Chief. All had not the ſame motives to fight, nor the ſame intereſt to overcome. Part therefore of the Horſe muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtood ſtill inſtead of going to the Charge, demanding Pay. The Counts intreaties or reaſons, nor that calling ſome by their names he put others in mind of their notable actions, and ſhewed to all, that in the neceſſity of fighting were placed vaſt rewards, and in Victory their pay and reſt, prevailed not, but that they ſtood immoveable Spectators of the Battel. Nor could he now refuſe it, but with an Army weakned in number and ſpirit, he reſolved to enter into it with ſo great valour and ſuch prudence, that greater courage or better conduct could not be deſired from himſelf. In the left Wing <hi>Halverſtadt</hi> maintained the fight with his Horſe ſo long till his Arm being broken with a Bullet, which was afterwards cut off, he was obliged to yield to the pain and the Enemy. In the right one the Dukes of <hi>Weimar</hi> and the Count of <hi>Ortemberg</hi> were killed. The Cavalry then which remained faithful, wanting their Chiefs, quit the field, leaving the Foot, which for the moſt part was cut to pieces on the place. And <hi>Cordua,</hi> although he had the Cannon and Baggage of the Count, with the name of a Victory, received a great blow, nor could he ſo ſuddenly repair himſelf as to follow him; whereupon <hi>Mansfelt</hi> gathering up the remainder, which were not a few, and the Mutineers joyning again with him, who at laſt ſaw themſelves in the ſame danger, marches through <hi>Brabant</hi> with ſeven thouſand Horſe. Count <hi>Henry Vanden Bergh,</hi> who was to have ſtopped his paſſage, returning too late from <hi>Frizland,</hi> where he amuſed the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with a diverſion; by this means the Count had free liberty to joyn himſelf with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

the relief of <hi>Berghopzoom. Spinola,</hi> ever ſince the month of <hi>July,</hi> had beſieged the place, and by reaſon of the importance of it, Forces not unequal were imployed both in the Siege and in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. It is ſituate on the right ſide of a Chanel of the <hi>Scheld,</hi> where beneath <hi>Antwerp</hi> it divides it ſelf into ſeveral branches, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, or rather confounds the Confines of <hi>Holland, Zeland,</hi> and <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.</hi> Nature there ſcarce leaves the Land to be diſtinguiſhed from the Sea: At one time it is covered with the Sea, and at another it remains dry. Heaps of Sand diſcover themſelves in ſome places, and Gulphs of hidden Moors deepen in others; and the Chanels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many, and the Sea-walls every where continued, it looks as if the Waters travelled by Land, and the Fields ſailed by Sea. The <hi>Zoom,</hi> a ſmall River, made famous from the place, riſes and runs on that ſide, and being received in an artificial Chanel in a ſtraight and ſhort courſe, is carried into the <hi>Scheld.</hi> The place is of an irregular form and unſafe; of it ſelf little, but enlarged with many Out-works, and that with ſo many advantages of ſituation, and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtries of invention, that perhaps for the well fortifying of another place, Nature and Art have not made a ſtrength greater. Not far diſtant Forts, like ſo many Iſlands, do in all places appear, either where the Chanels run, or where the Country is overflowed, or the paſſage is open for Supplies and the Commerce with neighbour places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spinola</hi> in this one place had many to conquer; and therefore the Circumvallation was ordered with great Art. The chief Quarters were diſtributed where there was a height betwixt low and mariſh places, the reſt was environed with a continual Trench fortified with Forts and Redoubts. The approaches were carried on where the ſoil permitted, and the ſtanding waters in ſome places ſerved equally as a defence of the ſecurity of the Camp. About certain Half-moons and other Out-works, there were inceſſant fightings and aſſaults, often taken and re-taken with great ſlaughter. All in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions might be ſaid to conſpire againſt the life of man: Cannon was not ſufficient, but Treacheries were hidden under ground with Mines and Fire. Some were met with by the beſieged, others had no effect, many carried men and earth into the air, and ſo reſolute was the defence and the attacque, that the Garriſon, being ſtrong and numerous, defended the Poſts, recovered them when loſt, formed new ones, and aſſaulted thoſe of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with ſo much force and boldneſs, that it could not ſometimes be diſtinguiſhed who was the aggreſſor and who the aggreſſed. <hi>Spinola</hi> could not totally ſhut up the way of relief, becauſe the Sea, Rivers, and Chanels kept it open, and they were kept by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> by a multitude of Forts; and ſometimes they laid the Country under water, and then let it run off again in ſuch ſort, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> frequently ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack in their Poſts, ſometimes they were ſeen beſieged by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation, and at others, buried in the mud. Nevertheleſs endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all inconveniencies with great reſolution, and overcoming dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with force, <hi>Spinola</hi> would at laſt, if a general ſuccour had not
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53750:103"/>
arrived, taken the place; but by the coming of <hi>Mansfelt, Orange,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in ſtrength, reputation, and courage, encamps at <hi>Gertrudem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> and making a ſhew to attempt its Relief by Land, ſent it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily by Sea with ſo great a number of men, that the Garriſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to ten thouſand Souldiers, he threatned by a double aſſault to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by force out of their Camp. <hi>Spinola</hi> finding himſelf with an Army in a great meaſure ſick, the reſt wearied out, and ſome ſo much ſuſpected by him, that he feared a Mutiny in his Quarters, and intelligence with the Enemy, thought beſt to retire.</p>
               <p>In this interim, <hi>Mansfelt</hi> being abſent, all the lower <hi>Palatinate</hi> was forced to ſubmit, and the Town of <hi>Haghenau,</hi> with the Cities of <hi>Spire, Germerſheim,</hi> and other places, eaſily yielded to <hi>Leopold,</hi> Amidſt ſuch multitudes of men ſlain, it ſerved for a kind of breathing and ſecurity to Chriſtendom, that the Enemies of it, with equal fury and examples not uſual, were buſied amongſt themſelves. The <hi>Turks</hi> have nothing of moderation; either they adore their Princes as Gods, or kill them like Tyrants. <hi>Oſman,</hi> a very young man, was Emperour of that vaſt State, who by unhappy ſucceſs in the War of <hi>Poland,</hi> fruſtrate of that Glory, which he had fancied to himſelf, was much unſatisfied with the <hi>Janiſſaries,</hi> to whom alone he impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fault of his ill Fortune, for having ſhewed themſelves as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in the field as fierce and inſolent in the Court. After a Peace concluded upon Terms little honourable, he publiſhed that he would make a Voyage to <hi>Mecha,,</hi> under a ſhew of zeal to Religion, but believed by many mingled with a youthful wearineſs of remaining ſo very long and idle at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Others judged, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed a deeper deſign to remove the <hi>Janiſſaries</hi> from the Court, bring them into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and there amidſt a greater force of the <hi>Spahies</hi> their Envyers, diſarm and diſband them, and form a new Militia. The Baggage was ſhipping in the Gallies; Tents and ſtore of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure were carried along to ſerve in the Voyage, and honour the Sepulchre of that Impoſtor with vaſt Preſents, when the <hi>Janiſſaries</hi> one to another began to diſcourſe of the fatigue and hardſhips to which, in ſo long a Pilgrimage, they were going to be expoſed, and of the conveniences they left behind, the further they went, and the more divided they were, the more expoſed to the hatred and cruelty of the King, more apprehended than any other hazard. Upon this from whiſpering in their Quarters, they fell quickly into a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult; and a few beginning, but all following, they came into the place of the <hi>Hippodromo</hi> to the number of thirty thouſand perſons; from thence one part runs to the Houſe of the <hi>Coza</hi> (who was the Kings School-maſter, and thought to be the Promoter of the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,) but finding him not, expoſed it to pillage; the reſt haſtned to the <hi>Seraglio</hi> with loud cryes, requiring the heads of the <hi>Viſir,</hi> of the <hi>Cheſlar,</hi> and of the <hi>Coza.</hi> They within wanted force, and had they had it, counſel. The principal perſons, who with authority and friendlineſs might have oppoſed the inraged multitude, were the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry object of their hatred, and were demanded that they might tear them to pieces.

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Janiſſaries</hi> then caſting off all reſpect towards their Prince, flinging ſtones at their <hi>Aga,</hi> who put them in mind of their Oath and Fidelity, denying <hi>Cuſſain Baſſa,</hi> who to quiet them, offered three hundred thouſand <hi>Zerchins,</hi> forcing the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> though during that night, extraordinarily guarded, kill at the firſt entry certain Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs with <hi>Chiſlar Aga</hi> their Chief, and ſought after <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Oſman,</hi> who formerly had ſerved a ſhort ſpace rather for a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery than the Head of that Empire: he that would not, or could not ſhew where he was, they preſently as in puniſhment of ſilence or ignorance cut off their heads. Getting down at laſt by ſigns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to a Cellar under ground, they found him by order of his Nephew there, in a manner buried and little leſs than dead; for they had kept him two days already without meat; ſo that to the cryes of making him Emperour, he anſwered, deſiring at leaſt a few drops of water as the price of the Empire. But he was ſcarce ſetled in the Throne but he ſhewed himſelf equally thirſty of <hi>Oſmans</hi> blood. He had baſely hid himſelf; but being found when it was very late, and committed to the cuſtody of the <hi>Buſtangi Baſſa,</hi> he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conducted to the houſe of the <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janiſſaries,</hi> where <hi>Cuſſain Baſſa</hi> only was. In many anger yielded to compaſſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that young Prince, King by birth, made Suppliant to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and he improving that compaſſion with his intereſt, offered to the <hi>Janiſſaries</hi> fifty <hi>Zecchins</hi> a head. Some now relented, and the Chiefs conſulted about the means to preſerve him and re-eſtabliſh him in the Throne, when the furious multitude taking him out of their hands, preſented him to <hi>Muſtapha</hi> in the <hi>Seraglio. Oſman</hi> with tears begs his life of his Uncle, putting him in mind of gratitude for having, contrary to the cuſtom of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours, perſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him for the Empire. But the <hi>Barbarians</hi> making Deſtiny guilty and Author of their villanies, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> excuſes himſelf, ſaying, that he knew he had oftentimes decreed his death, but that God would not permit it. Left then in prey to the <hi>Janiſſaries,</hi> and conducted to the ſeven Towers, amidſt the concourſe and execrations of the people, who having, during his Reign, endured all kinds of calamity, Hunger, Peſtilence, and War, deteſted him as the fatal occaſion of their evils, his Head was cut off. <hi>Delivert</hi> grand <hi>Viſir,</hi> in this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim fled; but taken at <hi>Scutari,</hi> and brought back to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he was killed, with his blood and a few others of the chief Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and the pillaging of ſome houſe, the Tumult ceaſing.

                  <hi>Bohemia</hi> being not alone, but the Imperial Crown, the object and reward of the War which inflamed <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced ſo much the more in the Victories they had gotten, by how much with the ſpoils of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> having taken away a Vote from the Proteſtant, the Empire ſeemed to be confirmed in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and the Catholick Party. The <hi>Pope</hi> with motives of Religion preſſed, that the <hi>Electorate</hi> might be diſpoſed of, and recommended <hi>Bavaria,</hi> not only a Kinſman in blood to the proſcribed <hi>Palatine,</hi> but worthily deſerving it for his piety; promiſing alſo great aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if it ſhould be neceſſary to maintain the diſpoſal and decree by Arms. Nor was <hi>Ferdinand</hi> againſt it, but rather found himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in his word and intereſt for <hi>Maximilian;</hi> and he by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entire poſſeſſion of both the <hi>Palatinates,</hi> by his own Forces and thoſe of the Catholick Ligue, made himſelf ſo much conſidered and almoſt feared, that it was not eaſie to diſpoſe of it to another. The Emperour was very earneſt to get out of his hands by this change the Upper <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which <hi>Bavaria</hi> held engaged for thirteen milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Florins, which in ſubduing the Rebels he affirmed to have ſpent; but great difficulties croſſed his deſires.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were inraged, and in particular <hi>Saxony,</hi> vexed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides at the Reformation of Religion, which was practiſed in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia;</hi> many had compaſſion of the calamities of the <hi>Palatine</hi> and the innocence of his Children, and not a few pretended to be ſharers in his ruine. But the moſt conſiderable oppoſition roſe from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> who irritated, that <hi>Bavaria</hi> had by Arms poſſeſſed himſelf of a part of the <hi>Lower Palatinate,</hi> openly oppoſed <hi>Ferdinands</hi> intentions, and that with a pretext, that it was not fit ſo publickly to offend the King of <hi>England;</hi> and with reaſons beſides, that it was not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to ſet him up ſo high, who might one day diſpute the Empire with the <hi>Auſtrians;</hi> but that reſolving to maintain the Inveſtiture by Arms, it was better to come to extremities, and beſtowing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome of their own Kindred, to advance the greatneſs of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily with an Electoral Vote. But the Emperour aiming to recover his own, and to amuſe thoſe of both Religions in the Empire, ſends to <hi>Saxe</hi> the Archduke <hi>Carlo,</hi> his Brother, to perſwade and appeaſe him, and into <hi>Spain,</hi> ſome Religious perſons to repreſent motives by which he was induced and in a manner forced to reſolve.</p>
               <p>There happened at this time the ſudden Voyage of <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>England</hi> to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> which put into admiration all
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53750:105"/>
                  <hi>Europe,</hi> doubtful which was greateſt, the artifice on the one ſide in ſolliciting it, or the happineſs on the other in performing it. In <hi>Madrid, Digby</hi> reſided Ambaſſadour for King <hi>James,</hi> ſo much ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured with ſuch a Negotiation, that propoſing to himſelf great rewards, according to his deſires and proper intereſt, he continually repreſented facility and ſafety. The project conſiſted on the one ſide of promiſes to reſtore the <hi>Palatine</hi> into his Country and Vote, and on the other, of a connivence, or rather aſſiſtance to oppreſs the United Provinces of <hi>Holland.</hi> There reſided then in <hi>London</hi> for the Catholick King the Count of <hi>Gondomar,</hi> who with a ſtupendious acuteneſs of wit ſo confounded pleaſant things with ſerious, that it was not eaſie to be diſcerned when he ſpoke of buſineſs, and when he rallied. He had marvellouſly poſſeſſed the mind of the King, and the inclination of the Prince, and ſo inſinuating himſelf into the hopes and inclination of both with myſterious ſpeeches and faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcourſes, he perſwades him in earneſt to reſolve, that <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf <hi>incognito</hi> ſhould ſurpriſe them at <hi>Madrid</hi> to conclude the Marriage, and bring back the Bride to <hi>London.</hi> The Prince then parting in great ſilence, paſſes diſguiſed by Poſt through <hi>France,</hi> accompanied by few others, but the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Director of the whole Affair, and who with an unuſual example enjoyed no leſs favour from the King in being than from the Prince his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. Not many reſolutions haply are to be found which made a noiſe equal to this. Of a Prince that was foreſeeing to a wonder, who was over-ſhadowed with jealouſie; the people made it their diſcourſe, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> more than any murmured at it; the only Son of the King, the Heir of the Kingdom, hazard himſelf in ſuch a long Voyage, carry himſelf as an Hoſtage, rather than a Spouſe; to a Court of contrary Maxims of Religion and State humbly to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate for a Wife. Moſt men would not be perſwaded but the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was concluded; ſo that many diſcourſes were made of ſecret Alliances, and the Proteſtants feared it, nay ſome of the Catholicks themſelves no leſs ſuſpiciouſly apprehended it, <hi>Bavaria</hi> in particular doubting leſt the Country and Dignity, in favour of the Marriage, ſhould be reſtored to <hi>Frederick;</hi> and <hi>France</hi> was jealous, leſt if <hi>Great Brittany</hi> ſhould adhere to the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> their Power in <hi>Europe</hi> would be without a ballance. In <hi>England</hi> the Hereticks were afraid, leſt the King, inclined to change Religion, to effect it with greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity had a mind to ſupport himſelf by the Forces and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of great Princes, and the Catholicks rejoyced, hoping by ſuch a Marriage for Liberty of Conſcience and ſecurity for their lives. In <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> where the Diet was aſſembled, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour pretended, that without diſpoſing of the <hi>Electorate,</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour ſhould at leaſt ſtay to ſee the iſſue of this Voyage, and of ſo great an Emergency.</p>
               <p>But thoſe of the Popes party and the <hi>Bavarians</hi> with unuſual and inceſſant inſtances preſſed him to declare himſelf, and end the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Notwithſtanding then that the major part of the Empire were of opinion, that the Authority did not belong to the Emperour alone
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53750:105"/>
in a matter of ſo great importance to deprive an Elector, and at his own pleaſure to make choice of another, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> calling the Clergy apart and ſome others of the principal Miniſters, declared to them his reſolution, not aſking counſel; but ſhewing, <hi>That ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Dignity, which participated in the conſervation of the Empire, could not be ſo vacant. That</hi> Frederick <hi>by Rebellion and ſo many other offences had made himſelf unworthy of it. That</hi> Bavaria, <hi>who was of the ſame Houſe</hi> Palatine, <hi>for his piety and ſervices done to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire did as much deſerve it. That the reaſons of the Pretenders, among which was the Duke of</hi> Neoburg <hi>of the ſame ſtock, could not at preſent, they being far off, be diſcuſſed; and therefore he referred them to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diet. That in the mean time, by the Authority exerciſed by his Predeceſſors in like caſes, he did inveſt</hi> Maximilian <hi>with the Electoral Dignity.</hi> Some applauded and approved; others ſilently adhered by force, the Proteſtants in vain pondering to reſent it; in regard the power of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the felicity of the Catholick Arms curbed the wills of the factious, and no leſs abated the thoughts of the diſobedient. <hi>Bavaria</hi> had no ſooner obtained his purpoſe, but begins to conſider of the means to preſerve the Dignity, as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from thoſe Arts by which he had gotten it; and being always mindful of the jealouſie and oppoſition of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſeeks new ſtrengthnings againſt their envy and force. He ſent into <hi>France</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſecret Meſſengers to ſupport himſelf by that Crown, and to ſhew himſelf partial to their advantages and intereſts; becauſe he believed, that to a Party emulating the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> it would be a Complement; that he ſhould remain in poſſeſſion of the places taken upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from inwarding themſelves further into the Empire. Whereupon, not ſeparating himſelf in the union of Forces from <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> he was at work with new Treaties, and forming ſtronger friendſhips. It was juſt about this time, not without the <hi>Austrians</hi> jealouſie, diſcovered, that he had ſent to <hi>London</hi> certain Religious perſons, of which ſort he willingly made uſe for leſs obſervation and charge, in diſguiſed habits, with many Propoſitions to King <hi>James,</hi> that he would unite himſelf to that Party of the Catholicks in <hi>Germany,</hi> of which <hi>Maximilian</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was Head, to the end certainly to oppoſe himſelf againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and authority of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But thoſe practices had no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, becauſe in the concluſion of them <hi>Maximilian</hi> gave it to be underſtood, that he would not part with the <hi>Electorate;</hi> but being without Children, and almoſt out of hope to have any, he offered the poſſeſſion of it after his death to the eldeſt of thoſe of the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> provided he were brought up in his Court, and in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, with a promiſe to obtain for him one of the Emperours Daughters to Wife. All theſe Propoſitions were by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Frederick</hi> rejected; becauſe, beſides the change of Religion, they contained but uncertain and remote hopes.</p>
               <p>From theſe foreign occurrences, reflections fell back again to the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> where was contending on all ſides with tricks of wit to arrive at their pretended advantages. The League projected in

                  <hi>France</hi> at the latter end of the year paſt, was in the beginning of this preſent concluded without much difficulty, the intereſt of the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors concurring, it may be ſaid, of themſelves, becauſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> thought not themſeleves ſtrong enough to reſtore the Affairs of the <hi>Griſons</hi> without help of the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> knew an Union neceſſary with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who alone by their nearneſs could furniſh to any undertaking Victuals, other Neceſſaries, and Cannon. The Duke <hi>Carlo</hi> was then deſired to be of the Party, both for his courage and reputation, and by reaſon of the ſituation of his Countries; beſides the advantage of keeping him out of the other Party, well knowing that he would not have been able idlely to look upon a War ſo near him without adhering to one ſide, and making his profit by it. It was then agreed, <hi>That the League ſhould laſt two years, and what more need ſhould require for procuring a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of places taken in the</hi> Valteline <hi>and</hi> Griſons; propoſing to themſelves, <hi>to form the body of an Army of between thirty and forty thouſand Foot, and ſix thouſand Horſe, and they divided by an even proportion; a third to every one of the Princes united, but of thoſe, aſſigning betwixt fifteen and eighteen thouſand of them to</hi> France; <hi>ten or twelve thouſand to the Republick; and eight thouſand to</hi> Savoy, <hi>each to raiſe them as ſoon as might be, and ſend them to their own Frontiers. The Cannon were to be furniſhed by thoſe that were neareſt at a common charge, according to the rating of the Forces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was further concerted, <hi>To procure</hi> Mansfelt <hi>to make a diverſion of the</hi> Auſtrians, <hi>giving him three hundred thouſand Crowns yearly, the half to be paid by</hi> France, <hi>two thirds of the reſt by the Republick, and what remained by</hi> Savoy. <hi>In caſe of Invaſion, the others were to ſend half their men to the aſſiſſtance of the aſſailed, to which the Treaty obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; and if the Confederates ſhould only ſhew a willingneſs to Peace, and remain only defenſive, they referred to another Treaty the conſideration of dividing the Conqueſts, when, forced to Hoſtility, they ſhould happen to make any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Switzers</hi> were invited to enter into this League; but the Catholicks, prepoſſeſſed in a particular Diet, by the endeavours of the <hi>Nuntio</hi> and Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> raiſed ſo many difficulties in the general one of all the body of the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> that, although ſome underſtood that their intereſt was highly concerned in it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs in their accuſtomed delays they let the Propoſition fall. The Treaty was no ſooner concluded, but Duke <hi>Carlo,</hi> well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the liberality of the Republick, earneſtly ſolicited them by the Marqueſs of <hi>Lantz,</hi> ſent to them Ambaſſadour Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, to ſupply him with the means to raiſe and maintain the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which the League laid upon them. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the burden was divided by an equal ballance, according to each ones ability, and that, by reaſon of their nearneſs to the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> they were to bear the hazard and greateſt burden of the War, and beſides, by reaſon of the long Frontier with the <hi>Austrians,</hi> were obliged to a more careful defence, did not hearken to the inſtances
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53750:106"/>
of the Duke, who ſeemed more concerned in Conqueſts and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages than in dangers.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> from <hi>France</hi> was ſent into <hi>Holland</hi> (where the Count then was) <hi>Monſieur de Monteró,</hi> and from the Duke <hi>Monſieur di Bos, Chriſtopher Suriano</hi> ſupplying for the Republick, who reſided with the States, inviting him to make War in the <hi>French</hi> Country, ſuppoſed the fitteſt place to cut off communication of ſuccours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and alſo to be near <hi>Rhetia,</hi> as an Army of reſerve, if any ill accident ſhould happen. And for this purpoſe they advance ſome months pay to him. The Count, who by ſuch art ſubſiſted in credit, ſhewing a readineſs to march, not without the <hi>Spaniards</hi> apprehending, that to this League might adhere other Princes, made jealous or provoked by them, and particularly the <hi>Italians,</hi> the moſt diſguſted, although the moſt patient. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore apply with greater earneſt to protect their intereſt with the Banner of Religion, imploying all art chiefly to gain the <hi>Pope,</hi> under whoſe Skirt they did not only hope to preſerve the <hi>Valteline</hi> from War, and induce the Confederates to reaſon, but ſetling themſelves in the preſent advantages, by this means obtain yet greater.</p>
               <p>To intereſt then <hi>Gregory</hi> in this cauſe, they offer to depoſite the Forts of the <hi>Valteline</hi> in his hands, magnifying their intentions to quiet, and conſidering, <hi>That poſtpoſing their own conveniencies and the poſſeſſion, ſo much the more juſt, by how much it proceeded from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation and a voluntary reſignation of the people, it appeared, that not the deſire of dominion, not the ambition of the Country, nor the deſigns to oppreſs</hi> Italy, <hi>but the ſole conſideration of Religion had induced them to protect it. That they reſigned it to the common Father of Princes, to the Guardian of Religion it ſelf, to the end, that the jealouſies of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks being quieted, the fierceneſs of the Hereticks reſtrained, he might preſcribe rules to holy Worſhip, and to</hi> Italy <hi>convenient ſecurity, whilſt the King would not depend but upon his Arbitrement, and with wonted zeal to his judgment, and the good of the Church, imploy the power of all his Dominions, where no other but the true Religion raigned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> the opinions and counſels upon an offer of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance were wavering; for ſome, penetrating into the Myſteries of Policy, did not approve, that either the power of the Church, or the Authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould be ſo far ingaged, that the profeſſed Neutrality and Mediation ſhould run a hazard. They well knew, that if the truſt were accepted, Peace was not to be hoped for; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if betwixt the Crowns there ſhould happen any agreement of reſtoring all things to their former eſtate, no man could ſee with what decency the <hi>Valteline</hi> could paſs through the hand of the Pope back to the Hereticks, its firſt Maſters; it being not fit that he ſhould ſubſcribe with the Proteſtants to reciprocal limitations, cautions, and conditions. On the other ſide, if with the faſt band of Religion, he ſhould be willing to continue in the poſſeſſion, how could he ever hope for the conſent of the Confederates, who pretended to right themſelves by Arms. <hi>Will they</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>be terrified with an empty
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53750:107"/>
name and Authority without force, and at the ſight of the Popes Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, which upon the firſt Invaſion muſt implore aſſiſtance from</hi> Feria, <hi>and under the ſhadow of the power of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>repair themſelves of their loſſes and wrong? Will</hi> Gregory <hi>then in the utmoſt of his life cut off Peace betwixt his Children, making himſelf a Party, and leave to his Succeſſor a lamentable Inheritance of War and Troubles. And take it for granted, that the Confederates would ſuffer it, the Proteſtants yet were not like to endure it; but at the name alone of the Enſigns of the Church would come down in Troops to oppoſe them. That</hi> Helvetia <hi>was near; the Princes of the Empire not yet ſuppreſſed;</hi> Mansfelt <hi>had his Arms in his hands; all greedy, and longing to over-run</hi> Italy, <hi>and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief the moſt ſacred Seat of Religion and the Apoſtolate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The offices of the Confederates joyned their aſſiſtance to theſe apprehenſions, and in particular the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who, ſending <hi>Girola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Soranzo</hi> Cavalier, Ambaſſadour Extraordinary to <hi>Rome,</hi> diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Pope from lending his Name and Authority to the Intereſts of <hi>Spain.</hi> But he, environed by his Nephews, and they gained by <hi>Spain</hi> with Benefices, Penſions, and the Marriage of the Princeſs of <hi>Venoſa,</hi> Vaſſal of the Monarchy, believed that the Princes made ſuch a noiſe only to fright him, and that at the appearing of his Colours all their Arms out of veneration would fall out of their hands, there remaining to him, as an ornament to his Name and a Crown upon his Sepulchre, the glorious Memorial of Peace preſerved, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion protected. The truſt then was accepted by him, upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a Treaty of Agreement betwixt the two Kings ſhould be purſued, and when without the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being in fault, it ſhould not be concluded, that the Forts ſhould then be reſtored to them again. This being treated in <hi>Rome, Feria</hi> perſwades the <hi>Griſons,</hi> under pretext of moderating the Articles heretofore concluded, to ſend to him new Ambaſſadours, to bind ſo much the faſter the knots of ſervitude and dependance. <hi>Leopold</hi> raiſes at <hi>Steich</hi> a very good Fort, and there was publiſhed an Inveſtiture of the Emperour, which granted to the Houſe of <hi>Trivultia,</hi> according to a certain pretenſion they had, the Valley of <hi>Muſoccho,</hi> The <hi>French</hi> ſhewed themſelves much moved, that before a Reſolution taken upon the Depoſition, <hi>Gregory</hi> had not expected the ſenſe of that Crown upon it. But in the counſel opinions were divided according to affections, ſome vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to break off all Treaty, and with a ſudden march of Troops hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Popes meddling, and the execution of the Truſt it ſelf. Others were of opinion, that the Depoſition ſhould be approved with certain limitations and reſerves, and thoſe counſels taking place which ſquared with the favour; for <hi>Piſieux</hi> was Author of them, in whoſe inclinations, both in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> were grounded their greateſt hopes, it paſſed ſo.</p>
               <p>It was then by the <hi>French</hi> declared, <hi>That the Depoſition ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main until the end of</hi> July (it was now the month of <hi>May) within which time, the Forts being demoliſhed, and all reſtraints upon the</hi> Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>and Armies removed which did oppreſs them, affairs ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their former ſtate, which not being performed, the League
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53750:107"/>
ſhould ſupplicate the Pope to joyn himſelf to their Arms, thereby to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the effect.</hi> Before ſuch opinions were repreſented to the Pope, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> getting notice of them, proceeded to haſten the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition with ſo much precipitation, that notwithſtanding the indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition into which <hi>Gregory</hi> was at that time deſperately fallen, the Cardinal <hi>Lodoviſio</hi> orders, that the Duke <hi>de Fiano,</hi> the Popes own Brother, with fifteen hundred Foot, and five hundred Horſe ſhould march towards <hi>Milan.</hi> He being a perſon of moſt ſottiſh parts, with the aſſiſtance nevertheleſs of ſome of better abilities, ſerved only to make ſurer the engagement, and to conciliate ſome reſpect to thoſe Troops. But being arrived in the Valley, he found that the people fearing to fall under another Dominion than that of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the number of two thouſand, took Arms and reſolved to oppoſe him; but all obſtacles being removed by the authority of the Governor of <hi>Milan,</hi> he enters into the Forts, <hi>Feria</hi> himſelf furniſhing Ammunition and Victuals, and keeping beſides with his own Garriſons thoſe of <hi>Chiavena, Riva,</hi> and <hi>Bormio; Fiano</hi> nevertheleſs returns preſently to <hi>Rome,</hi> leaving in the Valley for the command of the Troops <hi>Nic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colo,</hi> one of the Marqueſſes of <hi>Bagni,</hi> and at <hi>Milan Monſieur Scappi</hi> to reſide with the Governour. In the mean time, at <hi>Rome</hi> the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour <hi>Sillery,</hi> preventing thoſe Orders which the Miniſters of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> expected, performs himſelf alone the Commiſſions of the Court to the Pope, changing them, inſtructed (as was believed) by <hi>Piſieux,</hi> by approving the Depoſition without limitation of time, and without the requiring of thoſe things which the Collegiates were to demand; but by adding only an intreaty for the ſpeedy demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the Forts and reſtitution, with thoſe conditions for Religion which <hi>Gregory</hi> ſhould preſcribe.</p>
               <p>Before the Pope could anſwer hereupon, God, upon the 8. of <hi>July,</hi> calls for him for the depoſition of his life, after having held rather than exerciſed a little more than two years the name and authority of the Apoſtolate. A Pope that in matters of Religion left a fame of much zeal, imployed with great applauſe in Wars of <hi>Germany,</hi> and ſpread abroad by the Congregation by him founded, for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Faith amongſt the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> On the other ſide, as to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, he was taxed to have been of a mean ſpirit, and totally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the will of his Nephews, amongſt which the Cardinal direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed affairs with ſuch an abſolute power, that in the ſhort time of his Uncles Pontificate procuring vaſt riches to his houſe, he minded lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle elſe but the heaping up wealth and honours. The ſtate of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and of <hi>Italy</hi> ſolicitouſly required the Election of a new Pope; nevertheleſs amidſt ſo many affections and intereſts of Princes, and by reaſon of the forms, with ſecret ſcrutinies preſcribed by <hi>Gregory</hi> in his <hi>Bull,</hi> it was doubted it would be long a doing.</p>
               <p>But upon the 6. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Election, where opinions and minds leaſt inclined, fell upon <hi>Maffeo,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Barberino,</hi> by Country a <hi>Florentine,</hi> of the age of fifty and ſix years, to the wonder of the Electors themſelves, who were amazed to have deceived their own hopes by promoting a perſon, who for his complexion and vigour
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53750:108"/>
might out-live the greater part of them. He takes the name of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> the Eighth with the applauſe of the World, by reaſon of the high conceit of his Learning and Ability.</p>
               <p>And now in <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Anthonio Priuli</hi> Duke deceaſed, loaden with years and deſerts was ſuſtituted <hi>Franceſo Contarini</hi> Cavalier Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, ſignal for many publick Employments, and for having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone Embaſſies in almoſt all the Courts of <hi>Europe</hi> with ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and innocency, that nothing could be condemned in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or accuſed in his manners. One of the firſt cares in his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality was to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> the four elected Ambaſſadours, according to cuſtom, to venerate the High Prieſt, and they were <hi>Franceſco Erizzo</hi> Cavalier, Procurator, <hi>Renieri Zeno, Girolamo Soranzo</hi> both Cavaliers, and <hi>Girolamo Cornaro,</hi> who were ſo much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed as <hi>Sillery</hi> proceeded with luke-warmneſs.</p>
               <p>The Pope, to ſay truth, deteſted the engagement into which his Predeceſſor had put the Arms and Authority of the Church; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the unſeaſonable charge, but found no way to get out, <hi>Lodoviſio</hi> having ſtrongly tied the knot both of the buſineſs and decency; that although <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> by reaſon of imployments had in that Court, was thought inclined to <hi>France,</hi> and in a manner par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, it was nevertheleſs fit to be ſerviceable in name to the aims and deſigns of <hi>Spain.</hi> But however time run on to the prejudice of thoſe affairs, no man in theſe beginnings durſt irritate or provoke the Pope; ſo that the <hi>Griſons</hi> groaned under the burden, <hi>Leopold</hi> continued in poſſeſſion, and <hi>Feria,</hi> bating the appearance, enjoyed the conveniences and advantages which he had by the <hi>Valteline</hi> propoſed.</p>
               <p>Nor did the diverſion of <hi>Mansfelt</hi> come to any thing; for although he had received from the Confederates their money, yet believing to make War in <hi>Germany</hi> with more profit to himſelf, and being ſtirred up by the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the Proteſtants of the <hi>Lower Saxony</hi> was marched into the County of <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> and having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted great Contributions there, leaving Garriſons in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had entred into <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Munſter.</hi> On another ſide <hi>Halberſtat,</hi> ſeparate in Forces, but with the ſame ends, and with the ſame ſupplies from the Biſhoprick of <hi>Oſnabrug,</hi> threatned to advance into the <hi>Palatinate</hi> with thirty thouſand men, moſt new raiſed, ill furniſhed with warlike Proviſions, and with but a few Cannon. <hi>Tilly,</hi> inferiour in number, but better provided, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Valour and military Diſcipline, marches ſpeedily towards him, taking his paſſage through the Country of <hi>Haſſia,</hi> mortifying the <hi>Landgrave,</hi> who had had the ſtoutneſs to deny it him with oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and contributions, and indeed terrifying with his fame the whole Proteſtant Union. He overtakes him in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Munster,</hi> and doubtful whether he ſhould go forwards towards the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> or bend towards <hi>Holland,</hi> provokes him to battel, he avoiding it with that diſadvantage which he always hath who retires and gives way. Coming at laſt cloſe up to him at <hi>Burſteinfurt,</hi> a place of no note, whilſt he was marching towards <hi>Statlo</hi> through a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53750:108"/>
winding way, interrupted with certain ſmall Rivers, which forming in ſeveral places dams and ditches, gave him the opportunity to make a ſtand; then facing about, and leaving a ſtrong defence there, aſſure both the Reer and this March. But the Catholicks preſſed ſo hard upon him, that overcoming all obſtacles, and the reſſiſtance which was made them at the River <hi>Aa,</hi> they came at laſt at <hi>Statlo</hi> upon the River <hi>Berchel</hi> the 6. of <hi>August</hi> to a general Battel, in which being defeated, leaving ſix thouſand dead upon the place, beſides four thouſand which rendred themſelves Priſoners, and the reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſperſed, eighty Colours, Cannon, Baggage, and the glory of the Victory were the prey of the Conquerours. <hi>Halberſtat</hi> then with two Companies of Horſe flyes into <hi>Holland,</hi> giving <hi>Tilly</hi> liberty to re take many places in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> in which he and <hi>Mansfelt</hi> had their Garriſons. <hi>Tilly</hi> hereupon meditates on a great deſign to make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Embden,</hi> and from thence through <hi>Frizland</hi> to paſs into the bowels of the United Provinces of <hi>Holland,</hi> ſo to retribute to the advantage of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that powerful aſſiſtance they had given <hi>Ferdinand;</hi> but the <hi>Hollanders</hi> furniſhed the place with all ſorts of proviſions, ſending thither men and a Squadron of Ships of War, ſolliciting alſo <hi>Mansfelt</hi> for its relief, and conſenting ſix thouſand men to <hi>Haverstadt</hi> to repair his Army. For theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>Tilly,</hi> ſeeing the enterpriſe difficult, and of a longer continuance than the approaching ſeaſon of the Winter did permit, returns to take Quarters in <hi>Haſſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor had <hi>Mansfelt</hi> better luck; for <hi>Cordua,</hi> having in <hi>Westphalia</hi> reduced many Garriſons of places, partly poſſeſſed by him, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly protected by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> with great facility every other place, except <hi>Lipstat,</hi> which made ſome defence, yielded. At laſt the Count of <hi>Anhalt</hi> and Colonel <hi>Erwits</hi> took <hi>Mansfelt</hi> in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Munster,</hi> at ſuch a diſadvantage of ſituation and numbers, that he was wholly defeated, Heaven making War for the Imperialiſts with ſuch partiality of favours, that they publickly boaſted, That the juſtice of their cauſe was decided by the felicity of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes.</p>
               <p>The Imperialiſts alſo perſwaded <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> to be quiet; for he propoſing to himſelf either to make a ſhort War or Peace, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained the <hi>Turks</hi> conſent by the means of the Count <hi>de la Tour,</hi> who went to the Port for that purpoſe, had invaded <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Moravia.</hi> But it being divulged, that <hi>Tilly</hi> having the fame of ſo many Victories his fore-runners, was coming to their relief, he retired into his own Country, and applies himſelf to new agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He had alſo in this year ſent <hi>Stephano Attuani,</hi> his Miniſter of moſt truſt, to <hi>Venice,</hi> to demand a League and aſſiſtance, but without effect; becauſe the Senate purpoſed to be attentive obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of, but not be intangled in foreign occurrences ſo far diſtant from them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But the Confederates, propoſing to themſelves the end of reſtoring things to their former ſtate, judged they ſhould be wanting to the protection promiſed to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and nevertheleſs feared, leſt the <hi>Valteline,</hi> not being able to ſubſiſt of it ſelf, as a body apart, ſhould uphold it ſelf by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by which means taking away the cover of the name, they ſhould ſtill enjoy predominancy over their minds, the convenience and liberty of the paſſage to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of all others. Nor could this chief intereſt be longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed; becauſe, it being at laſt propoſed in the name of the <hi>Pope,</hi> that paſſage through the Valley ſhould remain free for the Souldiery of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> it gave the Confederates occaſion to conclude thereupon, that the ſubtle pretext of Religion being now removed, the Intereſt ſeemed diſcovered to tend to the ſubjecting no leſs of <hi>Italy</hi> than of <hi>Germany,</hi> by the uniting of Countries, and opening a door to over-run the one and the other at their pleaſure.

the Ambaſſadour <hi>Sillery,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Gheffier,</hi> who was at that time at <hi>Rome,</hi> although he could not but know <hi>France</hi> more prejudiced than any others, both by the blow which its Confederates would feel within and without <hi>Italy,</hi> and the breach which would be made into that moſt ancient League with the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> by vertue whereof the abſolute diſpoſition of the Paſſes was aſcribed to them, readily conſents to it, to the ſo much diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the other Princes united, that attributing all to <hi>Piſieux,</hi> from whoſe Judgment and Pen, by reaſon of the favour and his charge the buſineſs depended, they reſolved to diſcover the Plot to the King himſelf, giving him to underſtand the alterations with which they had proceeded at <hi>Rome,</hi> from what had been concerted at <hi>Paris,</hi> ſetting at naught the Princes who were their friends, neglecting the Intereſts of the Crown it ſelf, and having by a moſt deſtructive conſent conducted the buſineſs to that very end which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters directed.</p>
               <p>Concerning <hi>Piſieux,</hi> beſides the hatred and envy, which are the wonted followers of favour, a common opinion was currant, that he was not more powerful in the Kings favour, than venal in his Miniſtry, making uſe of his Authority rather for profit than honour. Being therefore not at all acceptable beſides to the great men of the Kingdom, it proved no hard matter for the Miniſters of the Princes, and in particular <hi>Giovanni Peſari,</hi> Ambaſſadour of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> by their Offices and wonted Arts to help forward the ſecret Intrigues of Court, which diſcovering themſelves of a ſudden, his Fortune ſplit in a moment, the King intimating to him, that he and the Chancellor his Father ſhould preſently leave the Court.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſs <hi>de la Vieuville,</hi> Superintendant of the Finances, took quickly poſſeſſion of the favour, and in the little time he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, by the Marriage with <hi>England,</hi> and other means, laid the foundations of thoſe contrivances, perfected afterwards by his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor with great felicity. But the affections of the King towards Favourites having hitherto proved but ſhort and unhappy, he continued but a few months. Some aſcribed his fall to covetouſneſs, by which he provoked the hatred of the great ones, accuſtomed to ſatisfie their private intereſts out of the publick Treaſury. Others judged, that one ingratitude being commonly the puniſhment of another, as he had lent his hand to the expulſion of <hi>Piſieux,</hi> the Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of his Fortune, ſo the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> introduced by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to buſineſs, quickly excluded him.</p>
               <p>This Cardinal is the perſon called elſewhere the Biſhop of <hi>Luſſon,</hi> and there is no doubt, that, as for the moſt part in the choice of great Miniſters the judgment of the Princes agree with thoſe of their Subjects, though ſoon after they differ in the maintaining of them, he was not ordained for that place from applauſe or common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but was brought into it chiefly by the ſavour of the Queen-Mother, with whom he had been long exerciſed in all ſorts of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance. The King ſurely had no inclinations to him, either for having in former Negotiations diſcovered the ſagacity of his nature,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53750:110"/>
or becauſe there is a certain natural ſecret averſion to thoſe, who with an aſcendant of wit exceed. Sure it is, that the Cardinal poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed rather the power of the favour than the favour it ſelf, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he had the great Art how to fix the mutable and ſuſpicious Genius of the King, and the inconſtant nature of the people, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as with a ſupreme Dictatorſhip the one and the other even to his death.</p>
               <p>But as to the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> by the diſgrace of <hi>Piſieux,</hi> the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter being changed, there was a change alſo at <hi>Rome</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Treaty, and <hi>Sillery</hi> being recalled, all that was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowed, which he had negotiated and conſented to. <hi>Monſieur de Bethune,</hi> a Miniſter formerly well known in <hi>Italy,</hi> being come to <hi>Rome</hi> in his place, aſſures the Pope, that all that which his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor had approved, concerning the Paſſes, was wholly againſt the Kings m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd; and in the name of the Confederates expreſſing to the holy See unalterable duty, and ready conſent to that which might ſecure Religion in the Valley, as to the reſt refuſes any expedient, which did not deliver the <hi>Griſons</hi> from the preſent oppreſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them to their Country and Soveraignty, and did not exclude the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from the Paſſes. They publiſhed this change of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to be a ſhift; but the Pope, who had made them deliver to him <hi>Riva</hi> alſo and <hi>Chiavena,</hi> endeavoured to gain time, perceiving, that to which ſoever of the Parties he ſhould give the poſſeſſion of the Forts, it would ſerve but for a pretext to kindle a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous War, which flaming out betwixt the two Crowns, by Auxiliary Forces, would quickly extend it ſelf throughout all <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor did the <hi>Spaniards</hi> now fail, as they had ſucceeded in the gaining of the Cardinal <hi>Lodoviſio</hi> with Rewards and Marriages, to try every way to inſnare the <hi>Barberins</hi> alſo, giving hopes to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbans</hi> Nephews of the Princeſs <hi>Stigliana,</hi> who being an Inheritrix of vaſt Territories in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> brought alſo in Dowry the Soveraignty of the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Sabioneda.</hi> Some alſo ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Pope and to his Houſe hopes, that amidſt the jealouſies and diſſenſions of the Princes, he might have the hap to get himſelf glory, by uniting the Valley to the Church, or obtain advantages by inveſting his Kindred in it. But the one and the other equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed the Confederates; becauſe no leſs ſuſpicious was the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral greatneſs of the Popes, who, protected by the Cloak of Religion, cannot make War themſelves without danger, nor overcome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame, then the inclination of the Nephews doubtful, it being not poſſible for him that poſſeſſes the Valley, but to depend upon the protection and aſſiſtance of the Governour of <hi>Milan.</hi> Nothing then remained but the cloſing in a War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France,</hi> before ingaging out of the Kingdom, ſtrengthens it ſelf with two great and important Treaties. The firſt with the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Holland,</hi> to whom were promiſed three millions and two hundred thouſand <hi>Livres Tournois</hi> to be paid in three years, upon condition not to make Peace or Truce with <hi>Spain</hi> without their knowledge; and if it ſhould ſo fall out, that <hi>France</hi> it ſelf ſhould
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53750:110"/>
have need of aſſiſtance, they were to retribute it either by reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the half of the foreſaid ſum, or by furniſhing Ships in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The other was the Marriage of <hi>Henrietta,</hi> Siſter of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> with <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> from which was derived a report, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would break into a War with <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Palatine</hi> be reſtored into his Country by Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles,</hi> to ſay truth, from his Voyage into <hi>Spain</hi> had brought back diſcontent, hatred, and deſire of revenge againſt that Crown; for though he were received at <hi>Madrid</hi> with all poſſible honours, he nevertheleſs penetrated the intention not to reſtore his Country to <hi>Frederick,</hi> nor conclude the Marriage for which the King, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs her ſelf, <hi>Olivares</hi> and all the Kingdoms had in their hearts a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular averſion. Being for ſome months amuſed with ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, and a difficulty which they feigned came to them from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> though to remove it, he was induced to write him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Pope, and tempted at laſt, if he would have a Wife, to change his Religion, he parted in great haſte, returning to <hi>London</hi> by Sea. It is not poſſible to expreſs, what diſdain vexed the heart of that young Prince, and King <hi>James</hi> with no leſs vehemency pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his revenge, having a mind in his old age to adorn his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre with thoſe reſentments, which in the courſe of his Reign, having been blunted by idleneſs, ſeemed to have blemiſhed the glory of his life. For this purpoſe he calls a Parliament, in which <hi>Buckingham</hi> having juſtified, with a zeal to common good, and a deſire of Peace, the Kings intentions concerning the Marriage with <hi>Spain;</hi> and rendred an account of the Princes Voyage, it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Kings Son-in-law ſhould be reſtored into his Country by Arms, and that the Son ſhould marry with a Princeſs of the Blood Royal of <hi>France.</hi> But it being uſual in <hi>England,</hi> that Parliaments have an equal ſuſpicion of their Kings, when they are armed, as Kings have of Parliaments, when they are united, it was preſently deſolved; many jealouſies being ſpread abroad, which were belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fomented, at leaſt, if not raiſed by the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> as if the Parliament, adhering to the youthful age of <hi>Charles,</hi> and with applauſe flattering that Generoſity, which he ſhewed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf, would condemn the cooler proceedings and paſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the King, in whoſe life time they were diſpoſing the ſpoils and Funerals of his Authority and Command. But withal the means were not ripened, nor the contributions conſented, which might raiſe and keep on foot an Army. So that as the Marriage with <hi>Henrietta</hi> was eaſily concluded, with a diſpence from the Pope, and many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of favour to the conſciences of the Catholicks, ſo the moving of Arms quickly vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>It is notwithſtanding true, that <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> beaten in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in <hi>Holland</hi> not willingly ſuffered by <hi>Orange,</hi> through emulation of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary glory and the applauſe of the people, was called into <hi>England</hi> by the King, where being received with great honour, making him his General for the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> he ordains him an Army of ten thouſand Foot and three thouſand Horſe, with ſix
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53750:111"/>
pieces of Cannon, if <hi>France</hi> would concur with a Force proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. Sending him with this Propoſition to King <hi>Lewis,</hi> who profeſſed himſelf diſguſted with the Count, becauſe he had taken the Title of the Kings General without his knowledge; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he went to <hi>London,</hi> had forbid him coming into <hi>France,</hi> he obtains to be admitted to treat with his Miniſters, denying him his own preſence. He was ſupplied with ſome money by the <hi>French</hi> with promiſes of more, though in effect they had little fervency in the intereſt of the <hi>Palatine.</hi> But for <hi>Italy,</hi> having ſecured all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him by the friendſhip of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the flank by the War of <hi>Flanders,</hi> they applied themſelves with more warmth to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the <hi>Valteline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> imployed all care with the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to unite them in the common Intereſt. But ſucceeded no further, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> to compoſe betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (excluding the Mediation of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters) the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences ſo long in queſtion, upon terms, that for the pretended Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Bianca, Ferdinand</hi> ſhould diſburſe to <hi>Carlo</hi> three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns, a third whereof within the ſpace of four years Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and the reſt with the Dowry of <hi>Margaret;</hi> Moveables and Jewels ſhould be ſatisfied in ſo much Land in <hi>Monſerrat</hi> near to <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> to be ſet out by the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> valuing the Rent at two <hi>per Cent.</hi> For a greater confirmation of the agreement, there was a promiſe of reciprocal Marriages, of <hi>Mary</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Mantua</hi> with <hi>Filibert</hi> Son of <hi>Carlo,</hi> and of one of the <hi>Infanta's</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> with him that ſhould be Heir of the Dominions of the States of the Houſe of <hi>Gonzagha.</hi> This notwithſtanding was not to be executed but within the ſpace of eight years, neither was there other difference in the Dowries of two hundred thouſand Crowns for each, but that <hi>Carlo</hi> was to pay in ready money, and to receive in Lands. When therefore the Prince <hi>Vincenzo</hi> of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſhould ſucceed, as he hoped, in diſſolving, under pretence of ſterility, a certain Bond, and, as he pretended, invalid Marriage, formerly contracted out of an amorous paſſion with the Widow <hi>Iſabella,</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Bozzolo,</hi> the <hi>Infanta</hi> was to be his; but that not following, or <hi>Ferdinand</hi> having no Child Male, the other was yet to be accompliſhed with <hi>Filibert.</hi> In order to this agreement, <hi>Carlo</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> yield the pretenſions on <hi>Monſerrat</hi> to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> to his Brother and to their Children, and this was to take place, though by death or other diſturbance, the foreſaid Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages ſhould not ſucceed. In ſum, the conſent of the Emperour, as Soveraign of the States, was to be aſked, and out of reſpect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication given to both the Crowns. Such were the conditions concluded on and ſubſcribed, by which the ancient diſſentions of both Houſes were hoped to have been quieted; but to the deluſion of humane wiſdom, that which was believed an Antidote, was ſoon converted into the venemous ſeed of greater evils.</p>
               <p>Amongſt various accidents, the firſt was the death of <hi>Filibert;</hi> for although <hi>Carlo,</hi> ſending his Secretary <hi>Pater</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> offered to ſubſtitute <hi>Maurice</hi> his other Son to the Marriage, nevertheleſs the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53750:111"/>
buſineſs fatally ſucceeded not, Heaven diſpoſing new Thunder-claps for <hi>Italy</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Gonzagha.</hi> The minds then of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, being by ſuch Negotiations forced for the preſent from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral cares, applying themſelves in earneſt to the <hi>Valteline</hi> and to Arms, cauſed the delivery of the Forts to be demanded of the Pope, that according to the League they might be demoliſhed, and the Valley reſtored to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> or elſe that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould within three months execute the Treaty of <hi>Madrid;</hi> but the Pope himſelf oppoſing the firſt Propoſition, and not being able to bring the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the other, it was replied unto him, That the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates found themſelves neceſſitated for their own ſafety, not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving place to other expedients, to apply to more effectual remedies. King <hi>Lewis</hi> had ſent into <hi>Helvetia</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>de Coevre,</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to him the charge of the Treaty and direction of the War. He and <hi>Girolamo Cavazza,</hi> Reſident for the Republick in <hi>Zurich,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the oppoſition of the Popes and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, by effectual offices, and to take away all pretexts, perſwaded the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Cantons</hi> to perform the caution required in the Treaty of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the Proteſtants to take Arms, and permit Levies of men, proviſions of Victuals, and other neceſſaries. They warily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards took upon them under-hand to animate the <hi>Griſons,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the oppreſſed, raiſe up the commons, recal the baniſhed and fugitives out of the Country, to the end they might joyn with the Arms of the Confederates to ſhake off their yoke, and drive away the Enemy. <hi>Feria,</hi> ſtirred with great apprehenſions upon the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of <hi>Coevre</hi> at <hi>Soluturno,</hi> orders Recruits, and to keep the people of <hi>Rhetia</hi> quiet, threatens them with grievous miſchiefs, <hi>Leopold</hi> alſo proteſting no leſs chaſtiſements, notwithſtanding that he had ſtipulated another agreement with them, in which, upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſement of ſome thouſands of Florins, he promiſed to take the Garriſons out of <hi>Majanfelt</hi> and <hi>Coira.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Princes of the League being now reſolved to take Arms, agreed to make the War under the name of the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> levying three thouſand men of each of the two Nations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcing them afterwards with twelve hundred Foot, and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe of the <hi>French,</hi> and with another body of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Troops, of which the groſs and thoſe of <hi>Carlo</hi> were to keep upon the Borders of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> ſo long as the Royal Troops ſhould lie incamped in the Province of <hi>Breſcia;</hi> but the Confederates conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to proceed towards the ſame end, with deſigns and means dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; for <hi>France,</hi> abhorring an open breach with <hi>Spain,</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to manage the War, but by Auxiliary Forces, and without ingaging his own Troops ſo far off, with little charge and leſs noiſe, at the coſt of the other Confederates, eſpecially the <hi>Venetians</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at his purpoſe. The <hi>Venetians</hi> not aſpiring, the affairs of the <hi>Griſons</hi> being reſtored, ſo to ought, but to confirm the Peace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that the enterpriſe might have carried reputation and vigour with it, ſo to have obtained the one and the other with equal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and diſpatch. And <hi>Carlo</hi> concurred rather in name than with
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53750:112"/>
his Forces, buſying his thoughts in nothing but to bring the Crowns to an open breach in <hi>Italy;</hi> for being ſituated in the middle, as in a manner Guardian and Arbiter of the War or Peace, whatever the event ſhould happen to be, he hoped to make his profit, and ſerve himſelf of the Arms of others, principally of the <hi>French,</hi> for his own advantage. He repreſented to the King and to the Senate how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial it would be to ingage, and as it were bury Armies in a Country, as <hi>Rhetia</hi> was, barren and ſtraight, how burdenſom to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Troops idle upon their own Frontiers. He remonſtrated to what charge the Confederates expoſed themſelves, and amidſt what difficulties they would be ſtraightned, if they aſpired no higher than relieving the <hi>Valteline</hi> and defending themſelves. Was it poſſibly to be believed, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would ſit down with one blow, or that they would be frighted with the name of this Alliance? Their intention was nothing ſo, and being not inferiour in art and force, knew how to make uſe of them according to the change of times, never neglecting occaſions, or loſing advantages. When could they have greater hopes to atchieve great deſigns; ſince the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> looſned from ſo many vexatious reſpects, have at laſt had the courage to take hands with Strangers, and in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, make plain the way to their relief? The Duke laid great weight upon this Union, and the reflections were not of leſs moment; for, if when the World adored <hi>Spain</hi> in the height of its proſperity and greatneſs, he with his own Forces and the gold of the Republick had been able to reſiſt, what might they not promiſe themſelves at preſent from the powerful aſſiſtances of the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> whilſt <hi>England, Holland,</hi> the Kingdoms of the North, and the Proteſtants conſpired in the ſame deſigns? He ſhewed how <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> was divided, and that the Party, which bore Arms againſt the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> was much ſtronger than that which was ſubjected to their power; for he deſigned, that on the one ſide <hi>Mansfelt</hi> ſhould make a diverſion in <hi>Burgundy, Hungary</hi> on the other ſhould be inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Tranſilvanian,</hi> the War ſhould be continued in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Flanders;</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> with the Princes of the <hi>Lower Saxony,</hi> ſhould make War in the Empire, and the Seas and Coaſts of <hi>Spain</hi> be infeſted by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet. Whence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that they were to remain always in fear, or at once make themſelves to be feared, the opportunity was now offered by a great War to free themſelves from greater dangers, and ſeizing ſpeedily the Paſſes of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and excluding ſuccours, invade power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> which is its Center, for the Conqueſts whereof he generouſly offered his Forces, his Countries, and his own perſon, preferring Glory and Liberty before idleneſs and the greateſt dangers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> haply might not have been averſe from ſuch counſels, although they knew the attempt laborious and difficult, (from the diſguſts which now for a long time had rendred the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armies ſo troubleſom and grievous) if the <hi>French</hi> had been ſincerely willing to imploy their utmoſt power;
<pb facs="tcp:53750:112"/>
but they, keeping to their aim not to break openly with <hi>Spain,</hi> gave it ſufficiently to be underſtood, that by engaging their friends more than themſelves, they deſired to have them Dependants rather than Confederates. The Duke then, who was wont to have ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in a readineſs, to the end that amidſt many attempts, Fortune might favour ſome one, knowing <hi>France,</hi> as much impatient of quiet, as irreſolute to the War, projected with ſubtil reaches of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and advantage, that the Crown would at leaſt undertake the Conqueſt of <hi>Genoua.</hi> He had obſerved from a long time with a covetous eye that City grown rich by their long Peace, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try open, the Citizens at diſcord; and his avarice was fomented by <hi>Claudio Marini,</hi> a <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> but Ledger Ambaſſadour with him for the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> who, ill ſatisfied with his own Country, fought amidſt the ruines of it, either to exalt his name, or bury the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fortune of his native Country. He offered Intelligences, and ſerved as an inſtrument to corrupt ſeveral, in particular has own Kindred; whereupon, by the heat of his inclinations, the Duke earneſtly preſſed King <hi>Lewis,</hi> that if he would not ſpread his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours againſt the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> he would at leaſt lend them him to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them againſt the <hi>Genoueſe.</hi> This he looked at to be a meet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in favour of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> which was ſought elſewhere in vain; whilſt by this Conqueſt, <hi>Milan</hi> being diſarmed of its Forces, and the Monarchy of money, the Mines would hardly ſupply, nor the <hi>Indies</hi> ſatisfie contingencies and other vaſt expences, if the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> with equal care and covetouſneſs, did not provide Treaſures for the Gulph of Wars. They ſqueez out the wealth of others to pour it forth into <hi>Spain,</hi> who, with the money of all, makes War to all. What was there to be expected from that Government where private intereſt ſetting publick liberty to ſale, that of others is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced. Their Ports were open to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleets, their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies augmented the Kings Squadrons, Paſſage was free, Quarters ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, their friendſhip was by obligation, their wills obedient, the chief ones were ready, and private men, no leſs either to ſerve in perſon in their Armies, or maintain them with their Riches.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genoueſe</hi> then was to be invaded, not only as the door, but as part of the Domination of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> by the taking whereof the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> is encompaſſed, Succours are cut off, Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, Commerce, Navigation, and Aids are all broken. That that River was a Line, which to force it had no greater difficulty, but to attempt it; a ſhort march would bring the Army under the Walls of the City, great in circuit, ſtrong by ſituation, but by the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Country, may be ſaid beſieged.

once attempted to ſell their liberty with their Country. Let <hi>France</hi> call to mind the Dominion it once had over that State, awaken its Rights, extend its Frontiers into the Land and Sea; replant the Flower-de-luces in <hi>Italy,</hi> and greatning it ſelf with ſo glorious a Conqueſt, ſatiate his Armies with the ſpoils of the richeſt <hi>Emporium</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> All this was ſuggeſted by the Duke, and to him by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and intereſt, although he endeavoured to hide it with the cauſe of <hi>Zuccarello,</hi> elſewhere mentioned to be a little and ignoble Fief of the Empire in the Mountains, but eſteemed by the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> important; becauſe it lies in their bowels, by that fatality which <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> hath always been ſubject to, that things in themſelves but ſmall, being eſteemed great by their Princes, have frequently opened the way to Strangers to uſurp the greateſt part of it. It was anciently the poſſeſſion of the Family of <hi>Carretta,</hi> and the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly attempted to get a right to it. They in particular bought of <hi>Scipio,</hi> one of the Marqueſſes, a certain annual Rent, with a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of preference, in caſe the Fief it ſelf ſhould one day come to be ſold. But it happened that the ſame <hi>Scipio,</hi> to prevent an Imperial Sentence which he feared in puniſhment for a murder he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ſold it to the <hi>Savoyards.</hi> The Emperour nevertheleſs, not enduring a fraud ſo manifeſt, calls the buſineſs to himſelf, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the care of it to the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> who aſpired to it. At laſt being ſold in theſe late times by Confiſcation, it was not doubted but the gold and favour of the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> contributed much to it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the conſideration of not enlarging the Duke in that Quarter, whence he might have been able to infeſt them, and greaten himſelf. All this was publiſhed by the Duke with a great train of proteſts and reaſons, to which he added other diſguſts, ſeeing himſelf hated by the Government of <hi>Genoua</hi> and the people, and his name and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation on all occaſions vilified. Nevertheleſs the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeemed to be, that he rather ſought an occaſion for War, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he had cauſe for it. But in <hi>France,</hi> although the Crown, beſides an univerſal inclination of the more powerful to oppreſs the weak, had no other cauſe of enmity with the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepancy of intereſts and affections, the thoughts of <hi>Carlo</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, and his propoſitions embraced, if for no other, yet at leaſt to give exerciſe and vent to the minds now inflamed amidſt theſe <hi>Preludiums</hi> to War.</p>
               <p>But to the end all the League might concur therein, the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals were carried to the <hi>Venetians</hi> with a differing ſucceſs; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> had made themſelves believe, that mindful of ancient emulations, they would eaſily have aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet thoſe animoſities, (as good as cancelled by time and the long Peace) being in the Senate, put in ballance with the motives of equity and common intereſt, <hi>Giovanna Baſadonna,</hi> in oppoſition to ſome who did conſent to it, ſpake to this purpoſe. <hi>Ought we then to revenge the provocations and jealouſies of the</hi> Auſtrians <hi>upon a State that is innocent? Oh how pernicious ſhall the example be to all, if the opportunity of a ſituation and the Wealth of a State ſhall be a ſufficient
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53750:113"/>
argument to raiſe a War. It is true, that the</hi> Genoueſe <hi>are bound up to</hi> Spain, <hi>but the fear and neceſſity into which we have a mind to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate them, is not the means to looſen them from thoſe Chains. If they lend their Ports at preſent and conſent paſſage, they will then think it neceſſary to accept Garriſon. If private men contribute money, we ſhall conſtrain the publick to receive the Law. Doth the League on the one ſide pretend with applauſe to drive the</hi> Spaniards <hi>out of the</hi> Valteline, <hi>exclude the</hi> Auſtrians <hi>out of</hi> Rhetia, <hi>redeem the</hi> Griſons, <hi>and reſtore them to their liberty and dominion; and on the other, ſhall it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice attempt to oppreſs</hi> Genoua, <hi>to extinguiſh a Republick, and change perhaps the name but not the ſubjection of</hi> Italy? <hi>But what do I ſay to Conqueſts? We ſhall ſee that inſtead of moderating the Command of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>too too burdenſom to that afficted Country, it will without diſpute increaſe with a new and greater dependancy under the ſpecious title of defence. Who knows but that the</hi> Genoueſe <hi>may one day mind again their fortune, and that</hi> Italy, <hi>coming to change its aſpect, may not reſtore luſtre to their Government? But let us not loſe the hope for ever, if to the bonds of gold, by which ſome are bound at preſent, we ſhall joyn thoſe of Iron into which the danger drives them with miſery to all. The propoſed Conqueſt is not ſo eaſie as by the</hi> French <hi>and</hi> Savoyards <hi>we hear deſcribed. The Territory of</hi> Genoua <hi>is made ſtrong by ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and defended by Nature. The City by its greatneſs and popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is able to maintain it ſelf; the Sea being open, will furniſh ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours; the</hi> Milaneſe <hi>being near, will contribute aſſiſtance. And what will become of</hi> Carlo, <hi>if he ſhould find himſelf environed on all ſides by the</hi> Spaniards <hi>and</hi> Genoueſe, <hi>and perhaps left as a prey to dangers by the</hi> French <hi>from their natural inconſtancy? It is no ſhort nor eaſie work to over-turn a Government radicated by time, nouriſhed by good Laws, and ſtrengthened by the thoughts, or at leaſt the imagination of a peaceable liberty. The people will reſiſt the change of Government, and falling under the Domination of a Prince they hate. The Citizens will be obſtinate in defending themſelves; and although the imployments of the</hi> Spaniards <hi>in</hi> Rhetia, <hi>or elſewhere, ſhould interrupt or retard the ſuccours, a State that is rich hath, when put to it, Garriſon and Relief within it ſelf. With what hopes will our Republick participate in this deſign? Will it peradventure aſpire to ſo difficult and remote Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, or will it only for anothers profit bear a part in the charges and in the dangers? The perpetuity of our Government is maintained by immutable Maxims and Inſtitutions. The free and honourable quiet of not provoking, nor being eaſily provoked, hath always been the vital Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Dominion. We have always joyned our Arms to the better ſide, and never offended any but thoſe that went about to injure us. Who ſees not but</hi> Carlo, <hi>in the greatneſs of his mind, hath the preſumption to force the nature of things decaying, and forgetting the years he reckons will be ſooner abandoned by them than his high thoughts will forſake him? Who knows not the ſuccours of the</hi> French <hi>to be uncertain, the Genius of the Nation eaſily to embrace deſigns, and then with the ſame inconſtancy abandon them, and with ſhort interims ſeek always in Peace War, and in War Peace? Experience in the preſent affairs ſhews

it: the League for ſo long a time not conſidered; tranſgreſſing ſo often in the Treaty, forgetting as it were the Princes united with them, and now the final concerts ſcarce ſetled, the Armies ready to march, either diverting them with difficult deſigns, or confounding them with new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals. The diverſion is with much wiſdom concluded to be out of</hi> Italy, <hi>to the end to keep Armies far off, becauſe Strangers have never come near this Country but to bring all ſorts of calamity into it, and to carry away the ſpoils. It is not our intereſt certainly to draw the body of the</hi> Auſtrian <hi>Forces into the very center of</hi> Italy <hi>within the ſight of our Confines. But if the deſire of glory or the itch of War incite to juſt and great enterpriſes, let the</hi> Milaneſe <hi>be the Liſts, let it carry our Enſigns againſt that State which is that that troubles us, provokes and torments us. The Conqueſt there may may be great and common; and if it be impoſſible to take</hi> Genoua <hi>ſo long as that State ſubſiſts, why is not the firſt blow given at the root?</hi> Italy <hi>will find its liberty there, the Princes their quiet; the Confederates profit and glory; and who doubts but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon yoke once ſhaken off, the</hi> Genoueſe <hi>alſo will withdraw themſelves from it for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Senate fully concurred in this opinion, declaring that they would have no hand in the buſineſs of <hi>Zuccarello,</hi> as a thing out of the deſign of the League, far from common intereſt, and contrary to the good of <hi>Italy.</hi> But to impreſs upon <hi>France</hi> the reaſons of this their diſſent, and withal divert the mind of the King, they appoint <hi>Girolamo Priuli</hi> Cavalier, Ambaſſadour Extraordinary to him, who notwithſtanding was obliged to ſtop at <hi>Turin,</hi> by reaſon of the death of <hi>Lorenzo Parula,</hi> Ambaſſadour in Ordinary with that Duke, and becauſe the Conſtable <hi>Deſdiguieres</hi> being come down into <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> with a great many men and a greater noiſe, the Court of <hi>Carlo</hi> became the ſeat of ſo weighty a buſineſs. There met then in <hi>Suſa</hi> the Duke with his Sons, and the Conſtable with the Mareſhal <hi>de Crequi</hi> his Son-in-law and the Preſident <hi>Buglion,</hi> both with Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of Ambaſſadours Extraordinary from the Crown for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occurrences, and <hi>Priuli</hi> chanced to be there. He conteſted highly, that their Arms might be imployed in any other place, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> and if they would reſolve upon an open War, gave conſent that they might be managed againſt the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>French</hi> perſiſted in the Council to make a War, without breaking Peace with <hi>Spain;</hi> and <hi>Carlo,</hi> fruſtrate of his vaſt hopes, could not be paid with any reaſon; but, moved againſt the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Republick, began to give place in his heart to thoſe diſguſts, which carried him afterwards to greater tranſgreſſions. Nevertheleſs, not willing for the preſent, the Armies being in action in the <hi>Griſons,</hi> to alienate themſelves from the Republick by an open ſeparation of their counſels from their aims, taking pretext from the Winter-ſeaſon, they make a ſhew to refer the reſolution and imployment of their Arms to another time. But in effect, the concert was ſecretly concluded betwixt the Crown and the Duke to invade the year following the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> of which the Eaſt ſide of the River remaining to <hi>Savoy,</hi> that of the Weſt accrued to <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:53750:114"/>
with the City it ſelf of <hi>Genoua.</hi> About this there paſſed ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, each deſiring, for the importance and wealth, to annex it to his Dominion; but <hi>Carlo</hi> at laſt gave way, ſuch being the greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he had of that enterpriſe, which, though the augmenting the power of <hi>France,</hi> and letting himſelf be environed in a manner on all ſides, was not his intereſt; nevertheleſs calculating always his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns above his hopes, he fancied to himſelf to remain at laſt Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Italy,</hi> out of a belief, that the <hi>French</hi> would either quickly be weary of their Conqueſts, or at leaſt would ſoon neglect to preſerve them. To remove him from ſuch thoughts, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters propounded large offers, to beſtow the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Toledo,</hi> of great Revenue, upon the Cardinal his Son, and other advantages, with ſome ſatisfaction alſo in the buſineſs of <hi>Zuccarello.</hi> But he hopes for all. <hi>Feria</hi> attentive upon the motions in the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and the deſigns of the Duke, had raiſed a gallant Army in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> and the Republick encompaſſed by ſo many Troops of that State, and by no leſs jealouſies towards <hi>Tirol</hi> and <hi>Friuli,</hi> ſtrengthened it ſelf more and more. Amongſt many military Commanders which put themſelves into their Service, the chief was <hi>Henry de la Tour,</hi> the famous ſtirrer up of the Rebellion of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> They increaſed alſo their Forces by Sea, arming in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> Gallies extraordinary; and it fitly happened, that thirteen Pinnaces of <hi>Barbary</hi> being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into the Chanel of <hi>Cattaro,</hi> with the connivence of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Commanders in <hi>Caſtel novo,</hi> aſſaulting <hi>Peraſto</hi> by night and plundering it, had given pretext to twenty three Gallies of <hi>Spain</hi> in the purſuit of them to advance to <hi>Raguſa;</hi> whereupon, to repulſe the one and the other, <hi>Anthonio Piſani</hi> Proveditor of the Fleet, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling it in all haſte came into thoſe waters. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> retiring, and the Pirates flying with the ſame celerity, theſe did ſome little hurt as they paſſed to the Iſlands of <hi>Teacchi</hi> and of <hi>Zant,</hi> withdrawing themſelves from the deſerved chaſtiſement, which with a more ſignal revenge was ſuſpended till another time. During this interim, four Frigats of the Pirates of St. <hi>Maura,</hi> falling into the hands of the ſaid Proveditor, paid the penalty of their Rapine and Piracy.</p>

The baniſhed, with the incouragement of the Regiment of <hi>Salice,</hi> one of their own Country, came down at the ſame time from ſeveral parts, and by the knowledge of the ſituations, over-powering the Poſts kept by the Souldiers of <hi>Leopold,</hi> in a very little time and with no great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt poſſeſs themſelves of the <hi>Steich,</hi> the Bridge of the <hi>Rhine, Majan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt,</hi> the <hi>Sluſe</hi> of <hi>Partentz,</hi> and <hi>Flex;</hi> excluding ſuccours out of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> It is not to be believed, how upon the ſudden, glaring forth of liberty, the people were refreſhed, who had ſcarce known what it was, till they ſaw it oppreſſed.

He endeavoured to help himſelf by art, threatning the Confederates to deliver the Forts to the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> if they ſhould attempt them by force. But they, having now their Troops in readineſs, could no longer, nor were inclined to it, remain amidſt the Rocks of <hi>Rhetia</hi> without loſing their Army by the rigour of the Winter and the want of Victuals.

Whereupon the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates become Maſters of that of <hi>Piantamala,</hi> whence without ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping they paſs on to <hi>Tirano.

Nevertheleſs he made a ſhew to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to defend himſelf more with the name and veneration of the Enſigns of the Church than with the Garriſon; but the Towns-men not truſting to ſo weak Forces, and fearing death and pillage from the fury of the Souldiers, went out through a hole in the Wall while the Governour kept the Gates ſhut, to capitulate the delivery, which was accepted upon condition, not to put a Garriſon of <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> but of <hi>French</hi> into it. <hi>Bagni</hi> being retired with his Souldiers into the Caſtle, imploring ſuccours of <hi>Feria,</hi> and demanding of <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre</hi> a ſuſpenſion of Arms for ſome days, deſired to protract time, in hope that, wanting Cannon for battery, and other proviſions, the ſeaſon and ſituation might defend him. But all conditions that might hinder their progreſs being refuſed by the Confederates, that, which the one believed impoſſible, ſucceeded eaſily to the others; for ſix Cannons arrived in the Camp, with a number of Pioneers and every thing elſe that was neceſſary, ſent by <hi>Anthonio Barbaro,</hi> General for the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who cauſed them to paſs through the Snow and over the Cliffs: for thoſe of the <hi>Valteline</hi> had on that ſide towards <hi>Auriga</hi> cut off the way; but all yielding to fatigue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, they were quickly ſeen placed by the force of mens Arms upon high and almoſt inacceſſible places, whence battering the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, they obliged it after a few ſhot to render, and <hi>Bagni</hi> to go out with conditions, granted in veneration of the <hi>Pope</hi> by the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, with all ſort of military Decorum.

            <p>The <hi>Auſtrians</hi> thereupon inveigh bitterly againſt them, calling them the Authors of this expedition and ſucceſs, whilſt without Victuals and other Proviſions, which they furniſhed in great abundance, the Army could not have entred nor ſubſiſted in the Valley. They diſcourſed publickly, that to divert that of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> the <hi>Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſhould bring the War into their Country; and in this while to vent their diſtaſte every where, the Count <hi>Cheſniler, Ferdinands</hi> Ambaſſadour, denies in <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Leonardo Moro,</hi> who with the ſame Character reſided there for the Republick, the ſame tittle with which his Predeceſſors and he himſelf had till now treated him.

            <p>The Pope made no leſs complaint, exclaiming in great wrath that his Souldiers and Colours were not reſpected; notwithſtanding that the Confederates had made appear to him their long patience, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices ſuffered, the Treaties unexecuted, the Expedients rejected; but if <hi>

The <hi>Merch</hi> runs through it, a ſmall River, but navigable; a little without the Town, loſing its name, it diſcharges it ſelf into ſeveral Chanels, where it enters into the Sea, or rather falls into the <hi>Scheld.</hi>

                  <hi>Spinola</hi> foreſaw the difficulties of attacquing it by force, and from the vigorous defence, the inceſſant Sallies, the number of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, and the reſolution of the Governour, who was <hi>Juſtinus de Naſſau,</hi> natural Brother to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> comprehended the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage he might receive. Environing therefore his Camp with a ſtrong Circumvallation of Trenches and Forts, reſolves to take it by famine, which deſtroys all defence and devours Armies. <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> had not above ten thouſand men, but with them, by changing
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53750:117"/>
Quarters, he cut off Paſſages, diſturbed the Country, and laid wait for Convoys; nor did he want reſolution and courage to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted a general relief by attacquing the Line, if the States, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them too ſtrong, and well fortified, had not diſſented not to expoſe, with a number ſo unequal, the common defence to a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous event, and almoſt certain loſs. It was then reſolved to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to the ſame Arts, which the Enemy practiſed, by endeavouring to overcome famine with famine, and, by hindering Victuals from the Camp, to reduce <hi>Spinola</hi> to the fortune of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged. But he, with the prudence of an excellent Captain, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the neceſſity, had alſo provided for it by a flying body, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Convoys to be ſo ſtrongly conducted, that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> either durſt not attacque them, or attempting it could not break them. It happened, that for the ſecuring of one, the Garriſon of the Caſtle of <hi>Antwerp</hi> was much weakned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Maurice,</hi> whom Fortune ſeldom reproached for neglecting of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, attempts to ſurpriſe it, and having choſen a dark night, with Bridges made for that purpoſe paſſes the Ditch, though very broad, and raiſing the Ladders, which at the head of them were ſo faſtened, that with Ropes they were eaſily ſet up, he was now upon the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, when one of the Ladders, falling back upon its bridge, made ſuch a noiſe, that the Sentinels heeding it, and they with ſome ſhot advertizing the Guards, the Alarm was given in the Caſtle. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> taking fright, retired, leaving ſome of their Engines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and now Force not being ſufficient, nor Art ſucceeding, the hope of preſerving the place was reduced to ſuccours, which with great earneſtneſs the States ſollicited from the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which laſt, beſides the money promiſed in their Treaty, would not meddle further in that cauſe, having obtained their purpoſe to keep a great part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Power ingaged in that Country. It maintained over and above the War in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor were unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes wanting within the Kingdom, whilſt <hi>Soubize,</hi> either foreſeeing from far the Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> or moved to it by thoſe that deſired to divert the Crown from foreign occurrences, had endeavoured to poſſeſs himſelf of ſome of the Ships Royal in the Port of <hi>Blavet;</hi> and although the deſign ſucceeded not, nevertheleſs, to the Kings great reſentment, he poſſeſſed the Iſlands near to <hi>Rochel,</hi> and infeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sea with Piracy, and the Land with diſbarkings. To oppoſe and ſuppreſs <hi>Rohan,</hi> who, in <hi>Languedoc</hi> and other parts, was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Commotions, the Kings Fleet aſſembles under Command of the Duke of <hi>Monmorency,</hi> and Souldiers were ſent into ſeveral places to no ſmall diſturbance of the Wars in <hi>Italy</hi> and the neceſſities of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>England</hi> had its Forces at liberty and minds inflamed; for <hi>James,</hi> in the month of <hi>March</hi> of this year, being dead, it looked as if the ſpirit of quiet would have extinguiſhed with him, whilſt his Succeſſor <hi>Charles,</hi> as vigorous in his age as in the deſire of Glory and hatred againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was believed that with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53750:117"/>
Crown he would have aſſumed differing thoughts. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages himſelf preſently to a great arming by Sea, with which he publiſhes to attempt upon <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf, the Head and Seat of its great Power, and at the ſame time raiſes an Army to put under <hi>Mansfelts</hi> Command for the reſtoring the out-lawed <hi>Palatine</hi> into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; for which purpoſe making a League with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> he diſburſes money to him, to the end, that making War with the ſame deſign in the Empire, he ſhould not make Peace with <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> without the Kings knowledge, and the reſtoring the <hi>Palatine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Breda,</hi> that had been many months beſieged, could not expect concerts ſo remote. King <hi>Charles</hi> therefore, to preſerve it, applies means more ready, it ſerving alſo his ends to keep the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces imployed in the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> leſt, ſending them into the Empire, they might hinder the principal deſign, which was the reſtoring of <hi>Frederick.</hi> Hoping then that <hi>France</hi> would concur in the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, he reſolves, that <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> with a good number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot, ſhould paſs the Sea, and landing at <hi>Calais,</hi> ſhould firſt joyn <hi>Halverſtat</hi> with two thouſand Horſe, and afterwards altogether the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to relieve the Town. But betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> it was found, that after the Marriage, the intereſt of State, or rather the paſſion of <hi>Favourites,</hi> converted the bonds of affection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cauſes of hatred. <hi>Europe</hi> in thoſe times reckoned amidſt its unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py deſtiny, that the Government of it depended upon three young Kings yet in the flower of their age, Princes of great power, deſirous of glory, and in intereſt contrary, but in this alone by Genius agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they committed the burden of their affairs to the will of their Miniſters: for with an equal independency <hi>France</hi> was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> by <hi>Olivares,</hi> and <hi>Great Britany,</hi> by <hi>Buckingham,</hi> confounding affections with intereſt, as well publick as private. Betwixt the <hi>Cardinal</hi> and <hi>Buckingham</hi> open animoſities diſcovered themſelves, for cauſes ſo much the more unadviſed, as they were more hard to be known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buckingham</hi> being in <hi>France</hi> to carry back <hi>Charles</hi> his Bride, it ſeemed, that in the free converſations of that Court, he had taken the boldneſs to diſcover ſomething of his inclination to the <hi>Queen,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Cardinal</hi> was inflamed with the ſame paſſions, or rather feigned to be ſo, with averſion in her, who with vertue equal to the nobleneſs of blood, equally deſpiſed the vanity of the one, and abhorred the artifices of the other. Whereupon the Factions, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing amongſt the Ladies of the Court, were not ſo ſecret, but that the King was obliged to make a noiſe, and baniſh ſome: But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention betwixt the two Favourites was for power, and <hi>Richelieu,</hi> by reaſon of the favour of the King in his own Kingdom, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Authority, procured to <hi>Buckingham</hi> many mortifications and diſguſts. The other was no ſooner arrived at <hi>London</hi> with the Bride, but to make ſhew of a power not inferiour, by ill uſing her, thought to revenge himſelf. The Catholick Religion ſerved for a pretext, whilſt the Family brought out of <hi>France,</hi> according to the Contract of Marriage, practiſed it: whence diſtaſts brake forth to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53750:118"/>
ſuch a degree, that the minds of the Spouſes being alienated, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections betwixt the Crowns themſelves diſturbed, it looked, as if diſcord had been the Bride-maid at that Wedding.</p>
               <p>All this paſſed to the prejudice of the Intereſts of the <hi>Palatine</hi> and of <hi>Holland.</hi> For <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> at the inſtant that he had imbarked the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, <hi>France</hi> denying him the Port of <hi>Calais,</hi> and entry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom, was forced to land in <hi>Holland,</hi> after having nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated ſeveral days betwixt the two Kings. But the Souldiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining on board, the Ships waſted time, and almoſt themſelves, and in their paſſage weather-beaten by a great ſtorm, troubled with rains, and many inconveniences, they arrived ſo diminiſhed and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, that the ſuccours was found to be leſs than was needful, and fame had made them. Nevertheleſs at the noiſe of their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters being moved, and <hi>Spinola</hi> reſolved not to ſtir from the place now reduced to extremity, aſſembled in an inſtant, with the pomp of their great power, another Army of thirty thouſand Foot, and eight thouſand Horſe of the Trained-bands of the Country, intermixed with ſome old Souldiers drawn out of Garriſons, with which, and the ſuccours together of ſix thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe ſent thither from <hi>Tilly,</hi> they reſolved to keep the field, ſtop up the ways, hinder the relief or the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which <hi>Orange</hi> or <hi>Mansfelt</hi> might attempt. But all this was more than needed; for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Mansfelt</hi> not finding themſelves ſtrong enough to attempt any thing of moment, it was of neceſſity to give way, and let the place be taken.</p>
               <p>Another ſudden accident which retarded and diſcompoſed any further attempt by the States, was the death of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> a perſon of the higheſt Renown, who, after his Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while yet a Youth, oppoſed in the Command of thoſe Armies to <hi>Alexander Farneſe,</hi> Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> the moſt excellent Captain of <hi>Europe,</hi> became in the Arts both of offending and defence with equal valour and wiſdom the moſt famous Commander of his Age. <hi>Frederick Henry,</hi> his Brother, ſucceeds into all his Charges, a Prince, who, in his ſkill in military affairs, hath held an eminent place, and perhaps ſuperiour to his Brother, if the quality of his undertakings be conſidered, but certainly inferiour in merit; becauſe he had to do in the proſperous times of the Common-wealth, and when its Fortune was in its prime. But whatever the effect was, the change was certainly prejudicial in that Conjuncture, wherein <hi>Breda</hi> after more than nine months Siege languiſhing, and no ſuccours appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was the 9. of <hi>June</hi> rendred upon honourable conditions. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time many and various were the ſucceſſes of the War in <hi>Italy</hi> and the Negotiations of Peace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Valteline</hi> was wholly reduced by the Arms of the League, except the two Appendixes of <hi>Bormio</hi> and <hi>Chiavena,</hi> to which, in the beginning of the year, the Confederates applied themſelves. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which the Signor <hi>della Lande</hi> advances firſt, and <hi>Coevre</hi> and <hi>Valareſſo</hi> follow, poſſeſſing the Fort of <hi>Chioppina</hi> which was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and the Town it ſelf of <hi>Bormio.</hi> But <hi>Giovanni Baptiſta Canti</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:53750:118"/>
of <hi>Aſcoli,</hi> who commanded there for the Pope, being retired into the Fort, knowing that for want of water he could not make it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, renders it upon the ſight and ſome ſhot of the Cannon. There marched out three hundred and forty Souldiers, obliged by oath not to bear Arms for the ſpace of ſix months againſt the Confederates, and ſome of the <hi>Valeſians</hi> were put into Garriſon there under Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ſame <hi>della Lande,</hi> who had contributed much to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Chiavena,</hi> retiring into the Caſtle with ſome of the <hi>Popes</hi> Souldiers, abandoned the Town to the Signor <hi>de Harcourt,</hi> in hopes, by the ſharpneſs of the ſeaſon and ſituation, to hold it out for ſome time; but, contrary to their expectation, ſeeing two pieces of Cannon appear, brought over the Mountain, called <hi>Bernine,</hi> with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite labour, they alſo rendred. Together with this proſperity of Arms, went equally on the facility of the Treaty in the <hi>Griſons;</hi> for the Commonalty being called together in <hi>Coira,</hi> the Agents of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> being diſperſed or frighted, the Treaties of <hi>Lindo</hi> and of <hi>Milan</hi> were aboliſhed, and the ancient Alliances with <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Switzers</hi> reſtored to its firſt ſplendour. The Pope, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by all means to ſtop proceedings by Arms, had ſent into <hi>France Bernardino Nari</hi> Knight, that together with Monſignor <hi>Spada, Nuntio</hi> in Ordinary, they might make in that Court effectual complaints for the Invaſion of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> contrary to the reſpect due to his Colours, require the reſtitution of the Forts, and in concluſion, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it not eaſie to be obtained, open the way to a Treaty. Upon bringing to remembrance things paſt, <hi>France</hi> failed not to juſtifie the War, and withal to countermine thoſe advantages, which <hi>Spain,</hi> to captivate the Popes mind, offered to his Relations, propoſed the Marriage of <hi>Madamoiſelle de Rieux,</hi> who carried with her one of the richeſt Dowries in <hi>France,</hi> with one of his Nephews, together with all the force of that Crown; by means whereof, the Fief of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> by reaſon of the great age of that Duke, being ready to revolve to the Church, he might inveſt one of them with it, and maintain him in the poſſeſſion. By reaſon of the youth of the ſaid Nephews, the burden of the affairs lay at that time upon the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Magalotti,</hi> their very near Kinſman, to whom both Crowns di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their propoſitions and invitations, not without offers of great advantages alſo to himſelf. There was no doubt but that the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berins</hi> inclined rather to thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> and particularly to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with <hi>Stigliana,</hi> as believed more contributing to their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, whilſt for the State of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> ſo many Bulls and Cenſures of Predeceſſors lay in the way, which prohibit to alienate Fiefs devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Church, and which they apprehended, when <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> went about to uſe force, would bring upon them the envy of many, and the implacable hatred of thoſe that ſhould ſucceed into the <hi>Romiſh</hi> See. The Pope made ſome Levies, letting it be divulged, that he would raiſe to the number of ten thouſand men; four thouſand under the name of <hi>Taddeo</hi> his Nephew, and the reſt under the Command of <hi>Frederick,</hi> Duke <hi>Savelli,</hi> and one of the Princes of <hi>Paleſtrina,</hi> which was then of the Houſe <hi>Colonna.</hi> He ſent beſides ſome Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:53750:119"/>
to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> obliging thereby the <hi>Venetians</hi> to keep a ſmall body in <hi>Poleſene.</hi> By this means he was perſwaded to prunk up the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Treaty and his Mediation, for which he made choice of his own Nephew <hi>Franceſco,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Barberino,</hi> declaring him Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>à Latere,</hi> though of unripe years, yet with the aſſiſtance of nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and experienced Prelates. Neither was it ſufficient to divert him, that the buſineſs was yet crude, and the Treaty undigeſted, and the having it prognoſticated to him by many, that the ſucceſs would be unequal to the Dignity of his Nephew and his own deſires; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the paſſion, the Cardinal had, prevailed to ſhew himſelf in the moſt conſpicuous Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and imploy himſelf in affairs of ſo great importance.</p>
               <p>To prepare the way for it, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> inſinuates to the Confederates a ſuſpenſion of Arms; but they refuſed it, by experience of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices in former delays, and by the proſperity they had in the War, there remaining no more to conquer but <hi>la Riva,</hi> a Poſt believed of no conſideration, but became famous; becauſe being unadviſedly leſt for the laſt enterpriſe, it was the firſt that put a ſtop to going forward. The <hi>Adda,</hi> where it riſes making a Meer, cloſes with ſome mooriſh grounds to the entrance into the <hi>Lago de Como,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that it ſeparates from it another little one, and of very narrow circuit, which is called by the name of <hi>Chiavena.</hi> As the Valley ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates at the firſt, (and at the right ſide of the River, within the Juriſdiction of <hi>Milan,</hi> ſtands the Fort <hi>Fuentes</hi> in a ſituation ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elevated) ſo to this other, the County of <hi>Chiavena</hi> faces it ſelf with a Plain, where runs the <hi>Mera.</hi> Over againſt it extends it ſelf the Territory of <hi>Como,</hi> and Mountains with ſteep cliffs raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on all ſides. To joyn the County to the Valley, the way of the Mountains being too ſteep, a Street is continued longſt the Lake, cut out of the Rock, which is called <hi>Corbeio.</hi> This begun at the <hi>Riva,</hi> which taking name from the ſame uſe for which it ſerves, is no other but a cover upon the brink of the water, for the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Paſſengers, and ſafety of Merchandize which paſs by that place. There is upon a height ſome marks rather than the form of a ſmall Caſtle; and there are beſides betwixt the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the <hi>Riva</hi> certain Villages, as <hi>Campo</hi> and <hi>Nova,</hi> and ſome other that lie higher, which would never have been taken notice of, if in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement betwixt ſo powerful Princes, in ſuch a narrow corner, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rock had not ſerved for an attacque, and every ſpan of ground for an occaſion of War. Into this Poſt of <hi>Riva,</hi> kept by fifteen Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the Popes and a Commander, the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them with ſhews, and in a manner forcing of them, were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and into the adjacent Villages, to the number of four thouſand, with two Companies of Horſe, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Count <hi>Giovanni Serbellone;</hi> and enlarging it with many Intrenchments, kept it as a pledge of their hopes to recover what was loſt. Nor indeed could any be fitter for their purpoſe; becauſe keeping a Foot in the County of <hi>Chiavena,</hi> and being defended by force and the ſituation, it had ready aſſiſtance from behind them by
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53750:119"/>
the way of the Lake, commanded by a great number of armed Barks. The Confederates, though late, attempt ro drive the Enemy thence, and making the way of the Rock paſſable again, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had demoliſhed, aſſault and poſſeſs the Town of <hi>Vico,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above that of <hi>Campo.</hi> But here was the diſpute greater, there lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 800 Souldiers in it, who, making uſe of a certain Wall inſtead of an Intrenchment, had the Aſſaillants point blank expoſed to their Muſket-ſhot. Two thouſand five hundred Foot, with ſome Horſe, were appointed for the attacque, the Army ſtanding in Arms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a little diſtance. After the firſt <hi>Salvo,</hi> with loſs on both ſides, the Confederate-Troops advanced in ſuch ſort, that the <hi>Albanois,</hi> nimbly getting over the Wall, obliged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to abandon that defence, and alſo retire out of the place. But in their March towards <hi>Riva,</hi> meeting with a thouſand Foot which came to their relief, taking courage again, they returned altogether, and that ſo opportunely, that re-entring unawares into the place, whilſt thoſe of the Confederates, either weary or diſperſed, minded nothing leſs than the return of an Enemy, obliged them to quit it, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to flight, and could not be ſtopped by thoſe Troops left more behind them. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> nevertheleſs, not to ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſo many parts in the night, quit it, and the Confederates without further conteſt poſſeſſed and fortified it. Captain <hi>Ruinelli,</hi> ſent by night with four hundred Foot to take in <hi>Montagnuola,</hi> ſo ſituate as to command <hi>Riva,</hi> and greatly to infeſt it, found it prevented by great Guards of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and fortified with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Works. To cut off relief from <hi>Riva,</hi> without which it was judged difficult to ſtraighten it and take it, the Confederates appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to ſeveral Expedients. Shipwrights were ſent from <hi>Venice</hi> to build Barks upon the Lake it ſelf, to diſpute the poſſeſſion of it with the Enemy. It was reſolved alſo to place a Fort upon the Canal which ſeparated the two Lakes; but <hi>le Coevre</hi> made ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to execute it, finding the place to belong to <hi>Milan,</hi> within whoſe Confines he had no authority to make War. <hi>Harcourt</hi> alſo, who on the other ſide of the <hi>Mera</hi> had taken in <hi>Archetto,</hi> a Poſt upon the Lake, thought fit to leave it, becauſe <hi>Riva,</hi> being re-inforced with three thouſand <hi>Germans</hi> commanded by <hi>Papenheim,</hi> gave cauſe to apprehend for <hi>Chiavena,</hi> out of which <hi>Coevre</hi> had taken the two Regiments of <hi>Salice</hi> and <hi>Berna,</hi> to ſtrengthen the Poſts of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the <hi>Valteline. Codera,</hi> a ſmall place, but which facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Commerce with <hi>Chiavena</hi> and relief, the Confederates took with a Pettard. But the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſufficiently ſtrengthened, extended their Quarters and Trenches to <hi>Nova</hi> and <hi>Colico,</hi> threatning to enter again into the Valley, whiles the Army of the Confederates was weakned; and although three thouſand <hi>Griſons</hi> more were levying, yet that Nation thinking of nothing but enjoying their preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they were long in raiſing, and as men that were new, could not ſerve for much. The Regiment of <hi>Normandy,</hi> conſiſting of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred men, came now out of <hi>France,</hi> and the Republick ſent two thouſand Foot and two hundred Horſe into the Valley. And
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53750:120"/>
now without queſtion the power of the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> appeared, in that, beſides naval Forces and potent Armies elſewhere imployed, <hi>Feria</hi> had in the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> forty thouſand Foot and four thouſand Horſe. The Dukes of <hi>Parma, Modena,</hi> and <hi>

They nevertheleſs, though in great ſtreights and perplexity, by reaſon the burden of the War of the <hi>Valteline</hi> was greateſt upon them, and of the difficulty which they met with, <hi>France</hi> being elſewhere diſtracted, and the State environed with ſuſpicions, threatnings, and Arms, would not recede from the Union with King <hi>Lewis,</hi> although, amidſt theſe extremities and hoſtile appearances, allured by <hi>Spain</hi> by the ſending of <hi>Chriſtofero Benevento de Benavides,</hi> Ambaſſadour to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who, moved unto by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> came expreſly to that City, they were invited with full advantages and offers, if they would adhere to the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Party.</p>
               <p>Fortune had now beyond diſpute conducted the Emperour to ſuch an height of reputation and glory, that what with fear, and what with Armies quartered in moſt of the Provinces of the Empire, he kept under, or in quiet, as well thoſe that envied him as his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> only with the aſſiſtance of money, which <hi>England</hi> contributed to him, and a certain ſum which <hi>France</hi> with greater caution gave him, ſhewed his reſentment, taking upon him the Title of <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Lower Saxony,</hi> which that Circle, to the Emperours great diſpleaſure, conferred upon him. The King notwithſtanding proceeded with ſome ſort of reſpect, and firſt ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ambaſſadours to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> demanded the pardon and reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Frederick.</hi> But the Emperour, making anſwer to the buſineſs with an Army, ſent <hi>Tilly</hi> into thoſe parts to bridle him, and to give countenance, as he paſſed, to the Election of a Catholick into the Biſhoprick of <hi>Oſnabrug,</hi> which alſo ſucceeded, notwithſtanding that the diſagreement of the Chapter had given great hopes to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to obtain it. That Army advances thence to the <hi>Weſer</hi> to hinder paſſage, and prepoſſeſſes the Banks on that ſide, expecting till <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Walleſtain,</hi> under whom <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had raiſed almoſt in a moment a new Army of twenty thouſand men, ſhould come and joyn with him. But he, as he paſſed by, having beaten the Duke of <hi>Luneburg,</hi> who at certain narrow paſſages had endeavoured to ſtop him, carried his Army with great ſucceſs into the Biſhopricks of <hi>Halberſtat, Magdeburg,</hi> and <hi>Hall,</hi> heretofore poſſeſſed by the Proteſtants. In the heat of this, <hi>Tilly</hi> alſo, who had beſieged <hi>Sighen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> in vain, gave battel near <hi>Hanover</hi> to a great body of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and obtained a ſignal Victory, there remaining dead of them

upon the place the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> the Count of <hi>Altemberg,</hi> and <hi>Obentraut,</hi> who ſerved to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> for General of the Horſe. <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> elevated by ſo great proſperities, aſpired to great things, and having cauſed his eldeſt Son <hi>Ferdinand Erneſt</hi> to be proclaimed King in <hi>Hungary,</hi> reformed Religion in his Hereditary Countries without the leaſt conteſt, being become formidable to all, and in particular dreadful by reaſon of vicinity to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to whom, as an addition of apprehenſions, was joyned the Peace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Emperour by the means of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> for ten years more with the <hi>Ottoman Port;</hi> which, although at the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Gabor,</hi> the chief Miniſters made a ſhew at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> that they would not approve it, becauſe the old Treaty, concluded at a time when that Empire was involved in the Wars of <hi>Aſia,</hi> contained things prejudicial and unbecoming; nevertheleſs being accuſtomed in the weightieſt buſineſſes, cheapning gain rather than glory, to raiſe difficulties, that they may be overcome by intereſt, they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ratified it.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time, but with Fortune differing, <hi>John Baptiſta Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talbano,</hi> and a Prieſt being ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by the Vice-King of <hi>Naples,</hi> they propoſed a Truce to be concluded betwixt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> obliging themſelves to reſtrain the Piracies of the <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks</hi> in the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> promoted in great part, for the eaſing of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> with the money of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to interpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for a Peace betwixt the Port and the <hi>Perſians.</hi> But the <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mecan,</hi> who at that time had the direction of affairs, knowing how odious ſuch a Propoſition would be to the very Subjects of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, rejected it, diſcharging thoſe that had propoſed it. The deſign by this Treaty, to make the Republick jealous, and raiſe a diffidence betwixt them and the Port, had not probably the laſt place in the <hi>Spaniards</hi> intentions. But the <hi>Turks,</hi> on the other ſide plunged into the War of <hi>Perſia,</hi> thought it not fit for them to alienate it by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable ſuſpicions. They therefore cauſed the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> to ſend a <hi>Sangiacco</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> who, under colour to communicate the Peace confirmed in <hi>Hungary,</hi> offered in token of Friendſhip twenty thouſand men, which the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi> with their Commanders at their charge would cauſe to be conducted to the Confines, where being entertained, ſhould yield their due obedience to whom the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould appoint. But even gifts themſelves being from <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> treacherous, the Republick receiving the offer as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, did not accept it, making uſe only of ſome rules, by which the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Miniſters on the Confines might give way to the levy of ſome <hi>Albaneſe.</hi> They there and in other ultramarine Provinces made numerous Levies, but the greateſt beyond the Mountains, by the facility which the paſſages of <hi>Rhetia</hi> and the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Valteline</hi> yielded. Their Army amounted to more than twenty thouſand Foot and three thouſand Horſe, all of ſtranger Nations, which for the moſt part, by ſupplying the Garriſons with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Militia, might be drawn out into the field. Therefore wearied with jealouſies, and preferring revenge before ſuſpicion, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53750:121"/>
by ſome great enterpriſe to make advantage of this defence, and put an end to their vexations and the War.</p>
               <p>Reviving then in <hi>France</hi> their inſtances and endeavours, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, that by making War in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> miſchiefs might be prevented, much to the common quiet and glory of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, conſidering, <hi>That by one ſole blow the</hi> Griſons <hi>would be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever, the</hi> Valteline <hi>ſecured,</hi> Italy <hi>delivered, the jealouſies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, moleſtations of ſo many years taken away. The honour of the King, the Decorum of the</hi> French <hi>Nation did not conſiſt in oppreſſing the image of liberty, which was yet remaining amongst the</hi> Genoueſe, <hi>but in confirming it to</hi> Italy, <hi>by abating the Rival power, and doing himſelf reaſon on a State, upon which he hath a pretence, and which more than once, by the united Forces of the Republick, hath been poſſeſſed by his generous Anceſtors. To what elſe will amount the undertaking of</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua, <hi>but to ſuperadd reproaches upon miſchiefs? whilſt the</hi> Spaniards <hi>ſecure in the</hi> Milaneſe, <hi>means will be left there to ſend Forces into the</hi> Valteline, <hi>by treading yet harder on the neck of the</hi> Genoueſe, <hi>to make the yoke more heavy to</hi> Italy, <hi>and to make their own advantage of their money, of their Souldiers and Fleets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But nothing was of force to divert the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> from what they had concerted, although diſſembling it, they attempted to ingage the <hi>Venetians</hi> alone to break with <hi>Spain;</hi> for by promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a diverſion in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> they hoped that their Forces being imployed there, they would not remain ſo ſtrong and ſo at liberty as to be forward to go to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Genoueſe.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Carlo</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters in <hi>Turin</hi> feigning to adhere to the judgment of the Republick, dealt with it to invade the <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> faithfully promiſing, that upon advice of the breach, the Duke himſelf with his, and <hi>Deſdiguieres</hi> with the Forces of the Crown, would give countenance and aſſiſtance. But diving into the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the artifice, the Senate, with an equal warineſs deluding their intentions, offers to enter into the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> ſo ſoon as the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſhould let him know, that their Armies were paſſed beyond the Borders. But whilſt the Confederates amongſt themſelves contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about opinions and cunning, the ſeaſon for the motion of Armies drawing on, the Treaty of <hi>Suſa</hi> could no longer be concealed, and at laſt <hi>Buglione</hi> in <hi>Turin</hi> communicates it to <hi>Priuli,</hi> with great hopes, that the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> being quickly ſubdued by Force and Intelligence, there would be a fit time to invade the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> with greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. The Senate refuſes again to approve the deſign, and to the end to take no part in it, no not ſo much as in appearance or name, they order the ſaid <hi>Priuli</hi> not to enter into the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> with the Duke, but to ſtay upon the Borders. In the midſt of ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult affairs <hi>Franceſco Contarini</hi> Duke, who with many and ſignal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues had ſuſtained the Principality, though but for a very ſhort time, yields to the burden of his years and cares, and <hi>Giovanni Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro,</hi> Procurator of St. <hi>Marco,</hi> ſucceeds him, arriving at the higheſt dignity of the Country without having made any ſuit for it, and conſiderable not ſo much for his riches and the ſplendour of his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53750:121"/>
Family, as for his own goodneſs, under the guidance whereof with an unchangeable conſtancy, not intermitting the exerciſes of piety in his civil cares, he had led a life amidſt vertues worthy of Heaven, and functions due to his Country. But in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> from the place of Arms, which was in <hi>Aſti,</hi> the Army in the month of <hi>March</hi> moves: it conſiſted of thirty thouſand men, the greateſt part <hi>French</hi> got to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the hopes of a rich and a moſt certain booty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſdiguieres</hi> in his decrepit age carried himſelf as became him with great vivacity of ſpirit under the ſhadow of his ancient Fame. The Duke pufft with vanity, appeared in the Army with a ſelf-conceited confidence, rejoycing to ſee himſelf once upon the way to great and ſecure Conqueſts, and with the ſuppoſed increaſe of his States, now meditated to adorn his gray hair with Kingly Titles and Crowns. Where for a little ſpace they paſſed through the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe, Deſdiguieres</hi> commands ſtrictly no hurt in any kind to be done; but in <hi>Monferrat,</hi> St. <hi>Damiano, Nizza della Paglia,</hi> and <hi>Aqui,</hi> were forced to open their gates, leaving in the laſt a ſtrong Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the guard of the Magazin of War which was fixed there.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> complained greatly, that the Army had not only taken their paſſage, but poſſeſſed that place, and feared the wonted imaginations of <hi>Carlo,</hi> and expected no leſs inſtances from the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> doubting leſt his State ſhould in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion become the place of Ingagement, or at leaſt ſerve for Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Armies of both the Crowns. But the <hi>French</hi> excuſing the neceſſity of the paſſage, and promiſing, when the expedition was at an end, to reſtore all, marched forward.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> not accuſtomed for a long time to the accidents and troubles of War, and loſing courage upon ſo potent an attacque, made ſhew of a very weak reſiſtance. The Country was open, the City had but weak Walls, and though about ſome places they rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trenches, they were nevertheleſs weak and ill guarded; their Souldiers for the moſt Peaſants, who, uſed to idleneſs, were ignorant of diſcipline, impatient of labour, and fearful in dangers. They implored aſſiſtance from the Pope and from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters; but the one applied nothing but incouragements and counſels, and the other interpoſed delays; becauſe, fearing for the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> they had a mind to obſerve the bent of the intentions and the march of the Army, and aimed to let them be ſtreightned with greater ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, whilſt not having elſewhere to expect relief, they would be obliged not only to pour forth their gold to make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> move, but to ſubject themſelves to whatſoever hard condition that Crown ſhould preſcribe to them. Wherefore, dejected in ſpirit by the difficulty of Councils and the unhappineſs of ſucceſſes, they reſolve, abandoning the Country, to undertake the defence of <hi>Genoua</hi> alone, and ordered, that the Artillery, Ammunition, and Garriſons ſhould preſently be withdrawn from <hi>Scavona</hi> and other places; but ſoon after, being admoniſhed from a better light of wiſdom, particularly from the counſels of <hi>Giovanni Girolamo Doria,</hi> who ſhewed, that there could not be a worſe counſel than willingly to yield what they
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53750:122"/>
doubted they might loſe by force, countermanding the firſt Orders, they generouſly apply to their own defence, by maintaining <hi>Scavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and there reſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> now made themſelves to be felt, being gotten into the Streights of the Mountains by two ways on that ſide, where the Territory of <hi>Genoua</hi> is moſt enlarged towards <hi>Tortona. Novi</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it ſelf to <hi>Deſdiguieres,</hi> the Syndick meeting him with the keys. The Duke having taken the Caſtle of <hi>Ovada</hi> with little reſiſtance, and by the way routed five Companies of <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> which were ſent from <hi>Tortona</hi> in relief of one of thoſe Poſts, advanced to <hi>Roſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glione,</hi> which is one of thoſe paſſages, and of the two ways (the other being at <hi>Gavi)</hi> which lead to <hi>Genoua</hi> and the Sea, and found it abandoned by 2000 Foot of the Country, which left in prey to the Enemy the proviſions and money, which was to ſerve for their nouriſhment and pay. The Town of <hi>Campo</hi> yielded in like manner; whereupon the Duke, proud with the felicity of ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, ſollicited the <hi>French</hi> to haſten their march to draw near to <hi>Genoua,</hi> which as yet little better than unprovided, and greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by theſe ſiniſter accidents, ſeemed expoſed to the prey, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the benefit of the Intelligences and of ſo long a March; but the concerts, with ſome of the Citizens, were juſt at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant diſcovered by the Government, getting knowledge, that ſome had deſigned to open the Gates to the <hi>French,</hi> and the Duke rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning amongſt them one of the Houſe of <hi>Marini,</hi> a Kinſman to the Ambaſſadour at <hi>Turin.</hi> Whereupon the greateſt hopes of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates being cut off, and nothing remaining but the force of Arms, they were perplexed in their deſigns and march; and on the other ſide the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> took courage, certain Gallies arriving at that time from <hi>Spain</hi> with a great deal of money, and from <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi> Souldiers to relieve them. The Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> alſo ſends thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the Command of <hi>Lodovico Guaſco</hi> four thouſand <hi>Italian</hi> Foot, for which they had diſburfed three hundred thouſand Crowns, and obtained <hi>Thomaſo Caracciolo</hi> to command the Arms of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, governed till now by Chiefs not very vigorous.</p>
               <p>Upon ſuch re-inforcements there increaſed in the minds of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noueſe</hi> cares alſo equal to their ſecurity, for fear, leſt having repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Enemies, and they gone further off, they ſhould at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſubject to their Auxiliaries. They therefore lodged the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers, either in the places moſt expoſed to be attacqued, or the outmoſt parts of the City, not without complaint of the Count of <hi>Caſtioneda,</hi> who reſided in <hi>Genoua</hi> Ambaſſadour for the Catholick King, and reproached to the Council the unſeaſonableneſs of Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies in the midſt of ſo many dangers: But new and unhappy events ſoon brought things to extremity. The Duke having taken <hi>Saſſuolo,</hi> not far from <hi>Savona,</hi> directed his march to joyn <hi>Deſdiguieres,</hi> when he found the ſtrength of the Enemies Forces aſſembled in <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taggio,</hi> which conſiſted of five or ſix thouſand Foot, commanded by conſiderable Chiefs, as <hi>Caracciolo, Guaſco, Cataneo, Batteville,</hi> with ſome of the Nobleſs of <hi>Genoua,</hi> and many others joyned together in
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53750:122"/>
that great place, in deſign to keep <hi>Gavi</hi> from the attempts of the Confederates. But going forth in a good number to keep the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards</hi> at a diſtance with Skirmiſhes, it ſo fell out, that they purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and the Duke arriving thereupon in perſon, they were defeated, and <hi>Caracciolo</hi> in the flight being taken Priſoner, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours mingling with them, became Maſters of the Trenches and the place. The others retreated into the Caſtle; but unprovided of Ammunition and all manner of defence, abounding in nothing but number, were forced to render themſelves, all the Chiefs, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and Arms falling into the Dukes hands, with a very rich ſpoil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo</hi> going out upon the Mountains, and having from thence in his view the Proſpect of the River, the deliciouſneſs of the ſituation, and the Wealth of the City, ſtirred up in him that avarice which had provoked him to the undertaking. Although this blow had greatly troubled mens minds in <hi>Genoua,</hi> yet there was not the leaſt wavering there; whereupon the Duke was forced to retire, and, in conjunction with the <hi>French,</hi> apply himſelf unwillingly to the taking in of <hi>Gavi.</hi> He had counſelled <hi>Deſdiguieres,</hi> that, letting that Rock lye, which being unmoveable could not diſturb their progreſs, he would, during the warmth of the Victory, bring his Army directly to the Gates of <hi>Genoua.</hi> But the Conſtable not conſenting, was firm in the opinion, not to leave a place behind him, which having in it no ſmall Garriſon, might in thoſe ſtreights of Mountains ſtop up the ways for Victuals. The Duke had no remedy but to give way, though that reſolution highly increaſed that diſcontent, which was already ſecretly creeping upon him; obſerving that <hi>Deſdiguieres</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the places taken Garriſons of the <hi>French</hi> Nation only; arguing clearly from thence, that arrogating to himſelf the direction of the War, he aſſumed, with the diſpoſing of the Conqueſts, the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement of the Peace alſo. Nevertheleſs he refuſed all Propoſitions and advantages, which, to disjoyn him from <hi>France,</hi> came under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, largely offered to him by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and refuſes the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of Arms, which Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> Legate, touching at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi> in his way to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> cauſed Monſignor <hi>Giovanni Baptiſta Panfilio</hi> to propoſe to him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genoueſe</hi> doubtful concerning <hi>Gavi,</hi> whether it were not beſt to reſiſt with the hazard of the Garriſon in maintaining that Poſt, had referred the reſolution to the Governour of <hi>Milan;</hi> becauſe not being able to receive ſuccours but from thence alone, it depended upon him to quit or keep it. He was not willing as yet openly to ingage himſelf with the Army, and therefore commands Captain <hi>Meazzi,</hi> who was Governour, that for preſervation of the Garriſon, conſiſting of about three thouſand men, he ſhould endeavour warily to withdraw himſelf by night. But <hi>Meazza</hi> being gone out, and finding the paſſages towards the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> beſet by the Enemy, and in the confuſion of the darkneſs not knowing whither to go, returns again into the place, and the day following renders it, contrary to the intentions, ſignified to his Maſters to have held it out longer.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53750:123"/>
The Caſtle ſuddenly run the ſame hazard, the Conſtable having, as was publickly given out, found a more eaſie way to batter it with gold, than bringing the Cannon before it would have been; for being ſituated upon a Rock, it was out of all battery and attaque. The expedition of the enterpriſe would have ſatisfied the Dukes impatient deſires, if <hi>Deſdiguieres</hi> had been willing to ſecond them by going forward; but amidſt theſe Rocks, ſeeming that he had his courage in a manner petrified, he laid his excuſe upon the want of Victuals and the diſbanding of his men. The Duke from earneſt preſſing of him paſſes into fury, and from fury into ſuſpicions and accuſations, laying to his charge, that he had been caught by <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noueſe</hi> money; becauſe the glory of ſo great a man being notoriouſly defiled with avarice, there was cauſe to doubt, that by intereſt no leſs than age his warlike ſpirits had been blunted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> to foment ſuch an opinion, failed not, ſometimes by publick diſpatches to <hi>Deſdiguieres,</hi> then by ſecret Propoſitions to the other Miniſters, and ſometimes alſo by advertiſements, though falſe, to the Duke himſelf, to nouriſh diſtruſts and his diſagreements with the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters. Nevertheleſs they found themſelves greatly perplexed within; for to move <hi>Feria</hi> in ſo fair an opportunity, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther invitations, intreaties, nor the diſburſement of pay prevailed any thing; whereupon they go on to proteſts, declaring, that if he abandoned them, they would ſubmit themſelves to the protection of <hi>France.</hi> Nor failed they, to the end to give credit to that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to ſend certain Propoſitions to <hi>Deſdiguieres,</hi> which it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved had a great power to retard and reſtrain him. But in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi> the name of the Duke was ſo abhorred by all ſorts of people, that every other calamity was thought leſs, than to fall under his Government. On the other ſide, mens minds not being accuſtomed to the War, many being diſtracted by their private affections and conſiderations, others afflicted from the deſolation, which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try together with their goods and fortunes ſuffered, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and offers of both the Crowns made them wavering; and whilſt againſt <hi>France</hi> was objected the freſh hatred of ſo many evils, and the intereſt of many private perſons cloſed with <hi>Spain;</hi> after long debates in the moſt ſecret of their counſels, the reſolution not to ſubject themſelves entirely to <hi>Spain</hi> was carried but by three Votes only. They admitted notwithſtanding <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers into their places and into <hi>Genoua</hi> it ſelf; and <hi>Feria</hi> at laſt leaving a good part of his Army towards the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Confines, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances with eight thouſand Foot and three thouſand Horſe to <hi>Aleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandria.</hi> From thence <hi>Gonſales Oliveira,</hi> with a Body of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, marches forward to <hi>Nizza de la Paglia</hi> to cut off Victuals from all parts. And now, to ſay truth, the Confederates about <hi>Gavi</hi> were brought to ſtreights, no ſuccours coming from <hi>France,</hi> and the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance hoped for from the Sea failing; for notwithſtanding that <hi>Carlo</hi> endeavoured by moſt effectual offices to perſwade the King of <hi>England</hi> to ſend his powerful Fleet into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> he could not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, the King propoſing to himſelf more plauſible and profitable

deſigns againſt <hi>Spain.</hi> That of <hi>France,</hi> though the motion of it was one of the conditions agreed on, yet could as little be diſpoſed to it, whilſt the Ships were kept in the Weſt Sea to repulſe the annoyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Soubize,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> Admiral, was in <hi>Provence</hi> with a few Ships, unproportionable to what was needful, and uncapable to undertake any thing but a booty of one hundred and eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Rials, as it was wafted from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Genoua.</hi> That cauſed more noiſe than profit; for in requital, all the effects of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and, in revenge, thoſe of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>France</hi> were ſeized.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Genoueſe</hi> pretended to make themſelves ſatisfaction by a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance more conſpicuous; three of their Gallies taking the Admiral-Ship of the <hi>Savoyards</hi> at the Iſlands of St. <hi>Honorat,</hi> poſſeſſing alſo by four or five thouſand men, they ſent thither, <hi>Oneglia,</hi> almoſt without diſpute. <hi>Carlo</hi> ill bearing the inſults of the Enemy, and the loſs of his own hopes, though the Conqueſt of <hi>Genoua</hi> proved difficult, had a mind at leaſt to attempt the poſſeſſing the Weſt part of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which in the diviſion belonged to him. Separating then his own from the <hi>French</hi> Forces, he ſends one part with <hi>Felix,</hi> his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son, to take in <hi>Savignone,</hi> a Fief of the Empire, diſtant but a few miles from <hi>Genoua;</hi> and the reſt, which conſiſted in ſix thouſand Foot and four hundred Horſe, he commits to the Prince <hi>Victorio,</hi> who with one Cariere of good Fortune made himſelf Maſter of all that tract; for having after a ſhort reſiſtance forced <hi>la Pieve,</hi> where were made Priſoners <hi>Giovanni Girolamo Doria,</hi> with ſome Officers of note; <hi>Albenga, Porto, Mauritio, Ventimiglia,</hi> and <hi>Zuccarello</hi> yielded almoſt of their own accord; <hi>Oneglia</hi> was recovered, and almoſt all that remained of that River gained. The people there wanted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goods and blood than the Souldiers greedineſs and arrogance; cruelty and avarice, as it were to ſtrives, exerciſing themſelves, ſo that the Country not fruitful, nor large, but delicious and opulent, was in a ſhort ſpace ſet on broach and ſtript. This proſperity laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little; for the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> being re-inforced, and <hi>Feria</hi> drawing near, <hi>Deſdiguieres</hi> was in a manner ſhut up in <hi>Gavi,</hi> with eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men only, which diſbanded alſo by Troops, not without the ſecret conſent and ſome ſort of licence from the Conſtable and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> who in the want they were in of Victuals, publiſhed it better to withdraw them from the calamity of hunger, though the Duke upbraided them, that they did it to convert the pay to their own uſe. It was therefore neceſſary to call back the Prince, and reſolve to retire into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> leaving in <hi>Gavi</hi> nineteen pieces of the Dukes Cannon, for want of draught to carry them away, whilſt the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Pocevera,</hi> a bold people, that dwell in a Valley near <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> entring into the Quarter where they were kept, making prey of a great many, by cutting their Ham-ſtrings, made the reſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable.</p>
               <p>The retreat out of the Country of <hi>Genoua</hi> was done with ſome appearance of military daring; for the Duke marching in the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, when he paſſed in view of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> challenged them
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53750:124"/>
to a Battel, and when the Conſtable was come up, ſome Horſe of <hi>Feria</hi> fell into the Reer, obliging the reſt to make a ſtand. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſhort Skirmiſh, with no unequal loſs, the one retired to his Camp, and the others kept on their march. The Duke, though weakned in Forces, preſſed by all means to invade the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> to the end to ingage <hi>France</hi> in an open breach, but the Conſtable would not conſent to it. Nevertheleſs, to feed his diſturbed mind, and divert him from more deſperate counſels, gives way that <hi>Chrequi</hi> with the Prince <hi>Vittorio</hi> ſhould go to attempt <hi>Savona;</hi> but they ſcarce were arrived there, but the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> put upon it by the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> and moved by their money, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for a good while been maintained by the pay of that Republick, after a ſhort conteſt made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Aqui,</hi> though well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and provided; whereupon the Magazin failing to furniſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and the door being ſhut againſt ſuccours, the Confederates were obliged to return into <hi>Piedmont.</hi> By which means it became eaſie for the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> to regain in a few days all they had loſt; for the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Croce</hi> arriving with five and twenty Gallies and five <hi>Gallions</hi> of the Squadrons of <hi>Spain,</hi> and four thouſand Foot, with their pay, raiſed in the Kings Dominions, they ſent them with the aſſiſtance of two Commiſſioners to recover the River. It ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that every thing ſtrove which ſhould yield firſt. The <hi>Savoyards</hi> in ſome places were forced with little ado; from ſome they retired, and the Inhabitants beat them out of others; few endured the ſight of the Cannon, and ſcarce any a ſhot. Some men by a ſubterranean paſſage, and the favour of the people, were happily let into <hi>Novi. Gavi</hi> was by <hi>Batteville</hi> attempted with ſix thouſand men, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the ſame Fate to which it yielded when loſt; for the Governours of the Town and Caſtle, which were Father and Son, after having baſely rendred the place, were accuſed in <hi>Provence</hi> of corruption, and the latter having his head cut off, the other, now dead, was with infamy taken out of the earth and burnt. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery left there by the Duke fell into the hands of the <hi>Genoueſe. Feria</hi> lay now incamped at <hi>Croce Bianca,</hi> threatning <hi>Aſti,</hi> whither <hi>Deſdiguieres,</hi> enfeebled with his age, and much more weakned in his Fame, Reputation, and Forces, being ſomewhat indiſpoſed, together with <hi>Buglione,</hi> was retired. But <hi>Feria</hi> marches preſently away, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it be believed, that he deſigned ſome more ſenſible blow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bowels of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> whilſt <hi>Santacroce</hi> alſo, to whom were joyned the Squadrons of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Grand Duke,</hi> took <hi>Oneglia, Marro,</hi> and all that Tract, whence he paſſed into <hi>Piedmont</hi> it ſelf, which flanked with it. Nor did <hi>Carlo</hi> now receive out of <hi>France</hi> re-inforcements neceſſary, whilſt the Troops of that Crown in <hi>Italy</hi> did not exceed two thouſand Foot, and ſix hundred Horſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Miniſters then were vehemently earneſt with the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> and the Duke uſed his effectual intreaties, that to divert the deſtruction of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> they would reſolve to invade the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe.</hi> But they aſcribing the ſiniſter events to worſe counſels, would not make them good by expoſing themſelves alone to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers

and prejudice, and the rather becauſe they ſaw ſuccours far off. <hi>Deſdiguieres</hi> ready to repaſs the Mountains, and the power and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> declined in <hi>Italy;</hi> nevertheleſs remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtant in their friendſhip, they offered the greateſt readineſs in the Spring to ſecond with their Arms the generous deſigns of the King in whatſoever the League obliged to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feria</hi> making choice of the enterpriſe on <hi>Verrua,</hi> which at firſt might have been exploited with a few Troops, ingages his moſt choice Army about it, to the great eaſe of the mind and ſollicitude of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Carlo.</hi> And indeed the ſituation being ſo deep in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſuppoſing it an enterpriſe of a few days, hoped to be able from thence to torment the Duke in his bowels with their Winter quarters. 'Tis a little place on the right ſide of the <hi>Po,</hi> ſtands on a Hillock, with a weak Caſtle on the top of it, and a weaker Town on the deſcent, at that time little leſs than not regarded and unprovided. But <hi>Feria</hi> with <hi>Gonſales di Cordua,</hi> who, come out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> aſſiſted in the government of the Army, what with preparatives and delays, which the motion of a great Army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, gave time to Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> and to <hi>Chrequi,</hi> diſ-engaged from the care of defending <hi>Aſti,</hi> not only to follow him, and flank upon him, but to ſend the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Rairan</hi> with a thouſand men to ſtrengthen thoſe three hundred which alone were in it before. It ſeemed to ſome, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Chiefs were excellently well ſkill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Orders of the War, but did not well adjuſt them to the preſent buſineſs; for to march with an Army in a body, ſecure its Quarters, and intrench it ſelf firſt before the attacque of a place, was conceived wiſe counſel againſt places of ſtrength; but for <hi>Verrua</hi> it was judged exceeding the quality of the enterpriſe, and unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by reaſon of the Winters approaching. War, to ſay truth, is like a mixture of contrary Elements, wiſdom is very often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with fortune, and, according as the occaſion requires, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and boldneſs have each its time.</p>
               <p>All gave the Duke means to provide for it better, and to be vigilant for its relief, which at firſt he in a manner reſolved to neglect. He made his place of Arms in <hi>Creſcentino,</hi> which ſtands oppoſite to it on the <hi>Po,</hi> and laying over a Bridge, fortifies himſelf upon the banks of the River. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> Force was by this means rendred vain; for ſuccours, at the Dukes pleaſure, entred into the place with flying Colours, the Guards were changed, Drums beating, Souldiers were relieved, the weak and hurt withdrawn; and if <hi>Feria</hi> battered it on the one ſide, <hi>Carlo</hi> on the other repaired it. There was notable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for many days at a <hi>Ravelline,</hi> which was at the bottom of the Town, defended from the upper part by certain Trenches and Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which aſcended in moſt parts above the ſteep of the Hill, the one giving countenance and defence to the other. There, for the conqueſt of ſo ſmall a piece of earth, the blood of many was without conſideration ſported away in infinite Factions, it being contentiouſly attacqued, and defended with moſt manifeſt proofs of valour. Deſtroyed at laſt rather than gained, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

by little and little to advance, creeping as it were upwards; but with ſlow and always diſputed progreſs, whilſt with a pace more ſwift, the ſeaſon, ſickneſs, and death bringing the Army to nothing, overcame the conſtancy of the Governour of <hi>Milan.</hi> The Duke inſulted upon it with ſo much the greater boldneſs, as by his preſſing inſtances, notwithſtanding the Winter, the Marqueſs <hi>Vignoles</hi> with about four thouſand Souldiers were coming out of <hi>France.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the beſiegers themſelves ſeemed in a manner beſieged; for the waters and the mire encompaſſed their un-inhabited Quarters, in which there was great doubt to be over-powred by the boldneſs of the Enemy, and the Chiefs of the Army were juſt in conſultation to yield the Punctilio to Fortune, when <hi>Carlo</hi> and <hi>Chrequi</hi> giving on up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame Quarters, and poſſeſſing certain Poſts, obliged <hi>Feria</hi> to riſe by night and to retreat <hi>à la ſourdine.</hi> The difficulty of the ways hindred the Duke to purſue him, and the oppoſition of the <hi>French</hi> Chiefs diverted him from going into the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi> So that <hi>Feria,</hi> with the ſmall reliques of his great Army, was able to get to <hi>Ponte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtura</hi> at the ſame time that <hi>Santacroce,</hi> having left <hi>Piedmont,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to imbark. Theſe events, in which the two Crowns had gained rather the ſatisfaction to have protected their friends, than reaped the honour of noble enterpriſes, muſt not interrupt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Actions in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> where the Army of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, being come to <hi>Riva,</hi> as to the boundary of their progreſs, had remained for ſome months idle, although by the ſuccours, they had received, they conſiſted of eight thouſand Foot and five hundred Horſe in the field, beſides Garriſons and a Body of men which was with <hi>Harcourt</hi> at <hi>Chiavena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the other Party, though inferiour in number, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Serbellione</hi> being gone, the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended thoſe Poſts to <hi>Papenhaim</hi> alone with five thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot and four hundred Horſe, had the advantage of the ſtrength of the ſituation, and the facility of relief; nor could that be hindred by four Barks, which being built in thoſe parts, were armed with Souldiers of the Republick, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being ſuperiour in number, and their Cannon from the Poſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts beating upon them, did not give them leave ſo much as to put off from the ſhore. Beſides the proceedings were much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded by the emulation betwixt <hi>Coevre</hi> and <hi>Monſieur de Vobcour,</hi> Mareſhal <hi>de Camp,</hi> grown to ſuch a height, that he, envying the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and authority of the Marqueſs, contradicted always the counſels, or diverted the executions.</p>
               <p>Thus remained the Confederates amidſt the difficulty of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe and the tediouſneſs of Conſults, to the great diſcontent of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> many imputing alſo to the Marqueſs, as it was uſual, that he was too much in love with the continuance of the command and the management of the War and Money: Reſolving at laſt to attempt <hi>Nova,</hi> which having at firſt been abandoned by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and neglected by the Confederates, was now with many Trenches joyned unto <hi>Riva;</hi> but the Chiefs of the <hi>French</hi> deferring
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53750:125"/>
the execution for a month, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had time not only to be pre-advertiſed, but to repair the ruines of <hi>Codera,</hi> and plant Batteries in flank at <hi>San Fedele</hi> and at <hi>Franceſca,</hi> keeping themſelves in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to withſtand the attacque. Nevertheleſs it was attempted, <hi>Vobcour</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> in the march having the Vanguard, the ſtranger Militia of the Republick under <hi>Melander,</hi> and the <hi>Italians</hi> commanded by Count <hi>Niccolo Gualdo,</hi> followed. <hi>Vobcour</hi> at a little River makes a ſtand, to lay over a Bridge; but <hi>Papenhaim</hi> drawing many Squadrons into Arms on the other ſide diſputes it with him, and the Skirmiſh grew ſo hot, that if night had not ſeparated, both Armies would have been ingaged in a general fight. The Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates finding the oppoſition ſtrong, and the batteries annoying, under ſhot whereof the Troops being obliged to paſs, with a loſs greater than they on the other ſide received, retired, having two hundred hurt, and almoſt as many killed, amongſt which <hi>Marc An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio Gualdo,</hi> Nephew to the Count <hi>Nicholas,</hi> was of greateſt name. It was imputed to <hi>Vobcour,</hi> firſt to have made a halt unſeaſonably, and next to have ingaged in a fight without ſtaying for the groſs; and becauſe from the delays and ill ſucceſſes pretexts and accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were never wanting betwixt him and the Marqueſs, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called to Court. In the hot months of Summer, both Armies, by the unwholeſomneſs where they lay being infected with ſickneſs, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, being daily weakned by death and run-aways; ſo that there was a ſecret ceſſation of Arms.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> notwithſtanding not at all truſting in ſuch a calm, brought into the <hi>Valteline</hi> fifteen hundred Foot, and two hundred Horſe more, there being now few others beſides their Troops there. <hi>Valareſſo,</hi> fallen ſick, they ordered <hi>Luigi Giorgio</hi> to ſucceed, and to <hi>Barbaro</hi> General at Land, <hi>Franceſco Erizzo</hi> Cavalier and Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. <hi>Leopold</hi> from the ſide of <hi>Tirol</hi> threatned the Valley of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentz;</hi> but levying at the common charge of the League two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the Peaſants of thoſe parts to keep the paſſages, the danger preſently vaniſhed. <hi>Papenhaim,</hi> at laſt re-inforced with men, and not at all leſs by the ſlow proceedings of the Confederates, paſſed over the Mountain with three thouſand Foot, and his Horſe at the ſame time by way of the Lake diſbarking in the mouth of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, enters into the little Campagnia called the <hi>Back. Melander</hi> with Souldiers of the Republick, had the guard of it; but finding himſelf not ſtrong enough, and having required and not received ſuccours from <hi>Coevre,</hi> who uncertain whither the Enemies march would tend, would not ſeparate his Forces, he retires in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, firſt burning the Ammunition, leaving notwithſtanding ſeven little Pieces and four empty Barks in the power of the <hi>Germans. Giorgio,</hi> to a Redoubt which guarded the high-way, and had been gallantly, at the firſt aſſault, defended by the <hi>Albanian</hi> Foot, would have ſent ſuccours, but <hi>Coevre</hi> thought it not fit that the Army ſhould be ingaged for ſo ſmall a matter; but rather retired to the Bridge of <hi>Ganda,</hi> abandoning the Country and ſeveral places upon the Mountain, together with the Towns of <hi>Trahona, Cepſono, San Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni,</hi> and others even to <hi>Morbegno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:53750:126"/>The <hi>Germans</hi> entred into all; but the <hi>Venetians</hi> not well ſuffering the indignity of this ſucceſs, and apprehending the danger of all the reſt, ſent into the <hi>Valteline</hi> with all ſpeed the Duke of <hi>Candales,</hi> (Son of the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> lately come into the Service of the Republick) with his Regiment of <hi>French,</hi> and an hundred Horſe, at the arrival whereof <hi>Giorgio</hi> taking courage, and after many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, drawing the Marqueſs to his opinion, they drew out into the Plain, and having ſent <hi>Melander</hi> by the way of the Mountain, attac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued the Poſts. <hi>Papenhaim,</hi> not to let himſelf be taken in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle betwixt them, lightly ſkirmiſhing abandons them, retiring out of the Valley. The Rock of <hi>Corbeio</hi> did now divide the Confines and the Armies; and the Winter no leſs than the weakneſs of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces put a ſtop to their proceedings, though the Regiment of <hi>Fec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieres,</hi> as a ſeaſonable relief, was arrived out of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this ſeaſon, improper for the management of Arms, the Confederates apply themſelves to confirm what they had got, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing two Forts, one in the Center of the Valley at <hi>Tirano,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther near to the entrance at <hi>Trahona;</hi> the firſt garriſoned by the <hi>French,</hi> and the ſecond by the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Nor was there the leaſt doubt of the continuance of the War the year following; becauſe the Negotiation of Peace by the Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> in the Court of <hi>France</hi> was come to nothing, he, by reaſon of his Purple, his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and nearneſs to the <hi>Pope,</hi> having had an exquiſite reception, but found the buſineſs as much intricate and difficult. His offices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in complaints for the Invaſion, in demands for the conſignment of the Forts, in ſcruples of reſtoring the Valley to the <hi>Griſons,</hi> in propoſitions to withdraw it from their Dominion, as the only means to ſecure Religion and the Conſciences of the people.</p>
               <p>But the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> the Mareſhal of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and the Secretary of State <hi>Herbault,</hi> deputed by the King to confer with the Legate, inſiſted, <hi>That the Treaty of</hi> Madrid <hi>ſhould be executed,</hi> add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that</hi> Chiavena <hi>by the</hi> French, <hi>and</hi> la Riva <hi>by the</hi> Spaniards <hi>ſhould by way of reſpect, be delivered to the Pope, to be preſently demoliſhed, and afterwards the other Forts ſucceſſively, the demoliſhing of the one always preceding the delivery of another. That in this condition they ſhould afterwards be reſtored to the</hi> Griſons, <hi>with a Covenant expreſs, that the Catholick Worſhip alone ſhould be there practiſed, the Magiſtrates and Inhabitants of a contrary belief excepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Legate ſhewing himſelf not contented herewith, propoſed at leaſt a general ſuſpenſion of Arms in <hi>Italy,</hi> but was rejected by the <hi>French,</hi> the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> mainly oppoſing it; who believed, that the Confederates, intricated in the vain hopes of Peace, would imploy themſelves more ſlackly to the proviſion for War; and ſo would be of no other uſe but to confirm the <hi>Spaniards</hi> In their predominancy, to enfeeble the <hi>French,</hi> and to conſume the <hi>Italians</hi> betwixt Jealouſies and Charges. The Legate then ſeeing his longer ſtay unprofitable to the Treaty, and prejudicial to good Manners, departs without expecting the iſſue of an Aſſembly of ſome chief perſons which <hi>Richelieu</hi> called, becauſe he foreſaw that
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53750:126"/>
the aim of the Favourite being but to intereſt the moſt accredited of the Kingdom in his own judgment; their opinions, as it happened, would not be differing from his counſels.</p>
               <p>The Kingdom enjoyed now within a certain appearing quiet, ſince <hi>Soubize</hi> being driven out of the Iſland, and his Ships diſperſed, certain Articles were agreed with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> which <hi>Rochel</hi> alſo at laſt received under the caution of the King of <hi>England,</hi> that they ſhould be obſerved by <hi>France,</hi> and it looked as if the King were now to imploy himſelf more powerfully to the Affairs of the <hi>Valteline;</hi> to promote which, the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſent beſides to that Court <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon Contarini</hi> Cavalier Procurator as Ambaſſadour Extraordinary.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Pope</hi> ill digeſting, after the diſparaging his Troops, the repulſe alſo in the Treaty, declared, that in the Spring to come he would return into the Valley with ſix thouſand Foot and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe under the Command of <hi>Torquato Conti.</hi> To give ground and reputation to this undertaking, he ſollicited <hi>Leopoldus,</hi> who by devotion of the holy year was then at Rome, to invade it on his ſide. He ſends to <hi>Milan</hi> the Prior <hi>Aldobrandino,</hi> who concerted, that the Governour was to provide Victuals, furniſh neceſſaries and Cannon, and ſupply alſo a number of Souldiers which ſhould waſte in the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of War, at the charge of the King, though under the Popes own Colours.</p>
               <p>The Confederates, ſtrucken with this ſo ſudden reſolution, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves greatly moved, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> renouncing to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a profeſſed Neutrality, would make himſelf a Party in this War, in which, amidſt ſo many conſiderations, the moſt holy one of Religion ſerved henceforth but for a ſhadow. The Cardinal <hi>Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotti</hi> therefore having communicated to their Miniſters in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the noiſe of thoſe Arms tended againſt the <hi>Griſons</hi> only, they let him know, <hi>That the intereſt of that people being indiſtinct from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concern of the League, as much as the Princes venerated the ſacred name of the High Prieſt, ſo much they were reſolved not to abandon the Cauſe of their Friends, and the univerſal good of</hi> Italy.</p>
               <p>Surely whoever conſidered the appearance only and noiſe of this undertaking, divulged by the <hi>Pope,</hi> would eaſily be perſwaded, that his mind being overcome with the hopes of the Marriage of <hi>Stiglia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> with his Nephew, and the private intereſts of the Family, he had given himſelf up in prey to the will of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> and would draw ſtronger arguments from his having deſtined the Cardinal <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berine</hi> immediately upon his return to <hi>Rome</hi> Legate into <hi>Spain,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title to hold at the Sacred Font a Daughter born about that time to the King; but he ruminating in his mind upon more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſconded ends, governed himſelf by motives more ſecret: for having diſcovered the ſecret Negotiations, which paſſed betwixt the two Crowns, and knowing that the Peace betwixt them was near being concluded, to the deluding of the reſt, he had a mind by this oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of vigour and Arms to uphold to the World the reputation and opinion, which he thought prejudiced by the ſuffering of ſo great an affront.

being not to be dived into before the effects, every one believed, that by intereſſing the Name and Authority of the <hi>Pope,</hi> the War would be exaſperated. Preparations were made on all ſides, of Arms and of minds, and the <hi>French</hi> feigning to be equally preſſed, demanded by <hi>Monſieur de Baſſompiere</hi> a great Levy of <hi>Switzers,</hi> and that paſſage might be denied to thoſe of the <hi>Auſtrians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To find out ſome compoſure betwixt thoſe of the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the <hi>Griſons,</hi> which might ſerve to maintain the defence with minds united, or facilitate the Peace, <hi>Coevre</hi> and <hi>Giorgio</hi> aſſembled their Deputies in <hi>Sondrio,</hi> but without fruit, the one not reſolving to loſe their Soveraignty and the profits, and the other fancying to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that pardon was more to be ſuſpected than revenge. Seeds of greater calamities ſprung now up in all parts; for as much as that in <hi>Germany</hi> alſo the Victories of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> ſerved rather to exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate than terminate the War, whilſt his proſperity rendred his power as much burdenſom to his Neighbours as hazardous to the Empire. For this purpoſe a Meeting was held at the <hi>Hague,</hi> to which coming the Miniſters of <hi>France, England, Denmark, Sweden, Gabor,</hi> and of other Princes of the North, they made the World believe, that they aimed not ſo much at the moderation of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> as totally to ſuppreſs it. Nevertheleſs, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deſtiny attending ſuch an Aſſembly, every one amidſt the common intereſt driving his own peculiar deſigns, it was diſcovered, that the <hi>French</hi> did not intend to charge themſelves with ought elſe, but to give the <hi>Hollanders</hi> the Subſidy ſtipulated, that they would refuſe the Truce offered by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with other large Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> deſired to make a War, and demanded great ſums of money to maintain it; and the <hi>Tranſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> not regarding the Conditions lately made with the Emperour, offered to break anew, provided he might have a vigorous aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. In ſuch ſort that every one demanding conſiderable aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and none being willing to give them to another, the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeparates like one of thoſe great Engines which ſplit when they are ready for motion; taking pretext, that ſome, eſpecially the <hi>Tranſilvanian,</hi> had not ſufficient powers: whereupon the Meeting was put off to the year following, to the end that by a better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert the League might then be finiſhed.</p>
               <p>No body had ſhewed himſelf more earneſt in this buſineſs than the King of <hi>England,</hi> as both younger and more provoked; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon diſpatching his Favourite <hi>Buckingham</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Holland</hi> for his Ambaſſadours to the <hi>Hague,</hi> impatient of longer delay, he concludes with the United Provinces a Treaty of offence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence for fifteen years, by means whereof he pretended to reſtore the <hi>Palatine Frederick</hi> into his Patrimony, concerting a diverſion by Sea on the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to ſend an Army by Land at a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon charge. But of this, for want of money, which could not be raiſed without the odious calling of a Parliament, the deſign va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and of the other, Fortune fruſtrated the effect, although the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53750:128"/>
Fleet conſiſted of more than ninety Ships, a Squadron of <hi>Holland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein comprehended, ſo well furniſhed with Souldiers, and all other neceſſaries, that if in the inconſtancy of the waves, reaſon or force might have commanded any attempt whatſoever, ſeemed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſucceed. But carrying <hi>Fredericks</hi> Colours for a ſhew, ſailing longſt the Coaſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> and caſting Anchor in the Baye of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> in deſign to take that Port, and to pillage the rich Fleet, which was expected from <hi>America,</hi> they land at <hi>Puntal,</hi> to cut off ſuccours from the Town, and ſhut up certain Gallies and Gallions in the Port; which would have eaſily ſucceeded, if they had not ſpent a great deal of time to no purpoſe in fortifying themſelves. <hi>Spain,</hi> that was wont rather to provoke her Enemies afar off, than to ſee them before her face, and in her boſom, was in diſorder, and the King would have gone in perſon to oppoſe them, if <hi>Olivares</hi> had not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him, conſidering the remedy too late, and unbecoming the grandeur and gravity of that Nation. <hi>Ferdinand Giron,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in that Quarter, with a ſtupendious ſtoutneſs tranſported in a few Gallies from the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> and in ſight of the Enemy, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Souldiers, with which the Garriſon was ſtrengthened; they ſo moleſted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with Sallies, that, judging the gaining of it would be long and difficult, they re-imbarked, applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to what they could light on at Sea. Many Barks were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched from the Coaſt of <hi>Spain</hi> to meet the Fleet, to the end, that changing their courſe, and keeping aloof from the Cape of St. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> waited for them, they might put in at the <hi>Corogne.</hi> One of them falling ſeaſonably into their hands, ſaved the reſt; for taking it for granted, that the Fleet would make for this Port, they ſailed thither, whilſt in the mean time having had no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, it arrived happily at <hi>Cadiz.</hi> And now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Weather-beaten, and ſickneſs increaſing, returned into their own Country, not without mutual diſſatisfaction with the <hi>Hollander,</hi> the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting to the other the ill ſucceſs of the Expedition.</p>
               <p>But greater were the jars and jealouſies, which, after the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in <hi>Holland,</hi> increaſed more and more betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> for the one attributed to the other the loſs of <hi>Breda,</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying paſſage to <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> and upbraided him with the ruine of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the other intereſts in <hi>Germany,</hi> whilſt deſigning in his own Kingdom the deſtruction of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> he deſired the leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Proteſtants every where. Nor did <hi>France</hi> want com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints reciprocal, for the many repriſals happened at Sea, the retreat of <hi>Soubize</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> the aſſiſtances promiſed before the Peace to the <hi>Rochellois,</hi> and the caution given to that Peace, as though <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> intended to make a Party with its Subjects, beſides the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſom intreatment of the Queen and her Family, contrary to the Conditions of Marriage.</p>

               <p>In the beginning of this year, <hi>Torquato Conti</hi> with the <hi>Popes</hi> Army, being entred into the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> put mens minds greatly to a ſtand betwixt the report, which he publiſhed to invade the Valley joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Papenhaim,</hi> and the ſlowneſs of his march, as if he deſired retardments and expected accidents, which might divert him from doing of it. The <hi>Venetians</hi> with a body of their Army coaſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him longſt the Borders, reſolving, according to his motion, to advance into the <hi>Valteline</hi> and defend it. But before any underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and ingagement of Arms, arrives the news, that as to the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the <hi>Valteline, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> had betwixt themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a Peace; a report ſo ſurprizing, that it is not to be ſaid, how much it univerſally ſtruck mens minds; in regard, that though the name of Peace was very pleaſing, yet the ſecret management of it, and the almoſt ſhame with which the makers of it themſelves di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged the concluſion, and endeavoured to ſuppreſs the Articles, gave cauſe for due conſiderations. Nor was the buſineſs ſo ſecretly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried betwixt the two Kings, but that the Princes Confederate with <hi>France</hi> had a ſcent of it. But the appearances of War, the refuſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Popes mediation, and the firm aſſurances of the principal Miniſters of that Crown had made them confident of the contrary. From the time the Cardinal Legate was at the Court of <hi>France,</hi> it was diſcovered, that the Marqueſs <hi>de Mirabel,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> had inſinuated, that it belonged to the greatneſs and authority of the Crowns to convert the mediation of others to their own arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by agreeing betwixt themſelves to impoſe the Law to others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olivares</hi> afterwards in <hi>Spain</hi> dealt with <hi>Fargis,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, to the ſame purpoſe, with ſuch inſtance, that to ſound the bottom, <hi>Monſieur de Rambogliet,</hi> under pretext to congratulate the delivery of the Queen, was ſent from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Madrid.</hi> From diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe they paſſed quickly to the Treaty, and from the Treaty to the concluſion. During the Negotiation frequent Courriers ran to and fro, and as it was no eaſie matter to diſcover the preciſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, (the knowledge ſo much as of a Treaty being kept from every body but the two Favourites, and very few of their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents) ſo it was manifeſt, that ſome great matter was in Treaty, and the ſecrecy made it the more ſuſpicious. The Ambaſſadours of the Republick and of the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> who were in the Court of <hi>France</hi> to ſollicite the re-inforcement of their Armies, concealed not their Jealouſies; becauſe, beſides the obligation, to which the League did bind, not to treat or conclude a part, expedience required that they ſhould be Parties to the Treaty, who had a common inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:53750:129"/>
in the charge and hazard of the War. But ſome believing, though falſely, the loſs of reputation and faith leſs than that of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt, it was ſo far, that the chief Miniſters had communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the project or the conditions which were negotiated in <hi>Spain,</hi> that rather with conſtant aſſeverations and oaths they denied, that there was a Treaty. At laſt that ſecret being ſlippery, which though the tongue concealed the face declared, the Confederates found themſelves to be deluded, and complained bitterly of it. <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> in concluſion confeſſed the Treaty, affirming then, that ſome Propoſitions were come from <hi>Olivares,</hi> but ſo unworthy, that being ſcorned and rejected by <hi>France,</hi> they had not deſerved communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Princes their Friends: That the Ambaſſadour <hi>Fargis</hi> had ſince tranſgreſſed in ſigning certain Articles prejudicial and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the deſigns of the Confederates; but that the King was not only reſolved to diſavow them, but to recal <hi>Fargis,</hi> and ſeverely to puniſh him.</p>
               <p>All this aimed only to temper the taſte of the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyards,</hi> imbittered to extremity, to digeſt by little and little a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo diſpleaſing; for the truth was, the Articles by direction and approbation of both the Crowns had been ſealed in <hi>Barcellona,</hi> where the Catholick King was, though they appeared to have been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written ſome days before in <hi>Monzone;</hi> and therefore the Cardinal <hi>Barberins</hi> landing juſt at that time in <hi>Barcellona</hi> was believed in ſome meaſure to cover the diſ-reſpect which accrued to his own reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the dignity of the Pope, by not giving way nor place to his Mediation. The Treaty, which was called of <hi>Monzone,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many Articles, in the beginning whereof the Worſhip alone of the Catholick Religion being eſtabliſhed in the Valley and in the two Counties adjacent, it ſeemed that other Affairs were to be reſtored to the ſtate in which they were found to be in the beginning of the year 1617. with abolition of all Treaties and every other thing which had been made, or had happened ſince that time. But this came to be deſtroyed rather than reſtrained by other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for taking away all ſubſtance of Soveraignty from the <hi>Griſons,</hi> free Election of Judges and Magiſtrates was yielded to thoſe of the <hi>Valteline;</hi> the three Leagues were prohibited in a manner to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves, nay were ſo ſtraightly obliged to the confirmation, that they remained deprived alſo of this apparent right, if they ſhould but prolong or deny it. In recompence a certain yearly Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was aſſigned, which the people of the Valley were to pay the <hi>Griſons,</hi> the ſum to be limited by Deputies of both ſides, and this and every other Prerogative ſhould be forfeited, beſides the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both the Crowns by Arms, if the three Leagues ſhould not content themſelves with thus much, and ſhould in any manner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the Valley, or pretend to impoſe Garriſons there. The care over the exerciſe of Religion was committed to the Pope, who in caſe of innovation, advertiſing the two Kings of it, was to ſollicite the remedy from them; the Forts in like manner were to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into his hands, to demoliſh thoſe which had been built from
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53750:130"/>
the year 1620. forwards. It was impoſed upon the <hi>Griſons</hi> to lay down Arms, and the Crowns were preſently to ſuſpend their Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries in the difference of Duke <hi>Carlo</hi> with the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> offering themſelves to interpoſe, that both Parties might perform it, and that cauſe be made an end of. They reſerve to themſelves at laſt the interpretation, in caſe of any difficulty in the preſent Treaty, which by other private Articles was yet made worſe; for the <hi>Griſons</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Valteline</hi> not agreeing about the Penſion, or the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> not according with the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> about the buſineſs of <hi>Zuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carello,</hi> the Crowns aſſumed the deciſion to themſelves: In ſum, capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating all rather like Arbitrators than as Princes of contrary Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and different Intereſts.</p>
               <p>Many believed, that the two Kings and their chief Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſo much ſecrecy thus agreed, had their aim to divide the care, or rather the Dominion of the World, preſcribing Laws to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, and promiſing themſelves reciprocal aſſiſtances to oppreſs their Envyers and Enemies, ſubdue the Proteſtants and Hereticks, divide <hi>England,</hi> and ſhare <hi>Europe</hi> betwixt them. But others conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the intereſts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> being incompatible, what between the emulation and the power, no other effect in this Conjuncture could happen but that which is ſeen in bodies, which, poſſeſſed by two ſpirits, are ſtrangely toſſed up and down; and from thence did foretel, that the preſent friendſhip would quickly break out into greater conteſts and a more ſharp War. In effect, the Treaty was penned in terms very differing from thoſe which lodged in the heart of their Authors, ſuch a Union ſo extemporary taking its meaſures at that time only from occaſion and intereſt. The two Miniſters had no other aim but to deceive each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richelieu</hi> ſacrificed all conſiderations whatſoever to appeaſe a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtorm, which, with danger to involve the Kingdom in a Civil War, was riſing againſt his Authority. He had beſides a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſubdue <hi>Rochel,</hi> and humble the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and no leſs paſſion drove him to vent his revenge againſt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Buckingham.</hi> On the other ſide <hi>Olivares</hi> thought, that by amuſing <hi>France,</hi> either in Inteſtine diſcord, or Foreign hopes, and the deſigns of great profit, he ſhould without oppoſition arrive at the height of all advantages in <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> thinking by great attempts to legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate that Title of Great, which in the beginning of his Power he had cauſed the King to aſſume. Nevertheleſs, upon the firſt divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of a Peace ſo unexpected, men could not ſo ſoon penetrate into the deſigns of it; but in the confuſion of the cauſes and diſcourſes all ſtood amazed, and many afraid. The <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhewed themſelves greatly affected with it, and ſtood at gaze with ſo much the more wonder, becauſe that the very ſelf ſame day, but a little before the news came, <hi>Monſieur d' Aligre,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, had been in the Senate to give them aſſurance, that without the knowledge and conſent of its Confederates the Crown would not ſo much as heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Propoſitions, much leſs conclude the Treaty. Many doubts hereupon were toſſed to and fro in mens minds; but that which
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53750:130"/>
clearly appeared, was the omiſſion, not only of the conſent of the Confederates, but of their intereſt and ſecurity, which was not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo much as mentioned; the <hi>Griſons,</hi> beſides all this, remained pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, and indeed oppreſſed, contrary to that protection, which with ſo much reaſon the League had undertaken of them, and thoſe of the <hi>Valteline</hi> ſaw themſelves by the liberty they had gotten, neceſſarily bound up to <hi>Spain,</hi> which, bating the name, would certainly enjoy the diſpoſition of the Valley and the paſſages.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> raged not a little, whilſt beſides the publick Intereſts trodden under foot, he complained, that his own proper Concerns were expoſed, if not abandoned. In this grievous reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, recalling his Son from <hi>Paris,</hi> upon his old diſguſts he heaps up new complaints, bewailing himſelf, that the friendſhip and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>French</hi> had ſerved for nothing but to traverſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and greatneſs, calling to his remembrance, how before <hi>Aſti,</hi> when he had <hi>Inoioſa</hi> and his Army at an advantage, and in a manner conſumed, the Miniſters of that Crown by proteſts and threatnings had extorted his conſent to a Peace, and added over and above of a freſh date, that by <hi>Deſdiguieres</hi> and <hi>Crequi</hi> he had ſeveral times been forbidden rather than perſwaded not to invade the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> at a time when upon <hi>Feria's</hi> retreat he had hopes with great eaſe to have made great progreſs. Amidſt diſſatisfaction therefore and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain he meditated on reſentment and revenge.</p>
               <p>But at <hi>Venice</hi> the Senate ballanced with great deliberation the conjunctures and the times, and ſome heſitating to approve the Peace, <hi>Girolamo Treviſano,</hi> one of the graveſt Senators, ſpake to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: <hi>It hath ſeldom happened, that in friendſhips with the more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, the happineſs of ſucceſs is anſwerable to the hopes in the beginning. In the Treaties which unite us to</hi> France, <hi>we cannot deny but that the thought of increaſing the ſtrength of our Arms and the neceſſity to add ſecurity to our affairs did induce us to it. It is now certain, that in the preſent Treaties the Miniſters of that Crown have neglected the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Republick, ſailed in their faith and truth, forgotten their friends, violated their own honour, and that which is common to all, the League. But it is true alſo, that to us remains the glory to have oppoſed our ſelves againſt Princes the moſt powerful, to have by force and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels maintained our Neighbours, performed the parts of punctuality and of friendſhip, nay</hi> ex abundanti <hi>born almoſt alone the burden of the War. Let the blame then of the Treaties fall upon them that have nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated and concluded them. Certainly the friendſhips with the</hi> French <hi>are fatal to the Republick, and great good and great evils have our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors experienced from them. But ſhe hath always, in whatſoever For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, held her conſtancy for her Dowry, and having truth for her guide, hath been delivered with ſafety and applauſe even from ſhipwrack it ſelf. And now ſetting aſide anger and fear, it concerns us to conſider what is our part to do and to debate, whether the negligence of the</hi> French <hi>in their own advantages ſhould be preferred before the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Senate, the fatality of the times preſent, the importance of our own and the univerſal Intereſt. The</hi> French <hi>Miniſters in the Treaty
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53750:131"/>
of</hi> Monzone <hi>have omitted the naming their Confederates; but ſhall we then reject the Treaty it ſelf, and, if that do not include us, why ſhall we exclude our ſelves alſo from the affection of one of the greateſt Kings, and while we are afraid to be expoſed to the Arms of</hi> Spain, <hi>renounce wholly to the protection of the friendſhip of the</hi> French? <hi>Fortune is now become the portion of the</hi> Auſtrians; <hi>Reputation and Power are their Miniſters; Proſperity and Victory fight under their Enſigns. Moſt powerful Countries and Armies as ſtrong encompaſs us on all ſides, and though jealouſies may for a time be ſtifled, they will never be reconciled. Whither ſhall we run in our dangers? To whom ſhall we truſt our ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions? The Pope pretends to be offended; it is at leaſt true, that he is diſpleaſed with us. Amongst the Princes of</hi> Italy, Carlo <hi>excepted, (who runs the common riſque with us, but for the moſt part hath thoughts and deſigns apart) to whom can we truſt our ſelves, or our ſecurity, or the publick liberty? The friendſhip then of the</hi> French <hi>Crown is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us, though perhaps dangerous. It behoves us therefore to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble much; for all our ſafety is placed in an</hi> Equilibrium, <hi>which their power alone is able to give to</hi> Spain. <hi>Nor let the report diſturb us, which gives out, as if theſe two potent Crowns had united themſelves to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of all elſe. Heaven hath preſcribed limits to Empires, as alſo to the Elements, and if the divers and contrary qualities of theſe by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for maſtery one over the other, preſerves the order and duration of the World, it is not to be feared, that intereſts as diſcrepant being radically ingrafted in</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain, <hi>they can ever conſpire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Conſtitution of</hi> Europe. <hi>The hearts of Politicians have Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns and ſecret retiring places, into which there is no penetrating but by the wary guide of their ends and advantages: that errs not nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives; and from thence I could eaſily ingage to you, that the preſent Peace is a falſe ſhadow, which ſeems formed from a light yet more falſe, from ſome concern of a great Miniſter, which diſorders the publick ones of that Kingdom and the univerſal ones of the World. But it will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſh, while the cooperating of</hi> France <hi>for the advantages and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of</hi> Spain <hi>is a force againſt Nature, which will languiſh and quickly fall, when that ſhort violence that moves it ſhall be at an end. We ſee the Kingdom already in a confuſion, the Court divided, the favour tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering; but this tempeſt will ſoon vaniſh, it being the cuſtom of the</hi> French <hi>Climate not long to ſuffer turbulent weather, or be pleaſed with fair. To us who are accuſtomed by prudence and conſtancy to weary out adverſity it ſelf, it belongs to remain ſtedfaſt; with dexterity to oppoſe the preſent; to divert dangers; wait for better Conjunctures; and above all, not to aſſure our ſelves of our new Enemies, nor deſpair of our ancient friendſhips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By ſuch conceptions, thoſe reaſons being rooted up out of mens minds, which before had been imbued with the contrary, the Peace was approved by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> both by neceſſity and prudence. At the ſame time nevertheleſs, they perſwaded the Duke <hi>Carlo</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main firm in the Maxims of the common Intereſt, and they always fortified themſelves with greater Forces, till that, amidſt the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and obſcurity of objects, the bent of Affairs might be better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.

The <hi>French</hi> underſtood the reaſonable ſenſe of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, and withal feared to loſe by this example the imagination and hopes of new friendſhips. They diſpatched therefore in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Ambaſſage to <hi>Venice Monſieur de Chaſteauneuf,</hi> and to <hi>Turin Monſieur de Buglion,</hi> to the end, that excuſing things paſt by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of domeſtick intereſts, they ſhould give aſſurance, that <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould not be abandoned to the will of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe aſſiſtance in caſe of invaſion or attacque to both the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and to heal the preſent wounds, ſhould propoſe to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to procure for them of the <hi>Griſons</hi> the liberty of the paſſages, and entertain the Duke with the hopes of Kingly Titles and other vain advantages.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Venetians</hi> liſtned with little credit to ſuch projects; for <hi>France</hi> having with the concluſion of the Articles loſt the Authority and Keys, which he formerly had in <hi>Rhetia,</hi> it was no more in his power to ſhut or open the Paſſes to his friends. And therefore <hi>France</hi> had nothing elſe to alledge in excuſe, but the domeſtick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances which threatned to ſubvert that Kingdom. The Nation nevertheleſs in general were inraged at the indignity of the Treaty, and thoſe that deſigned the ruine of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> failed not to publiſh the reproofs, accuſing him, that betraying friends, he had ſold the glory and advantages of the Crown to Strangers, and that with the worſe conſequences; becauſe it yielding to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the largeneſs of Territories and the ſagacity of Negotiation, there was no way to even the ſcales but by friendſhips. <hi>But now,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>who will any more relye upon</hi> France, <hi>if the obſervance of Treaties ſhall not depend upon the integrity of the Princes, or the eternal Maxims of the State, but upon the venal arbitrage and fickle intereſts of ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Miniſter? Was it not enough then, to have offended the King of</hi> England, <hi>ruined</hi> Mansfelt, <hi>caſt off the Proteſtants of the Empire, loſt</hi> Breda, <hi>and with it in a manner</hi> Holland, <hi>if</hi> Italy <hi>were not abandoned, the</hi> Valteline <hi>and</hi> Rhetia <hi>oppreſſed, and the beſt and ancient Friends of</hi> France <hi>were not diſcontented? Is it to be thought, that the friendſhip of</hi> Spain <hi>is to be preferred before a baſe and unworthy Peace, a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip always full of jealouſie and trouble, and now ſo much the more to be lamented, as it by the Treaty makes ſuch breaches into reputation and intereſt, as by no length of time can be repaired by Arms? Let the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal then rejoyce in his ſecret Negotiations, ſo long as there ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main no more famous Monuments of his Authority and Name, than to have razed the two ſtrongeſt Pillars of the Kingdom, Faith and Friendſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Cardinal, deaf to reproaches and the gainſayings of all, maintained the Treaty, and ſollicited the execution of it. It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to know what were the more internal motives of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſo important an emergency, and what were the ſucceſſes that followed. <hi>France,</hi> to ſay truth, was at the point of being in a combuſtion; for diviſion was no more reſtrained to Religion and its Partiſans, but had invaded the Court it ſelf, the Cardinal having the chiefeſt part in it. There is no Nation that more hates and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53750:132"/>
Favourites than the <hi>French.</hi> In civil diſſenſions they ſerve ſome for a pretext, and others for a ſhelter. War and Peace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon their will; the Factions are either deſtroyed or promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Kings make uſe of them ſometimes for a ſhadow, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo for a help. The Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> above all others hath taught the rule to govern himſelf in ſuch manner, that making his own and the Royal Intereſt one, and incorporating the Favour with the Authority of the Soveraign, the one, though there was a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, could not be diſtinguiſhed from the other, nor could that be offended but the other was wounded.</p>
               <p>The ſterility which ſeemed to be in the Marriage of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> helped forward this boiſterous ſtorm, and there was thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together, as is uſual in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> jealouſies, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, paſſions, and loves alſo. It was expedient therefore to marry <hi>Gaſton,</hi> then Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the only Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the King, and by his Marriage the hopes of the Succeſſion and the fortune of the Kingdom being eſpouſed, the minds and eyes of the Court and Nation were turned towards him. He, as young in years, and inconſtant by nature, ſuffered his affections to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Mareſhal <hi>d'Ornano,</hi> who Governour of his Childhood, and now Director of his Youth, by complying with him in the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deſires of that laſcivious Age, had ſo much power with him, that ſometimes ſetting him againſt the Favourites, ſometimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king merchandize of his inclinations to his own advantage, with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Fortune paſſing through a Priſon, roſe afterwards to be Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of <hi>France,</hi> with conſiderable power and no leſs riches. Amongſt the Propoſitions of Marriage, the moſt ſecret counſel excluded that with ſtrangers, that the Duke might not provoke unneceſſarily mens minds to bold attempts, and unſeaſonable hopes to get and poſſeſs the Crown by the truſt and reliance upon Foreign Forces.</p>
               <p>The Queen-mother promoted that alone with the Heir of the Houſe of <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> which, to the ſplendour of the Blood Royal, added a conſiderable portion of Goods, Juriſdictions, and alſo of Soveraignty with the Principality of <hi>Dombes.</hi> The Faction of the <hi>Guiſes</hi> abbetted her in it; becauſe the Mother of this young Princeſs, by a ſecond Marriage, was paſſed into that Family, and the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> concurred in it, thinking to retribute to the Queen the gratitude of that favour, which he acknowledged from her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Protection. Others deſired to give him the Daughter of <hi>Conde;</hi> and <hi>Ornano,</hi> who was ſaid beyond meaſure enamoured on the beauty of the Princeſs, her Mother, promoted it, and moved the will and inclinations of the Duke to it. But the Web was woven with yet greater Intrigues; for many with the diſcord of the Royal Family deſired to introduce an alteration in Affairs, for as much as the favour of the King, and the authority of the Government falling upon <hi>Richelieu</hi> alone, others were unſatisfied at it, and aſpired to their own advantages by joſtling out the chief Miniſter, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conde,</hi> made wary by paſt experiences, taking himſelf off from his
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53750:132"/>
pretenſions in favour of his Daughter, which in the concurrence of ſo many intereſts he ſaw ſerved but for a ſtate or pretext, the male-contents betook themſelves to Engines more powerful, making, to oppoſe the Queen-mother, the Queen Regent through impreſſions of jealouſie believe, that the Marriage with <hi>Monpenſier</hi> ſucceeding to be fruitful, ſhe ſhould be neglected, and in caſe of Widowhood, be neceſſitated with ſhame and ſcorn to ſubject her ſelf to one of her own Vaſſals. They let it fall to her, that breaking the Treaty of Marriage with <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> ſhe ſhould promote that with her own Siſter the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> to conjoyn <hi>France</hi> to that Crown with a double obligation, and eſtabliſh for her ſelf in all events ſtronger defence and more pleaſing ſupports.</p>
               <p>To introduce ſuch thoughts into the Queens mind, the abhorren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which ſhe had of the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> prevailed much, which was fomented by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chevereufe,</hi> her Confident, who with many artifices had the power of her will, and beſides augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her party; for the Grand Prior of <hi>Vendoſm</hi> being her Gallant, was by her perſwaded to owne it, and to bring the Duke his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into it; Brothers both, though baſe born, of King <hi>Lewis.</hi> With ſuch ſupports they went on to greater deſigns, deliberating to offer to the <hi>Huguenots Gaſton</hi> for their Head, ſuborning Governours of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and places, not without whiſpering, that <hi>Gaſton</hi> himſelf, after having killed the Cardinal with his own hand, and retiring himſelf from Court with the applauſe of a great party, ſhould not only have conſtrained the King to pardon him, but diſpoſed, as he thought fit, of the Marriage, of the Government, and of the Crown. Nothing paſſed without <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s knowledge; for <hi>Monſieur de Chalais,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Wardrobe to the King, a great Confident of <hi>Chevereuſes,</hi> diſcovering of her the ſecrets of the buſineſs, reported them to the King with ſo terrible a proſpect, as if, the Conſpiracy being againſt his own Perſon, the deſign was to ſhut him up in a Convent, exalt his Brother to the Throne, and make him marry the Queen; ſo that <hi>Lewis,</hi> ſuſpicious by nature, and diſtruſtful to extremity, might have been perſwaded to believe things yet more abſurd. Nature had afforded to few the <hi>Magick,</hi> I may call it, of the tongue ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as to <hi>Richelieu;</hi> for, with a quick and nervous eloquence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with ready replies, and ſtrengthened oftentimes at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with tears, oaths, and paſſions moving affections, he overcame mens minds, and governed above all the will of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> who full of fear, referred himſelf to his wiſdom and conduct, to the end, that he might conjure down ſo many falſe appearances. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was made by the impriſonment of <hi>Ornano</hi> done at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> whither the Court was removed expreſly to avoid thoſe uproars and confuſions, which are but too eaſily raiſed at <hi>Paris.</hi> The King there talking to him of the Marriage of his Brother with <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> and he ſhewing himſelf not inclined to it, he was preſently after arreſted by the Guards, to the aſtoniſhment of all the reſt of his party, &amp; that ſo much the more as it was quickly followed by his death, aſcribed by ſome to the indiſpoſitions of his old age, and by others attributed
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53750:133"/>
to poyſon. The <hi>Cardinal</hi> ordered it ſo, that at the time of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt he was far off, to the end it might be believed, though he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected every thing, that the King had done it upon his own will; nay he deſired leave to retire himſelf, and withdraw his life from the hatred and ſnares of ſo potent enemies; but the King and his Mother were ſo far from conſenting to it, that, though he with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs inſtances covetouſly deſired the contrary, they permitted him to arm himſelf againſt thoſe, that envied him, with Guards; which ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at firſt for a defence, became quickly an apprehenſion and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie to the power it ſelf of the Soveraign. By the impriſonment and death of <hi>Ornano,</hi> the deſign of the Factionaries ſeemed in a good meaſure broken, but was not totally deſtroyed, thoſe of moſt power being far off; they of <hi>Vendoſm</hi> particularly, who having the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Britany,</hi> by their great dependencies gave great jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. The Court ſet forward that way, but moved ſlowly, to give time for the <hi>Cardinals</hi> Arts, who deluding the <hi>Grand Prior</hi> with his own very deſires and deſigns, and giving him hopes of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Sea, which he with great longing pretended, perſwades him to come to <hi>Blois,</hi> where the King was, and to bring his Brother with him; but were no ſooner arrived, but they ſaw themſelves made Priſoners. The Court then with ſo much the more haſte goes to <hi>Nantes,</hi> preventing the uproar of the Province. Others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this would not at all truſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> who aſpired to the Marriage of <hi>Monpenſier,</hi> and, to obtain it, was entred into the party of the male-contents, left the Kingdom, and made a Voyage into <hi>Italy. Chevereuſe,</hi> commanded to remain at a houſe in the Country, making an eſcape, gets into <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> and with a ſpirit, (above the cuſtom of the Sex) greedy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, paſſes afterwards to other Courts, carrying every where in her mind the fire of War againſt <hi>France,</hi> and that of the loves of great Princes in her rare beauty. <hi>Chalais</hi> alone remained unwarily taken in the net, which he had laid for others; for either truſting in the good turn he had done, more than mindful of the offence committed, thinking his ſervice not well recompenſed, conceived too vaſt hopes; or that, repenting to have ſaid too much, he would diſcover no more, was by ſentence of Judges, as guilty of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy it ſelf, beheaded in <hi>Nantes.</hi> Where at laſt the Marriage with <hi>Monpenſier</hi> was performed; for the Kings Brother, having no body near him that might ſuggeſt the contrary, married her, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately intangled in loves and the firſt pleaſures of Marriage, was careleſs of the ruine of all his Confidents.</p>
               <p>Theſe were then the confuſions of Court, amidſt which the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Monzone</hi> being concluded, if they took not wholly away the blame, they at leaſt ſerved to make ſome ſort of excuſe; but the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> not admitting of any, deſpiſing the flatteries of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> was ſo greatly offended, that ſwearing an implacable hatred and the moſt open reſentments againſt the Cardinal, by the means of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Scaglia,</hi> his moſt ſharp-ſighted Miniſter, he cloſes with the male-contents of the Kingdom, offers them all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53750:133"/>
and forces, and particularly to <hi>Gaſton</hi> aſſiſtance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, if, as he effectuall perſwaded him, he would revenge himſelf of the Cardinal.</p>
               <p>But at Court the ſeeds of diſcord being extinguiſhed, he turns his practices to the <hi>Huguenots</hi> and to <hi>England,</hi> ſending <hi>Scaglia</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> to the end that promoting a fierce War againſt <hi>France,</hi> he might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gain upon that Kingdom thoſe Conqueſts, which he complained he had been elſewhere traverſed in by thoſe Miniſters, or at leaſt moleſt and puniſh him that had dared to abandon and ſet at naught a Prince in friendſhip with him. The rupture indeed betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> advanced apace, the diſagreements betwixt the King and Queen in <hi>London</hi> continuing, notwithſtanding that the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of <hi>Baſſompiere,</hi> gone thither Ambaſſadour Extraordinary, ſetled certain Articles concerning the Queens Family, which in matters of Religion ſerved for a pretext to diſtaſts; but not reconciling the intereſts and paſſions of the two Favourites, <hi>Richelieu</hi> diſavowed him, and <hi>Buckingham</hi> as ſtudiouſly croſſed him. At the inſtigation of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who by his own anger ſharpned that of others, the Domeſticks of the Queen were ſent back to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There followed hereupon many reciprocal repriſals at Sea, and King <hi>Charles,</hi> taking the <hi>Huguenots</hi> and <hi>Rochel</hi> into his protection, complained of the inobſervancy of Treaties, and of the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Fort <hi>Lewis</hi> was to that Town. Upon theſe pretexts, <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> taking the quality of Ambaſſadour, had a mind to paſs into <hi>France</hi> to procure redreſs; but the true motive of his Journey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſcribed to loves contracted in that Court, <hi>Richelieu</hi> perſwades the King to refuſe him entrance into the Kingdom. The rage here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon of the other was inflamed to extremity, and ſwearing that ſince he was forbidden to enter in a peaceable manner into <hi>France,</hi> he would make his paſſage with an Army, he applies himſelf to an open breach. The Kings intentions being carried by <hi>Monſieur Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigue</hi> to the <hi>Huguenots</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> it was reſolved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, that the King, as Protector of the laſt Peace with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> ſhould, to repair the pretended infractions, ſend thirty thouſand men againſt <hi>France,</hi> divided into three Armies; whereof the <hi>firſt</hi> was to take in the Iſlands next to <hi>Xaintonge</hi> to ſtrengthen <hi>Rochel;</hi> the <hi>ſecond,</hi> to land in the <hi>Garonne</hi> near <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> and the <hi>third,</hi> keeping <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Britany</hi> in apprehenſion, diſtract the Forces, and, ſhutting up the entrances into the Rivers, hinder the Commerce.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was at the ſame time to invade <hi>Provence</hi> and <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> promiſing alſo to ſend five hundred Horſe to <hi>Rohan,</hi> who offered to raiſe the greateſt part of <hi>Languedoc</hi> with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> and with four thouſand Foot and a good number of Horſe to joyn with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Guyenne.</hi> And to the end the Kingdom might be invaded on all parts, <hi>Carlo</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> moved thereto by <hi>Chevereuſe</hi> and <hi>Scaglia,</hi> who went to attend him for that purpoſe, was to enter into it from his ſide with powerful Forces. The <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> and the States of <hi>Holland</hi> were alſo invited by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53750:134"/>
by <hi>Savoy,</hi> the one by the intereſts of Religion, and the other in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the Treaty of <hi>Monzone,</hi> and for fear of the Union betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> but both theſe Republicks, apprehending more than from the Treaty of <hi>Monzone,</hi> the evils from the diſcord betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> who coming to a War left every where a field open to the advantages and arbitrement of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> endevour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an effectual mediation to reconcile them.</p>
               <p>In this interim the Treaty was executing in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> though the <hi>Griſons,</hi> greatly ſtirred with prejudice, appealed, ſending an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Embaſſy into <hi>France.</hi> Nor was it to any purpoſe, that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Chaſteauneuf,</hi> to appeaſe them came from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Coira,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Helvetia:</hi> for the three Leagues, and amongſt the <hi>Switzers</hi> the Proteſtant Cantons would never give their conſent. Nevertheleſs, not regarding their complaints, it was agreed to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Forts, and withdraw the Armies.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> by reaſon of the nearneſs, were troubled that the Forts ſhould be demoliſhed, and the Pope refuſing to charge himſelf with ſuch a trouble and expence, <hi>Fargis</hi> at the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had conſented to new prejudices, capitulating that they ſhould by the Pope be delivered to thoſe of the <hi>Valteline</hi> or the <hi>Spaniards</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to demoliſh them. But that being diſapproved by <hi>France</hi> and the Republick; it was at laſt agreed in <hi>Rome,</hi> between <hi>Monſieur Bethune</hi> and the Count <hi>d'Ognate,</hi> Ambaſſadors of the Crowns, <hi>That thoſe old Forts, out of which the Enſigns of the Church had gone forth, ſhould be reſtored to</hi> Torquato Conti, <hi>who ſhould enter into them with three thouſand men; that he afterwards ſhould go out of them when the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould deliver him a Writing, that they were ſatisfied of the former depoſition: That at the ſame time the Confederates ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their Forces out of the new Forts, and they to be all at a time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed by the Peaſants ſo ſoon as Pope</hi> Urbans <hi>Colours ſhould enter into the first.</hi> Some retardments deferred the delivery until the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year to come; for <hi>Coevre</hi> had a mind before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, that the Penſion of thoſe of the <hi>Valteline</hi> to the <hi>Griſons</hi> ſhould be adjuſted. But <hi>Gonſales de Cordua</hi> (who, upon the removal of <hi>Feria,</hi> as little inclined to execute the Peace, commanded in the <hi>Milaneſe</hi>) denying that he had power concerning this, it was in <hi>France</hi> adjudged by the King with the conſent of the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain</hi> at twenty five thouſand Crowns a year. <hi>Carlo</hi> alſo, preſſed by <hi>Bouillon,</hi> had made a ſuſpenſion of Arms with the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to revenge himſelf of <hi>France,</hi> than out of complacency to it; for being entred into the deſign to invade with great hopes that Kingdom, he did not unwillingly diſ-engage himſelf on that ſide. In this manner was <hi>Italy</hi> ſet at quiet, but knew it ſelf big with new ſtorms and more fierce tempeſts. The <hi>Venetians</hi> accommodating themſelves to the time, and reforming their Militia, kept a ſtrong body of the moſt veteran and tryed ones. In this year amongſt the domeſtick Affairs, <hi>Frederico Cornaro,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted to the Cardinalat, in that order in which amongſt the other Crowns the Popes are wont to honour the Republick, there aroſe
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53750:134"/>
a doubt, whether, he being Son of the <hi>Doge</hi> the Law had place, which forbid them to receive Eccleſiaſtical Benefices; and it was declared by the Senate, that a dignity of that quality was not comprehended under the common name of Benefices. On the contrary, to <hi>Carlo Quirini,</hi> Biſhop elect of <hi>Sebenico,</hi> was denied the poſſeſſion, becauſe the Council of Ten, having received knowledge, that he had gotten it by means not lawful for Citizens of the Republick, and by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Miniſters of other Princes, baniſhed him with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt penalties, and the Church was given by the Pope to another.</p>
               <p>During the Truce, howſoever ſhort, cauſed by the Arms and evils of <hi>Italy,</hi> a new War ariſes in <hi>Germany,</hi> or rather the old was increaſed, by the practices of <hi>Christian</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> contrived with the Proteſtants. That Kingdom is not great in Territory, nor puiſſant in Forces, but conſiderable for its ſituation by Land and by Sea, and by reaſon of the ſupport, which through its nearneſs it gave to the Princes of the <hi>Lower Saxony,</hi> who, as hath been ſaid, had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen him for General of the Circle, and he, together with the charge, aſſuming high thoughts, hoped to manage the War to his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, by the forces and money of others; believing, that not only the Princes of the Empire, but Strangers alſo, emulous of the <hi>Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> would aſſiſt him, ſome from the motive of Religion, others from intereſt of State. He aims therefore to extend his Borders, and that principally by putting his Sons into the Biſhopricks, which lying betwixt the <hi>Elb</hi> and <hi>Weſer,</hi> had for ſome time been poſſeſſed by the Proteſtants. The deſigns being not yet ripe, nor the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours ready, which the King hoped for from <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Holland, Tilli,</hi> not to give him time to ſtrengthen himſelf, comes ſo cloſe up to him, that, not to give way, he was forced unſeaſonably to break. A Truce nevertheleſs for three months having, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> been concluded before, certain Propoſitions of Peace were debated; but not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the point of Religion, and what ſhould be the limits, which the Peace of the Empire, called <hi>Pax religioſa,</hi> preſcribed, the Negotiation was broken off. The Armies then coming to move, the King calling to him <hi>Halverstat</hi> and <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> together with the Princes of the <hi>Lower Saxony,</hi> who choſe rather to loſe themſelves amidſt hopes and attempts, than abandon themſelves to deſpair and fear, the Army was found to conſiſt of ſixty thouſand men. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrich Frederick,</hi> Duke of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> refuſing to joyn with the others, as partial to the Emperour, was by the King depoſed, and putting <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verstadt</hi> into his place, planted in that Country, very convenient for it by reaſon of its ſituation, the ſeat of the War. But the Army, which united, ſeemed capable to overcome all obſtacles and to march into the Empire, being divided into ſeveral parts was quickly ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where. The King ſends <hi>Halverstadt</hi> into the Catholick Biſhopricks of <hi>Oſnabrug, Heildeſheim,</hi> and <hi>Minden,</hi> which were able to furniſh victuals and money in abundance, and <hi>Mansfelt</hi> towards the <hi>Elb,</hi> to drive <hi>Wallestain</hi> out of the Country of <hi>Magdeburg,</hi> who poſſeſſed it with his Quarters, and afterwards to advance forwards

into <hi>Sileſia</hi> to incourage the male-contents and <hi>Gabor,</hi> who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered once more to break the Peace in <hi>Hungary.</hi> Himſelf takes his Quarters near the <hi>Weſer</hi> to amuſe <hi>Tilli,</hi> more feared than all the reſt. But <hi>Halverstadt,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Bavaria</hi> had ſent the Count of <hi>Anhalt</hi> with the Army of the Catholick League, was quickly recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to joyn the King, and oppoſe <hi>Tilli</hi> with more powerful Forces; but he falling ſick, ends his days, being ſcarce thirty years old, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that fruit of Glory not yet ripe, which by diſturbing the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire he had propoſed to himſelf, and alſo a great document, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain and ſhort life proves for remote and too vaſt deſigns. <hi>Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt</hi> finding that <hi>Walestain</hi> held at <hi>Deſſeau</hi> a Bridge over the <hi>Elb</hi> with ſome Fortifications, attempting it, played upon them for ſome days with his Cannon; but being maintained and defended by <hi>Aldringer</hi> with the ſuccours the Count <hi>de Slich</hi> brought him, <hi>Wallestain</hi> had time to come with the groſs, and taking away the Enemies ſight with a blind of linen-cloth, paſſes a part of his Army, and charges with ſo good ſucceſs the Troops of the Count, that the Horſe taking flight, left the Foot for the moſt part cut to pieces, with the loſs of ſix Cannons and forty Colours. But <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> more ready in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting Troops, than fortunate in preſerving them, appeared again quickly with fifteen thouſand men, the Adminiſtrator of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburg</hi> having given him ſome re-inforcement, and more covertly the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who having married one of his Siſters to <hi>Gabor,</hi> gave great jealouſie to the Imperialiſts. Joyning at laſt with <hi>John Earneſt,</hi> Duke of <hi>Weimar,</hi> his numbers being increaſed by many that were baniſhed out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> by unuſual ways and a very nimble march he enters into <hi>Sileſia,</hi> giving ſuch heart to the male-contents for Religion, that the Peaſants of the Upper <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi> though far off, riſing in great numbers beſieged <hi>Lintz,</hi> and great commotions appeared in the other Hereditary Provinces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was in great perplexity at theſe riſings in Arms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the jealouſies he had of <hi>Gabor</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Turks. Walleſtain</hi> ſending preſently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into <hi>Sileſia</hi> three thouſand Horſe under Colonel <hi>Beckman,</hi> ſtays himſelf ſome days to ſecure himſelf of <hi>Magdeburg</hi> and of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who being frighted, did not only give Contributions and Quarters, but acknowledged <hi>Bavaria</hi> for Elector, as <hi>Saxony</hi> at the perſwaſion of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> had done before him. <hi>Tilli</hi> his Victory a while after ruined at a blow and ſubdued all the Proteſtants. He had with great good-luck, though with ſhedding of blood, taken in <hi>Minden</hi> and <hi>Gottinghen,</hi> and afterwards beſieged <hi>Northeim,</hi> places near the <hi>Weſer,</hi> to rid thoſe parts of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and ingage them to an encounter. The King, to relieve the place, comes near to it, and obliges the Imperialiſts to riſe; but loſing the advantage to fight them in the retreat, and at a time, when <hi>Tilli</hi> being ſick was far off, it happened, that he not only had time to recover his health, but with various and uncertain marches deluded the King, and wearied him out. At laſt, in the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> the Armies met at <hi>Luther,</hi> a Village amidſt certain Mountains, which by its name gave forebodings of hopes to the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53750:135"/>
Proteſtants, but by the event proved unhappy to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tilli</hi> offered them battel, and the King with great reſolution refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it not. That at laſt came to paſs, which is ſeldom obſerved, that Fortune changed during the fight, and that Victory crowned them, who in the beginning ſeemed abandoned, as overcome. At the firſt Charge, it is not to be ſaid, what the force and fierceneſs of the Proteſtants was. The Guards, which conſiſted of four Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, being at one ſide made to run, they poſſeſſed the Cannon, and by that example almoſt all the reſt of the Catholicks gave way. But, as the more veteran Souldiers are not wont to take fright at the firſt ſtroke, but in confuſion and the greateſt diſorder to put themſelves again in order, many turning their faces of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, others rallied by their Officers, were brought back to the fight, and ſome meeting in their flight with impaſſable Bogs, taking courage from neceſſity, repulſed in ſuch ſort the Enemy, ſomewhat diſordered in the purſuit, that they took from them all their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The diſpute was very fierce, fighting with an unwonted ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy for ſeveral hours, man to man, their Swords in their hands, with ſuch noiſe from their Arms and cryes, that the Sky roared for a good way round about. At laſt the Cavalry of the right Wing of the Proteſtants fell foul upon their own Foot, with ſuch diſorder, as gave the Victory to the Imperialiſts, to the great ſlaughter of the conquered. The King changed Horſes thrice, and as often re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted his Troops to the Charge, kept them from running away, animated the faint-hearted, was in every place where either danger terrified, or hopes gave courage, acting with his voice and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, directive to his own, viſible to his Enemies, and of example to all. Nor did <hi>Tilli</hi> not perform the part of a great Captain, with ſo much the more applauſe, as to have got the day, after he was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs than overcome; ſo that Chance, which in Battels uſurps ſo great a ſhare, could not in this, by the Victory, upbraid the one with its favours, or by the loſs blemiſh the praiſe of the other. At the price of ſuch a days work, not only the remainder of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, who ſtraitned in <hi>Luther,</hi> rendred at diſcretion; but <hi>Northeim</hi> and all the Countries of <hi>Luneburg</hi> and <hi>Brunſwick</hi> with many other Cities and places yielded; conſequences, proſperous to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſpreading themſelves into every part of the Empire. Nor could it fall out at a time more unſeaſonable for the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> for that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> ready to break betwixt themſelves, denied him the aſſiſtance he hoped for. The States of <hi>Holland</hi> only, who apprehended <hi>Tilli</hi> his old deſign of getting into <hi>Frizland</hi> by the way of <hi>Embden,</hi> ſent him ſome ſuccours of men, being able to do it with ſo much the greater convenience, as that in this year, beſides the taking of <hi>Oldenſel,</hi> which was of no great moment, they had ſtood either attentive on the Affairs of the Empire, or only imployed themſelves to hinder the cutting off a Chanel, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> attempted in vain to unite, the <hi>Maze</hi> with the <hi>Rhine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King himſelf within a while took new vigour from ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and a thouſand Horſe, ſent him by the Adminiſtrator of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53750:136"/>
                  <hi>Hall,</hi> and from Recruits of his own Subjects; whereupon marching out of the Country of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> whither he was retired for refuge, he was able to take <hi>Hoye,</hi> though himſelf hurt there with a Muſket-ſhot, and his Son by a double ſtroke much more dangerouſly. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Quarters afterwards in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Bremen, Tilli</hi> alſo divided his throughout the <hi>Lower Saxony,</hi> for a bridle and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe refractory Provinces. But the defeat at <hi>Luther</hi> had given its counter-blow in every other part. To reduce the Upper <hi>Austria,</hi> whoſe ſtirring carried great danger with it, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had invited <hi>Bavaria</hi> to ſignalize himſelf by the recovery of that Province once more to God and the <hi>Auſtrians.</hi> But he, wont above all men in all Negotiations to joyn together two things ſo contrary as are Religion and Intereſt, offers to do it at his own charge, provided ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs for his re-imburſement, that the Country as a freſh pledge might remain in his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> doubtful, if another Country ſhould be offered him, of recovering this, and recompenſing him, was contented that he ſhould only lend him ſome Souldiers, with which joyning ſome Horſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of <hi>Papenhaim,</hi> the Peaſants were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from <hi>Lintz,</hi> and having their Quarters afterwards beaten up at <hi>Entz,</hi> were at laſt wholly ſubdued with much blood and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſlaughter. In <hi>Sileſia, Mansfelt</hi> had loſt the opportunity of going forward by a Truce interpoſed by <hi>Gabor,</hi> that he might joyn with him; ſo that the Imperialiſts had him ſhut in betwixt two Rivers: but when they thought to keep him ſo incloſed, he gets looſe from them by ſtealth, and advances into the Mountains of <hi>Hungary,</hi> where at laſt <hi>Gabors</hi> Brother joyns him with three thouſand Horſe, and a little after a great Body of <hi>Turks,</hi> with which he might have had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Enemy, by reaſon of the number of his Forces and the inclination of the people, if the fame of the Victory of <hi>Luther</hi> had not been to <hi>Walleſtain</hi> in place of a great ſupply: For <hi>Gabor</hi> applying himſelf to new projects of Peace, ſeparates from <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> and by his example the <hi>Turks</hi> retire; ſo that the Count, environed in the Mountains by the Imperialiſts, without victuals, without money, and with Troops almoſt diſbanded and conſumed, leaving order to the ſmall reliques of his Army, that they ſhould endeavour to joyn with the <hi>Tranſilvanian,</hi> ſlips away almoſt alone, and by a deſperate counſel getting into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions, propoſes new Unions and Treaties to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Miniſters, and takes his way towards <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> ſo to get to <hi>Venice,</hi> and from thence paſs to thoſe Princes which had formerly aſſiſted him. But being come to <hi>

               <p>And ſo <hi>Erneſt,</hi> Count of <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> having ſought for a glorious death amongſt ſo many famous occaſions, was ignobly ſurprized by it there where he leaſt expected, to the end it might be ſaid, that Fortune had defrauded him both in his birth and death.

               <p>The Marqueſs of <hi>Dourlach</hi> thought by his example to be able to attempt <hi>Alſatia,</hi> having raiſed ſome Troops in <hi>Baſil,</hi> by encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Proteſtant <hi>Switzers,</hi> and ſome little money with which <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> ſecretly furniſhed him, but not with an equal ſucceſs; for the greatneſs of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> ſo firmly rooted with ſo many Victories, being no more to be moved with little ſhocks, the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> no ſooner began to put himſelf in order, but an Army of <hi>Ferdinands</hi> arriving in thoſe parts ruined the deſign, intimidated the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and obliged thoſe of <hi>Baſil</hi> to diſcharge him.

                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> now feared by many, and reſpected by all, kept under the Empire with an armed hand, keeping his Armies diſperſed in the Countries of the Electors and Princes, that, where any held up his head, they were ready to ſuppreſs and chaſtiſe them. Nor ſeemed the deſign longer concealed to reduce Chriſtian Religion and the Authority of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> to an Union in <hi>Germany.</hi> The diſcourſe now was to make the Empire ſucceſſive, <hi>Waleſtain</hi> in particular not diſſembling his thoughts ſo to moderate the power of the Electors, that like Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> according to his own expreſſion, they might ſerve for ornament, but not to give jealouſie. He and <hi>Tilli</hi> diſpoſed with an abſolute Authority of all Undertakings, Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Quarters, and Contributions, but with a hand ſo ſevere and heavy, that oppreſſing the Countries of the Proteſtants, and not much reſpecting thoſe of the Catholicks, they drained them every where, by an unheard of licence of the Souldiery, of their money and blood. The people groaned and the Princes ſtormed no leſs,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53750:137"/>
having been accuſtomed to determine with a certain ſort of liberty the moſt important affairs in their <hi>Diet,</hi> and not to have Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions impoſed on them but by common conſent and an equal diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this ſad and ſervile proſpect of things ſcarce any was found that durſt ſhew his diſlike.</p>
               <p>Only the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> though overcome, did his beſt to reſiſt, and, to repreſent the neceſſities to others, and by the quality of the perſon to give weight to the buſineſs, ſends <hi>Chriſtian William</hi> of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> adminiſtrator of <hi>Magdemburg</hi> and of <hi>Halverſtadt,</hi> to ſeveral Courts imploring aſſiſtance. In <hi>France</hi> the deſigns and Arms of the Crown being turned another way, he obtained nothing. In <hi>Holland</hi> he had better fortune, thoſe Provinces being in a manner without War, in regard the <hi>Spaniards</hi> continued to apply themſelves only to the Affairs of the Empire, out of a firm belief, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants there once ſubdued, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> would not be afterwards but an <hi>Appendix</hi> to the Victory. And for this cauſe alſo <hi>Spinola,</hi> finding himſelf without imployment, was gone to <hi>Madrid,</hi> his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Glory after the taking of <hi>Breda</hi> ſeeming among the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be turned into jealouſie and envy. The <hi>Hollanders</hi> then ſending to the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> a body of men, with them were garriſoned ſome places on the <hi>Weſer;</hi> offering two thouſand more to keep the <hi>Sound,</hi> which is the Streight defended by two Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadels, where betwixt the Iſland of <hi>Zeland</hi> and the Province of <hi>Schonen</hi> Ships paſs into the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea. The King taking all things in good part, only refuſed this, out of a doubt, leſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi> once entred into that place ſo commodious and important, would afterward not eaſily be got out of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſtian</hi> went alſo to <hi>Venice,</hi> and found the Senate ſcarce out of the troubles of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> involved anew in ſuſpicions, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive upon the dangers, which by the ſucceſſion of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſeemed imminent; ſo that he obtained nothing but the diſcharge of the old Count of <hi>la Tour</hi> from the Service of the Republick, who went thence to the Service of <hi>Denmark. Bethlehem Gabor</hi> was alſo tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by the Prince himſelf; but he, after <hi>Mansfelts</hi> departure and the diſbanding of his Troops upon it, having made a new Treaty of Peace with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> could not break it, though he wanted not will for it, becauſe he had not the help and the conſent of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who terrified with the proſperity of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and intricated with diſadvantage in the War of <hi>Perſia,</hi> thought it beſt to preſerve the Peace, and, to confirm it, to ſend an Ambaſſadour to <hi>Vienna.</hi> And now the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> taking the Duke of <hi>Mechelburg</hi> into his protection, and putting himſelf anew into the field with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe and twenty four thouſand Foot, beſieged <hi>Blechede</hi> upon the <hi>Elb.</hi> But <hi>Tilli,</hi> who had for his fore-runner the fame of ſo many happy ſucceſſes, ſcorning an Encounter with the Marqueſs of <hi>Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach,</hi> who endeavoured to amuſe him, arriving for its relief at the time that the place being taken, the Caſtle, more from the valour of the Commander than the force of the Garriſon, yet held out, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges him to retire in ſo much confuſion and diſorder, that he left
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53750:137"/>
behind him his Cannon and much of his military Proviſions. The King thinking himſelf not ſecure in <hi>Butzenberg</hi> whither he retired, becauſe the <hi>Croats</hi> by beating Parties and intercepting Victuals mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted him, retires with his weakned Army deeper into the Dutchy of <hi>Mechelburg.</hi> From thence he ſollicites the <hi>Anſeatick</hi> Towns (ſo called from a certain Company anciently erected for Trade) and in particular the chiefeſt, which are <hi>Hambourg</hi> and <hi>Lubeck,</hi> to joyn themſelves to the common Intereſt, whilſt the Arms of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> facing them by Sea, and guarding it with armed Ships, they loſt their Liberty and Commerce. But the evil being ſo far advanced, with fear of worſe, hindred the remedy of the preſent danger; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Cities not only denied the King aſſiſtance, but being inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated and admoniſhed by the Imperial Generals to furniſh their Armies with Victuals, and give them paſſage, to grant them Ships, and diſcharge out of <hi>Hambourg</hi> the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> they obeyed in all ſave in the contributing of Ships.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tilli</hi> takes in <hi>Lawemburg,</hi> which gives name to a Dutchy, and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtain</hi> coming out of <hi>Sileſia,</hi> after having recovered with little op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition all that which <hi>Mansfelt</hi> formerly held there, entred into the Territories of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> with Forces ſo powerful, that he obliges anew the Elector to receive the Law, to contribute Victuals and Money, to recall his Subjects from the Kings Service, and to admit Imperial Garriſons in <hi>Francford</hi> on the <hi>Oder</hi> and other places, nay in <hi>Berlin,</hi> the City of his Reſidence. The ſame yoke did the <hi>Lower Saxony</hi> receive from <hi>Tilli,</hi> his Garriſons being brought into <hi>Wolfem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butie</hi> and other places of the greateſt ſtrength. There remained no more but to purſue the King, who leaving <hi>Dourlach</hi> in <hi>Mechelburg,</hi> was retired into his own Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walleſtain,</hi> who from henceforward ſhall be called the Duke of <hi>Fridlandt,</hi> (for <hi>Ferdinand</hi> acknowledged his notable ſervices with the recompence of that Title) coming into <hi>Mechelburg,</hi> puts the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs to retreat, and expulſing thoſe moſt ancient Dukes poſſeſſes it, exacting from <hi>Wiſmar</hi> and <hi>Roſtoch,</hi> Cities Imperial, vaſt ſums for the maintainance of the Army. The States of <hi>Denmark</hi> deſpairing now to reſiſt ſo much proſperity and ſo full a tide of the Catholick Arms, preſſed the King to conclude a Peace, though upon hard terms, and he by means of the Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> demanded it, but the two Generals impoſed upon him conditions ſo grievous, as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred not at all from ſervitude. They pretended, that laying down the Title of General of the <hi>Lower Saxony</hi> he ſhould diſband his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, reſtore all he had taken in the Empire, ſhould leave the Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks into which he had thruſt his Sons, ſhould deliver up <hi>Gluch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt</hi> upon the <hi>Elb,</hi> ſhould pay the charges and loſſes, renounce all Treaties againſt the Empire or the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> make no Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations in the <hi>Sundt,</hi> and in ſum, give caution for the obſervance of all things agreed. The King not aſſenting to ſuch conditions, ſaw <hi>Holſtein</hi> invaded by two puiſſant Armies. Where that <hi>Peninſula</hi> is narroweſt, <hi>Tilli</hi> enters with one on the left ſide, and <hi>Walleſtein</hi> with the other on the right. To the firſt <hi>Benneburg,</hi> and to the latter
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53750:138"/>
                  <hi>Steimberg</hi> were rendred without much difficulty, the King not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himſelf but by retiring deeper into the Country, and burning the Country he abandoned, the Peaſants over and above cutting the Dikes, and leaving themſelves in prey to the waters to ſave their houſes and goods from their Enemies.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Tilli,</hi> to oppoſe the <hi>Hollanders</hi> which had ſent conſiderable Forces into the Territory of <hi>Bremen,</hi> yielded the enterpriſe upon <hi>Denmark</hi> to <hi>Walleſtein,</hi> who quickly taking the places of greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, made himſelf Maſter before the end of Winter, not only of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> but of the Countries of <hi>Sleſwich, Jutland,</hi> and <hi>Ditmars,</hi> notwithſtanding the ſtrength of the ſituations and the inconvenience of the Ice and Climate. <hi>Dourlach</hi> withdrawn into a little Iſland near to the Continent, was by the Count <hi>de Slich,</hi> who had firſt defeated certain Companies, and gained eighteen pieces of Ordnance, ſo cloſely beſieged, that having no Barks to ſave his Troops, was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hardly able to get away alone in a ſmall Boat, leaving the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to ſhift for themſelves, who took Service under the Imperial Colours. The King having a Navy of ſixty Ships, guarded the Iſlands, and ſcoured the Coaſts, and although eight of them fell into the hands of the Imperialiſts, he was nevertheleſs Maſter at Sea.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Auſtrians</hi> by entring with a naval Army into the <hi>Baltick,</hi> projected a great deſign to pierce into the bowels of the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and at the ſame time to bridle <hi>Swede,</hi> ſubject the free Cities, and to ſeize upon the Trade and Commerce of the North, to the excluſion of all elſe, and in particular the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who beſides great riches draw from thence Corn to feed their people, and Wood for the Fabrick of their great Ships. All thoſe that were concerned were much alarmed, and the <hi>Anſeatick</hi> Towns were more eſpecially diſturbed at it, who taking courage from the extremity of the danger, did not only deny <hi>Ferdinand</hi> their own Ships, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the providing them elſewhere. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding talked of ſending a Squadron of their Ships to joyn with ſome gotten of the City of <hi>Dantzich</hi> with the will and conſent of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who enamoured with ſuch a pleaſing thought, in hope that the King of <hi>Swede</hi> would be obliged to retire for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his own Country, breaks the Treaty of Peace, which he had almoſt concluded with him. But the Ships of <hi>Dantzick</hi> not being ſufficient for the neceſſity, and thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> not appearing, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was rather publiſhed than performed.</p>
               <p>In this interim another Stratagem no whit leſs was put in practice by force of Arms; <hi>Ferdinand</hi> promoting, under the pretext of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Grandeur of his Houſe and Sons. Setling upon his Eldeſt the Hereditary Crowns and the Succeſſion of the Patrimonial Lands, he provided <hi>Leopold William</hi> the Second with Eccleſiaſtical Benefices of a large Dominion; for the Archduke <hi>Leopold</hi> of <hi>Inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruck</hi> being married with <hi>Claudia de Medici,</hi> Widow of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Duke of <hi>

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53750:138"/>
Chanoines by frights or promiſes, the Emperour had got him choſen Biſhop of <hi>Halverſtat,</hi> a Principality rich in Revenue, and important for its ſituation, in the Centre of many Towns of the Proteſtants, and which enjoyed by them, and particularly by the Houſe of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xony</hi> for a long time, had for Coadjutor at that time one of the Sons of the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> The Abby alſo of <hi>Hirſchsfelt,</hi> which is a Principality of the Empire, uſurped long ago by the <hi>Landgraves</hi> of <hi>Heſſen,</hi> was conferred upon him by the Pope, and he was to recover it with Arms. The ſame was thought on for <hi>Magdeburg</hi> and <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> by which was formed for largeneſs, dignity, and riches a vaſt State in the heart of <hi>Germany,</hi> which extended the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> and which at laſt paſſing from hand to hand, would be perpetuated in their Houſe.</p>
               <p>The Princes of the Empire were ſufficiently jealous of it, and in particular the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who by ſecret Envoyes ſollicited the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> to reflect upon the oppreſſion of the liberty of <hi>Germany.</hi> Nevertheleſs he could not ſeparate himſelf from <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> becauſe the Intereſt of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> did cloſely unite him, of which, by the reconciliation with <hi>Frederick,</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians</hi> might, upon all occaſions, be able to deprive him. And juſt at this time was held an Aſſembly in <hi>Colmar,</hi> wherein, by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> ſome terms of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment were debated, <hi>Frederick</hi> being contented not to have the Country and Vote reſtored but to his Sons after the death of <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian;</hi> but not aſſenting that the Catholick Religion, introduced by <hi>Bavaria,</hi> ſhould be continued there, the Negotiation was broken off. That which made more noiſe, though it came to nothing, was a Conference of the Electors, who, moved at the univerſal oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Empire, by the exceſs of Contributions, the licentiouſneſs of the Souldiery, and the arbitrary Power of the Generals, met at <hi>Milhauſen</hi> in <hi>Thuringia,</hi> ſome in Perſon, and ſome by their Deputies, to confer of the means to preſerve Peace, and to remedy the preſent evils. The Count of <hi>Stralendorff</hi> aſſiſted there for the Emperour, whither the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Frederick</hi> being willing to ſend their Miniſters, they were not admitted. In the diverſity of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, which ſome had, and the fear, that all were in, of the Forces of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſeveral things were projected; but no one concluded. <hi>Saxony,</hi> who could not conſent to deprive himſelf of ſo great riches, oppoſed thoſe that would have the Church-lands reſtored. And he that deſired to bridle the Authority of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> was diſſwaded by the apprehenſion of his powerful Armies; whereupon he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the thoughts of ſome, and particularly of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to reſtrain by a Decree of the Diet that abſolute Power which he aſſumed in the Affairs of the Empire, ſending numerous Troops into <hi>Swevia</hi> and <hi>Francony,</hi> curbs the Catholick League and the Elector himſelf in ſuch ſort, that there was not any that had the boldneſs to expreſs or maintain his own ſenſe. Thus the Power of the Emperour runs on uncontrouled, all things ſucceeding to him with ſuch proſperity, that Fortune ſeemed eſpouſed to his deſires. But ſhe playing the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53750:139"/>
Adultereſs, at laſt made her ſelf quickly to be known, then chiefly to lye in wait to deceive when ſhe is moſt kind; for in the boſom of ſo great felicity, from the jealouſies and ſuſpicions of others was begotten the worm which corrupted it with unhappy and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous accidents.</p>
               <p>At the above-mentioned Diet of the Electors was there for the Crown of <hi>France, Monſieur de Marſcheville,</hi> who viſiting many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Germany,</hi> and penetrating into the ſecreteſt of their troubled minds and diſguſts, had exhorted ſome to patience till better times, ſtirring up others to oppoſe themſelves againſt the vaſt deſigns of the <hi>Austrians,</hi> by Treaties, if not by Arms; and beginning a Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation with the Elector of <hi>Trier,</hi> to bring him under the protection of <hi>France,</hi> had in many ſowed ſeeds of various hopes and thoughts; for <hi>Richelieu</hi> foreſeeing to what height the power of the <hi>Austrians</hi> would mount, if no reſiſtance were oppoſed, endeavoured to diſpoſe things ſo, that being at liberty from domeſtick affairs, he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf in time to foreign intereſts. For that preſent, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert greatly diverted him, wherein appeared ſo many Princes inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt that Crown, and he had diſcovered it by the Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Monſieur Montaigu</hi> as he was going into <hi>Lorrain;</hi> from whence the Managements and Treaties were not only made known to him, but he diſcovered the promiſes which the <hi>Austrians</hi> had made to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to aſſiſt them with the Forces of the Empire, together with the deſign which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had to ſurprize <hi>Tholoun,</hi> and the Intelligences which <hi>Rohan</hi> held in <hi>Mompel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier.</hi> Many of theſe deſigns with wit and prevention became fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet which alarmed all the maritime Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, could not be reſiſted but with an equal ſtrength. The Fleet it ſelf, though conſiderable for number and quality, yet arrived not at the Puiſſance deſigned in the firſt agreement, being not ſtrong enough to be divided into three parts, nor with proportionable Forces aſſault <hi>France</hi> with a triple Invaſion. For this cauſe the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> kept their motion in ſuſpence, to ſee what iſſue the firſt landing would produce.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> had diſpoſed their defence longſt the Sea-coaſt with a powerful Army under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Angouleſme;</hi> but whilſt they guarded <hi>Xaintonge</hi> and the adjacent Country from diſbarkings, the Iſlands remained expoſed. Theſe are very near to <hi>Rochel,</hi> and by conſequence conſiderable for ſituation; he that hath them being able to command the Sea, and to diſturb the oppoſite Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. <hi>Buckingham</hi> that commanded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, boaſting to make his way armed, and by force; where he had been denied a peaceable entry, choſe them opportunely for his aims, encouraged by <hi>Soubize,</hi> who accompanied him, and hoped by his credit and artifice to make <hi>Rochel</hi> and all the body of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> declare in his favour. But the Cardinal had loſt no time to ſend ſome of his Confidents into the Town, and to gain ſome of the chief, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with popular diſcourſes among the Vulgar, and at others in their Aſſemblies interpoſing difficulties in their Councils, either op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53750:139"/>
themſelves to their debates, retarded their reſolutions, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the execution of them: for in all Quarters of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> he had many that depended on him, who preferring peace and profit before the dangers accompanying their belief, by contradicting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the common Councils, or eluded their effect by the divulging of them.</p>
               <p>Thus was <hi>Rochel</hi> wavering for a time; and <hi>Buckingham</hi> in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, not to be idle, lands upon the Iſle of <hi>Ré.</hi> Some imputed to him an errour in the choice of his deſign, for that the Iſle of <hi>Oleron</hi> was leſs provided; but he choſe that which was moſt important, there being a Citadel there, which as not finiſhed, it was believed could not reſiſt, and that taken, gave him means to ſecure himſelf in that Poſt, and maintain himſelf there. And therefore perhaps he deſerved greater blame for not executing that with vigour which he had reſolved not without reaſon. At one ſide of the Iſland lay by the Sea-ſide the Citadel of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> of a narrow circuit, with four Baſtions not yet perfected, without any Out-works, ill provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within with Victuals, and with a ſmall Garriſon, the vertue only of <hi>Monſieur de Thoiras,</hi> no leſs prudent than valiant, ſupplying all other defects. At the point, which looked towards the Land, lay the little Fort of <hi>La Prée,</hi> which ſerved for no other uſe but as a door to let ſuccours into the Iſland.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buckingham</hi> lands there under the favour of the Cannon of the Fleet, which obliged <hi>Thoiras</hi> to give way to it. But neglecting the Fort, which he might have taken almoſt without diſpute, nor haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the attacque of the Citadel, he imployed many days to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie himſelf on the ſhore, though no man was there to diſturb him. He was at laſt aware that every moment was loſt which advanced not towards the place; for when he came near to St. <hi>Martin</hi>'s, he found the Garriſon had raiſed a Half-moon, the Mills intrenched, and the Fountain, which lay without the Fort, covered with ſeveral defences. He neglected beſides to take care of the Haven, believing it was ſufficient, to hinder relief, to have ordered the Ships to lye about it. He afterwards raiſed three Batteries againſt it, but weak and far off, gave ſome aſſaults, but without effect; whereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to gain that by hunger, which by force he could not do. The Garriſon, to ſay truth, was in want, and <hi>Thoiras</hi> by frequent meſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſent by Water, gave <hi>Angouleſme</hi> knowledge of his neceſſities, but in the mean time deluded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> General with feigned Treaties; for ſending frequently offers of Surrender, and ſtill cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing difficulties to ariſe in the conditions, obtained by means of thoſe meſſages knowledge of the State of the Enemy, and together with the hopes of an accord, ſlackned the force and heat of the Siege. Barks were frequently ſent by the <hi>French</hi> with ſome refreſhment, ſome whereof got ſafe in, and others fell into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the general ſuccours was much retarded, becauſe King <hi>Lewis</hi> come out of <hi>Paris</hi> to be preſent in ſo urgent a neceſſity, falling dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ſick at <hi>Villeroy,</hi> obliged not only the Cardinal to ſtay there,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53750:140"/>
but by the diſtraction of ſo unexpected an accident to retard the Proviſions. The King being at laſt recovered, and with the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal come into <hi>Xaintonge,</hi> reſolves to make a great attempt, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the care of the firſt ſtep to <hi>Monſieur de Canaples,</hi> who with ſmall Boats paſſed happily to the Fort of <hi>la Prée,</hi> and running forth certain Trenches to cover a greater number of men, made way for the Mareſhal of <hi>Schomberg</hi> to arrive with eight thouſand Souldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buckingham,</hi> ſeeing that from the Citadel and from the Fort he might be aſſaulted from two ſides, thought it fit to retire, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it with ſo great confuſion, that being attacqued by the <hi>French,</hi> he loſt a great many Men, Cannons, and Colours. Some Priſoners were ſent by King <hi>Lewis</hi> to <hi>London</hi> as a Preſent to his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, rather for a reproach than a bounty: But <hi>Buckingham</hi> being arrived home with his Ships torn and but few of his Souldiers, found the peoples hatred and the blame not leſs than had been his vanity and the expectation of the World; while the <hi>Lorrainois</hi> and <hi>Savoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> ſtood obſerving the event of things, and from the infelicity of the ſucceſs were admoniſhed to more moderate counſels. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> alone, after the landing of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> found himſelf inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> where having taken the field, he had cauſed ſome places to revolt, but being ſuppreſſed by a ſmall body of an Army, all Engines were applied to beſiege and maintain <hi>Rochel.</hi> That place at laſt at the inſtigation of <hi>Soubize</hi> and his Mother, who for that purpoſe entred into it, a Woman of a high ſpirit and of great authority, declaring it ſelf in favour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> had furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Fleet with much Victuals, depriving it ſelf by that unhappy counſel of the means to overcome hunger, the only force that could conquer it. It was boaſted to be the Metropolis of Rebellion, the old Neſt of Hereſie, the Refuge of Male-contents, and the Forge of the moſt pernicious Councils. And, to ſay truth, as being the Head of a Republick within the Kingdom, with adherence to Strangers, with divided Intereſt, and their own Force, it always diſputed or ingeloſied the Authority of the Monarch. The Kings reſpected it as impregnable, by reaſon of its ſituation, and invincible by Arms, the difficulty of the enterpriſe being authorized by the experience of ſeveral attempts in vain. On the Land ſide being environed with Salt-pits and Marſhes, lofty Baſtions and ſtrong Works were its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Towards the Ocean, the Sea being narrowed, a large Bay opens it ſelf within, which afterwards having its paſſage even to within the Walls, makes a Haven immured and ſecure from the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of Enemies, or violence of the Winds. Much Shipping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to it, for number of the Veſſels, and ſkill of the Marriners conſiderable, and in the Town, as many people, ſo many Souldiers; for every one, even the weaker Sex, being brought up in an averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to obedience, were obliged to take Arms for their own defence. If the <hi>Huguenots</hi> looked at it as the fixed reſidence of their refuge, Strangers conſidered it as the bridle of that moſt potent Kingdom. Nor were ſome of the Subjects themſelves ill pleaſed that there ſhould be ready a ſhelter to withdraw themſelves in ſome caſes out
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53750:140"/>
of the Kings power, and reſiſt the favour of the Miniſters. Sure it was, that ſome even in the Kings Council believing it impoſſible, drove on the undertaking, with hopes, in the ill ſucceſs, to ſee the power of the Cardinal who promoted it, prejudiced and perhaps ruined. But he, in the vaſtneſs of his mind, greedily imbracing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of importance, orders the place to be blocked up; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards environed with a large Circumvallation of ſtrong Trenches. But it could not be reduced by Famine, without taking away the Sea from it; and to do that, it was of neceſſity to overcome the Ocean, and find a reſiſtance to its great weight and force. <hi>Pompeo Targone,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Engineer, more famous for inventions than hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in their effects, ſpent a great deal of time in vain, wearying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there with ſeveral Experiments.</p>
               <p>At laſt the Cardinal, in imitation of the Ancients, who with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labour, ſhut up Havens, and joyned Iſlands to the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, reſolved without ſparing of charge, ſince his own glory and the Fortune of the Kingdom now tempted him to it, to lay the foundation of a defence or Dike againſt the Sea, where that Arm thereof was narrow, and ſecure from the interruption and Cannon of the Town, by flinging into it ſtones of a vaſt bigneſs, and in an infinite number. Upon theſe, from each ſide of the Continent, were advanced Walls; in the middle there remained a gap for the Tide or impetuous ebbing and flowing of thoſe waters, which from the ſides Forts and Cannon defended; without, was the Fleet of great Ships; and within others, that were ſunk narrowed the paſſage with ſome Steccadoes, and with the Guard of a good number of other Veſſels diſpoſed into ſeveral parts. The beſieged beheld the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this work with deriſion and ſcorn, making of it their paſtime, as ſuggeſted from the Genius of the Cardinal, who loving to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take actions of Fame, would quickly perceive, that the wit of man hath not the ſame ſtrength to execute great things, as it hath capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to deſign them; for the Sea, wont at certain times, when raiſed by great tempeſts, to bring in mountains of waters, and afterwards falling again as it were with a Precipice to diſcover the bottom, made it believed a raſh attempt to contend with Nature, by fighting with the violence of ſo powerful an Element. Nevertheleſs, the work going on with infinite labour, it was eaſier for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the wonder, than break it by force.</p>
               <p>Princes had their attention fixed upon this great Undertaking, with various aims and thoughts; <hi>Buckingham,</hi> touched with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations of revenge and honour, made ready another powerful Fleet to repair the unhappineſs of his attempts with better ſucceſs; but the others, which were in concert with him, though greatly inclined to it, yet durſt not perform the promiſed ſuccours. The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> although the ruine of them was in queſtion that were joyned to them by the likeneſs of Religion, yet obliged to <hi>France,</hi> and in neceſſity of their aſſiſtance, contributed ſecret wiſhes for the proſperity of their common Religion, but were bound by vertue of Treaties to ſend certain Ships for the Service of that Crown. <hi>Spain</hi>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:53750:141"/>
alone rejoyced at the Ingagement of theſe Forces, whilſt in place of being able to have conteſted the contrivances they framed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they conſumed their Armies and blood amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olivares</hi> therefore careful to prolong it, put on a more ſtrict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence with <hi>Richelieu,</hi> nouriſhed by Letters, by Embaſſies, and alſo by greater appearances: For that, to frighten the contrary Party, and to make a ſhew of putting in execution the ſecret Concerts and tacite Alliances contracted betwixt the two Crowns, <hi>Frederick di Toledo</hi> parts about the end of the year out of the Ports of <hi>Spain</hi> with a good number of Gallions, and in the ſight of <hi>Rochel</hi> joyns with the <hi>French</hi> Fleet; but being but ſlenderly victualled and man'd, returned quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into his own Country.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> foreſeeing, by the ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the States of <hi>Mantua,</hi> a ſtorm at hand, and an imminent need of ſtranger ſuccours, deplored, that King <hi>Lewis</hi> in perſon with the flower of his Forces was imployed ſo far from them, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſtirring him up to reflections on the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſollicited by moſt effectual endeavours, performed by <hi>Giorgio Giorgio</hi> and <hi>Luigi Contarini,</hi> their Ambaſſadours in <hi>France</hi> and at <hi>London,</hi> both the Kings to a Peace, and to ſacrifice to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Republick ſome relaxation from the fervency of their hatred and anger.</p>

            <p>WOuld to God, that, as often as there is occaſion to name the Intereſt of Princes and the Ambition of their Miniſters, Juſtice, humane Reaſon, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law might go along with them. But the World being toſſed to and fro by thoſe two Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which with equal provocations, though for the moſt part diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent iſſues, do not leave great Princes contented, nor the leſſer ones in quiet, it is no wonder, if from thence proceed events lamentable, and ſuch cruel calamities. While ſome are flattered with hopes; and others thruſt on by fear; all are at laſt in a continual diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance from emulations, jealouſies, hatreds, and the greedineſs of Dominion. And for this cauſe quiet cannot laſt long, nor the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of Peace be enjoyed, eſpecially in <hi>Italy,</hi> which being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many, ſome very powerful, others more weak, remains by conſequence more expoſed to various paſſions, and experiences moſt commonly greater commotions; whence Wars, like waves of the Sea, always fluctuating, either by the motion of the winds, or the remainder of paſt ſtorms, riſe up one after another. So the Arms taken up for the Affairs of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> were ſcarce laid down but there appeared new jealouſies, by reaſon of the ſucceſſion of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> and a War brake forth, both ſad and memorable for the quality of the motives and the variety of ſucceſſes.</p>
            <p>Many Princes took part in it, and upon it followed plagues and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53750:142"/>
univerſal calamities, which in the flood of miſchiefs and blood have in a manner changed the face of <hi>Europe,</hi> ruining the powerful, and raiſing up Princes little leſs than unknown. The Houſe of <hi>Gonzagha,</hi> which reigned in <hi>Mantua,</hi> was now conſidered, without iſſue Male, and without hopes of having any, as it were a dead Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſs of Fortune, neither could <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Vincenzo</hi> leave after them other than the young Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> their Niece, who as a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man excluded from the Inveſtiture of the Dutchy of <hi>Mantua,</hi> had ſome reaſon, though doubtful, to pretend to that of <hi>Monferrat.</hi> In her Marriage therefore ſeeming lodged the pledge of Peace, or the ſeeds of great contention, many believed it expedient to marry her to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Rhetel,</hi> Son of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and lawful Heir. This branch tranſplanted into a foreign ſoil, ſprang nevertheleſs from the ſame root, coming from <hi>Lodowick Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zagha,</hi> Son of <hi>Frederick,</hi> the firſt Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with his lot, that by reaſon of his age his other Brothers ſhould be preferred before him in the ſucceſſion to his Fathers Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, ſought in <hi>France,</hi> and by Marriage met with a better Fortune; whence his Heirs enjoyed with plentiful Revenues three large Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, of <hi>Nevers,</hi> of <hi>Rhetel,</hi> and of <hi>Maine.</hi> But for that this Houſe was in a manner naturalized in <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who, as ſoon as <hi>Mary</hi> was born, had endeavoured to get her into their power, expreſly to divert the danger of ſuch a Succeſſion, abhorred him above all, to the end not to introduce the <hi>French</hi> into the heart of <hi>Italy,</hi> and into two Countries which have the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> in the middle. They therefore promoted the pretenſions of <hi>Ferrant,</hi> Prince of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalla,</hi> a branch alſo of the Houſe of <hi>Gonzagha,</hi> but who derived his Pedigree further off, coming from the ſecond Son of <hi>Franceſco,</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> Father of <hi>Frederick</hi> the firſt Duke. But as much as they favoured him in the Imperial Court with benefits, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where elſe with declarations, ſo much was <hi>France</hi> the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to ſtrengthen the Rights of <hi>Nevers.</hi> Whereupon at the time <hi>Monſieur de Chaſteauneuf</hi> went from <hi>Venice,</hi> as he paſſed by <hi>Mantua,</hi> he had inſinuated the Marriage of <hi>Mary</hi> with <hi>Rhetel,</hi> and the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> concurring in the ſame opinion, put the Duke in mind of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the Succeſſion in his life time, and with it the Peace of <hi>Italy.</hi> But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> apprehending troubles, or hoping for a longer life, or conſidering his Brother <hi>Vincenzo,</hi> who by ſecret love ingaged in the Marriage of <hi>Iſabella di Buzzolo,</hi> and now ſatiated with thoſe paſſions, and by reaſon of her ſterility ſought to be ſeparated from her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred ſo long, that death in the end of the year paſt ſeized him. <hi>Vincenzo</hi> was his Succeſſor, who by ſending to <hi>Venice,</hi> as Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour Extraordinary, the Marqueſs <hi>Paulo Emilio Gonzagha,</hi> gave knowledge of it to the Senate, confiding to them his thoughts to break his Marriage and eſpouſe the Niece: But though he were young enough in years, yet the conſtitution of his body being ſpent and decaying, and the right of the Sacrament juſtly prevailing with the Pope before the politick reaſons, the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſollicited him to prevent ſo remote and uncertain hopes by the Marriage of his Niece

to <hi>Rhetel.</hi> He delaying to reſolve, let the danger approach nearer, every one now concluding that that Line of the Dukes would in a ſhort time fail without Iſſue, who wholly given over to luſts and luxury, were looked at as puniſhed with ſterility by God for their fraudulent Marriages, Adulteries, and Lewdneſs, with which they had ſtained their name, and defiled their lives.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all, none watched on this buſineſs with a more attentive eye than <hi>Carlo Emanuel,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who by the death of <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenzo</hi> thought to revive his pretended Rights on <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and to colour it with the Marriage of <hi>Mary</hi> to his Son <hi>Maurice.</hi> In order to this, he proteſted to the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> againſt the diſpoſing of their common Niece without his conſent; and joyned practices with the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> to obtain it by force, if Treaties ſhould not ſuffice. Nor had he any difficulty to poſſeſs <hi>Olivares,</hi> who uſually calculated deſigns and ſucceſſes by his own opinion and hopes, with the behovefulneſs of excluding <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and keeping the <hi>French</hi> far off from <hi>Italy,</hi> and withal of the opportunity to take <hi>Caſale</hi> and a good part of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> he for his part ſhewing himſelf contented only with <hi>Trin,</hi> and a portion of the open Country. Though in truth reaſon did not conſent, yet the conjuncture ſharpned the perſwaſions of the Duke, and invited the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the undertaking; for <hi>France</hi> being engaged before <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in War, the Proteſtants every where beaten, and the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> by reaſon of the affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> diſtracted by great apprehenſions, they could not well diſcern who could be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſturb them. They well knew that <hi>Italy</hi> would be in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; but with what Forces? As for the Pope, although he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not their greatneſs, they were not deceived in believing, that he would proceed with great warineſs, and far from engaging in Arms. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> not wont to declare themſelves ſo eaſily, would be apt rather by complaints and endeavours to ſtir up others than move War alone. The <hi>Grand Duke</hi> under the Government of a Mother of the <hi>Austrian</hi> blood, did not as yet diſcern his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; and to the reſt of the Princes, together with Forces hearts were wanting. On the contrary, the Power of <hi>Spain</hi> ſaw it ſelf at the height of proſperity, with ſtore of Treaſure and puiſſant Armies, and by its Councils and Money, directing with an abſolute Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Intereſts and Forces of the Emperour, diſpoſed with no leſs Authority, as well of <hi>Germany,</hi> as of <hi>Spain</hi> and its other vaſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
            <p>Certainly it was not advantagious for <hi>Carlo</hi> to greaten the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> upon his own Borders; but being accuſtomed to aim only at the enlargement of his Territories, he propoſed to make uſe of them to make ſome conqueſt; and turn himſelf afterwards to the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the <hi>French</hi> to preſerve it, and by engaging the two Crowns in diſcord and Wars, ſell his adherence at a dearer rate, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (however unfaithful) to one and the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nevers</hi> had no ſupport, beſides the protection of <hi>France,</hi> but the juſtice of his cauſe, which he ſaw much conſidered by all, and in
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:53750:143"/>
particular by the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Venetians;</hi> but right prevailing little without force, he attempted by all ſorts of humiliation and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſubmiſſion and dependence to pacifie the <hi>Austrians,</hi> but all in vain; becauſe intereſt lying thwart, and looking at him born in <hi>France,</hi> and brought up there, with Goods, Countries, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they could never be perſwaded, that he would ſincerely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate himſelf from that Crown.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Lewis</hi> declared himſelf, that he would maintain him in his Right with all his Forces and with his own Perſon, if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to go into <hi>Italy;</hi> but finding himſelf ingaged with the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſuch a report ſerved only for an appearance, and the King, well knowing it, made tryal of the way of a Treaty, having ſent <hi>Monſieur de Saint Simon</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to the end he might diſpoſe him to ſtrengthen the Rights of <hi>Nevers</hi> by the Marriage formerly propoſed. The Ambaſſadour found the Duke ſtill deluded with the hopes he ſhould live long; ſo that he obtained nothing elſe but the gaining of the Marqueſs <hi>Striggio,</hi> upon whoſe counſels <hi>Vincenzo</hi> moſtly relyed, to promote the cauſe and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of <hi>Nevers,</hi> when the occaſion ſhould be preſented. He returns then into <hi>France;</hi> but the deſigns of the <hi>Savoyards</hi> diſcovering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to advance, in proportion as the diſſolution of the Marriage was ſcrupled at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the indiſpoſitions of the Duke increaſed in <hi>Mantua,</hi> he was ſent back to <hi>Carlo Emanuel</hi> to offer him Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues and Lands in <hi>Monferrat,</hi> in exchange of his pretenſions, and withal to demonſtrate to him; <hi>How much it was better for him rather to preſerve Peace in</hi> Italy, <hi>than give nouriſhment to the Potency of</hi> Spain, <hi>againſt which he having in other times made his breaſt a defence, he ought not to obſcure the Glory of it by new Maxims, foreign to his own advantage and his ancient practices.</hi> But the Duke ſo much the more high and lofty, as he was ſmoothed and ſought to, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the advantages propoſed equal to his hopes, pretended a great Party of the <hi>Monferrat,</hi> not only on the ſcore of his old Rights, but as a kind of revenge, that <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had not performed the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome few years before concluded, and turning the ſtate of affairs and times to his own advantage, conſidered, that <hi>Spain</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining reſolute to hinder, that a Prince protected by, or rather ſubject to <hi>France,</hi> ſhould have Soveraignty in <hi>Italy,</hi> it was beſt for him to make uſe of his own connivence and force for the poſſeſſing of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> rather than leave it in prey to the more powerful. Whilſt he had his thoughts bent upon this in <hi>Turin,</hi> greater induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fell out in <hi>Mantua,</hi> where the Duke, by the crazineſs he had contracted, fallen very ſick, gave occaſion for many treacheries and deſigns. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> Son of the Prince of <hi>Guaſtalla,</hi> was then in <hi>Milan</hi> to promote the intereſt of his Family, or rather to have his Name made uſe of by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who, laying hold of any pretext, armed pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, and ordered many contrivances and preparations to prevent the attempts, which <hi>Nevers</hi> might make; and, ſending four thouſand Foot and one thouſand Horſe to the Confines of <hi>Mantua,</hi> under the Count <hi>de Guerrara,</hi> waited only till the Duke ſhould expire, to enter
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53750:143"/>
and take poſſeſſion of it. But <hi>Vincenzo,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">An. Dom. </seg>1628</label> by the perſwaſions of <hi>Strig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio,</hi> had in great ſecrecy called to him <hi>Rhetel,</hi> that he might marry the Princeſs, and be in the City at the time of his death, the better to ſecure to himſelf the Succeſſion and Principality; and he with a ſeaſonable diligence being arrived there unlooked for, diſſipated a great ſtorm before it brake forth; for many of the chief perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing averſe to the very name of the <hi>French,</hi> abhorred to have <hi>Nivers</hi> their Soveraign, and entertained Treaties and Intelligences, to raiſe as ſoon as the Duke ſhould be dead and before, ſome commotion in favour of <hi>Guaſtalla</hi> and of <hi>Spain;</hi> for which purpoſe <hi>Franceſco Rota</hi> Serjeant Major, had been corrupted, and many Arms were gathered together in the houſe of <hi>Frederick Gonzagha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, ſo ſoon as <hi>Rhetel</hi> was arrived, the Duke immediately made him Lieutenant General, and the better to corroborate his Right, by a ſolemn Teſtament declares him Heir. To perfect the Marriage, nothing was wanting, but the Diſpenſation of the Pope, by reaſon of the Kindred. St. <hi>Simon</hi> was come to <hi>Mantua</hi> to ſollicite it, and the Count of <hi>Serbellone</hi> was diſpatched from <hi>Milan</hi> by his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and proteſtations to hinder it, and from the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Mondovi;</hi> but they came too late: For the diſpence from <hi>Rome</hi> ſeaſonably arriving at the inſtant that the night after <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-day the Duke dyed, the Marriage was conſummated that very hour, the Corps of <hi>Vincenzo</hi> being yet warm, who, it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out, had by his laſt words ordained it. The day following the Bridegroom, together with mourning, aſſumes the Title of Prince of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and having in his power the Garriſon and the Citadel called <hi>Porto,</hi> requires from the people the Oath of Fidelity in the Name of his Father. <hi>Guaſtalla</hi> publiſhes a Patent of the Emperours Commiſſary, ſecretly afterwards obtained by the favour of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, in which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> enjoyns to him to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Emperours Name of the Country of <hi>Mantua,</hi> till the right ſhould be declared, without innovating any thing, requiring <hi>Cordua,</hi> that now governed <hi>Milan,</hi> to maintain the Decree by force, if need required. He had thoughts of going himſelf to <hi>Mantua;</hi> but ſeeing the paſſage ſtopt by the anticipations of <hi>Rhetel,</hi> he ſends the Count <hi>Mandelli</hi> to <hi>Caſale</hi> to cooperate in practices, which <hi>Cordua</hi> had ſet on foot there, and to alienate the minds of that people from acknowledging the new Prince. But all in vain, becauſe the name of <hi>Nevers,</hi> by the endeavours chiefly of <hi>Trajano Viſcardi,</hi> great Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, was by thoſe of <hi>Caſale</hi> and the <hi>Monferrins</hi> with univerſal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe cryed up.</p>

               <p>The Intereſts of Princes being now diſcovered, and the ſecrets unveiled, Reaſon or Juſtice were no longer debated in the Cauſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but calculations made of force, opportunity, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; ſo that it was like a fluctuant Sea, from which proceeded, and whither tended the affections of Princes, as they were more or leſs
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53750:144"/>
inclined to the one or other Party. At <hi>Venice</hi> they were all agreed to maintain the liberty of <hi>Italy</hi> and their own ſafety, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be in danger, by the oppreſſion of a neighbour State, but they were as much differing about the means; ſome with offices alone deſiring to divert the dangers, others by open declarations not declining to oppoſe the deſigns of the <hi>Auſtrians.</hi> There wanted not inclinations to enter into Alliance with <hi>France;</hi> but others cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind the late proceedings of that Crown in the Affairs of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and eſteeming the aſſiſtance of Strangers little leſs diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious to this Country, than the injuries of War, preferred a League with the Pope and other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> with whom form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a middle Party, they believed it eaſie to protect the Juſtice of <hi>Nevers</hi> by Negotiation, and defend themſelves on all occaſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt violence. This opinion was repreſented by the Senate to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> who no whit perplexed, was wavering amidſt divers conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, not deſiring to be ingaged againſt the power and rage of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> nor ſeeing willingly the power of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to be increaſed in <hi>Italy,</hi> or the Authority and Name of the Emperour, greatly ſuſpicious to the Popes, to be awakned. He not only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the remonſtrance of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> but in a manner promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, frequently complaining to their Ambaſſadour of the iniquity of the times, in which from a cauſe moſt unjuſt the ambition of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces was going to ſubvert the repoſe of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſcarce yet ſetled. He offered his interpoſition with powerful offices; but added, <hi>What can be promiſed from reaſon without Arms, in dealing with him who places Reaſon and Juſtice in nothing but Arms? The exceſs of power in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces makes little account of the Popes prayers, and their Mediation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced almoſt to nothing elſe but to adorn the Frontiſpice of Treaties with their name. It is meet, ſince offices do no good, to apply to other remedies more powerful: To improve the thought of uniting the Princes of</hi> Italy <hi>in their own and the common Intereſt. But beſides his own Forces and thoſe of the Republick, of whom was there any account to be made? The Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>renouncing the ancient Glory of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Liberty of</hi> Italy, <hi>unmindful of his age, and of a Grave at hand, contrives new Stratagems. The Government of</hi> Tuſcany <hi>was inclined to the advantages of the</hi> Auſtrians. <hi>In the others power was wanting or will. The Senate therefore was ſeriouſly to conſider, if the Forces alone of the Church and theirs would be a ſufficient defence againſt the approaching evils, and to maintain the Cauſe of</hi> Mantua, <hi>threatned, and, may be ſaid, oppreſſed by the proſperity of the Emperour and the Potency of</hi> Spain. <hi>That he was ready with counſels and action to run the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fate of</hi> Italy, <hi>but that it was alſo a common Intereſt to lean to the more powerful for the upholding of themſelves and friends. That he thought application to</hi> France <hi>was neceſſary, whoſe friendſhip, though by its inconſtancy it ſeemed dangerous, by its power made it ſelf ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. That he was diſpoſed with his intentions, offices, and endeavours to ſecond the reſolutions of that Crown and the Common-wealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The aims of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> were not in truth conformable to his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. He deſired to maintain <hi>Nevers</hi> in the ſucceſſion of <hi>Mantua;</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:53750:144"/>
but abhorred to ingage himſelf ſo far, as to be obliged to come to a Declaration or taking up of Arms. He encouraged the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to the end he might enjoy their ſupport in whatſoever ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and flattered the <hi>French</hi> with hopes of adhering to their Party; for if he had the luck to bring him into <hi>Italy</hi> in favour of <hi>Nevers,</hi> he doubted not but things would proceed with ſuch a ballance, that he might reſerve to himſelf the glory of the mediation, and the merit of making the Peace. Frequent advertiſements were then ſent from <hi>Venice</hi> and from <hi>Rome</hi> to King <hi>Lewis</hi> of the State of <hi>Italy,</hi> diſquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by great apprehenſions, and threatned by greater dangers, ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing him to imploy Authority, Negotiation, and Force for the ſaving of the Country and the Princes his Friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France</hi> in effect, was greatly ſenſible, and the principal Miniſters confeſſed the Reputation and Honour of the Crown ruined, if it failed to aſſiſt <hi>Nevers.</hi> But the Ingagement before <hi>Rochel</hi> was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly important; whereupon they turn their counſels anew to prevail upon the mind of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> becauſe he, it ſeemed, was the Arbiter of the Peace or of the War; whilſt, if it could be brought about to ſeparate him from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> their taking Arms would be diverted, or at leaſt weakned.</p>
               <p>The center therefore of the buſineſs lay in <hi>Turin;</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> on the one ſide aſſaulting him with reaſons and perſwaſions, and the <hi>French</hi> on the other tempting him with promiſes and advantages. St. <hi>Simon,</hi> beſides the ceading of ſo much Land in <hi>Monferrat</hi> as ſhould amount to twelve thouſand Crowns of yearly Revenue, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to him ſecret and great hopes, that <hi>France</hi> with a more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful aſſiſtance ſhould joyn in promoting his undertakings againſt the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> the differences with whom, aſſumed by the Crowns with the title of an authoritave mediation, remained yet undecided. But the Duke, mindful of former accidents, relinquiſhed not, for the uncertainty of things to come, the deſigns of preſent advantages. Clogging the Treaty therefore by the demand of <hi>Trin,</hi> a place of moſt important ſituation, becauſe it was oppoſite to <hi>Caſal,</hi> and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into length, he no leſs precipitated the reſolutions and getting into Arms. Upon the news of the death of Duke <hi>Vincenzo,</hi> and what had happened in <hi>Mantua,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Mondovi,</hi> and <hi>Serbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi> were returned back to relate it to the Duke and to <hi>Cordua,</hi> who agreeing in their aims, aggravated alſo with uniform diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions; <hi>That the young Princeſs, Niece of the Catholick King, and alſo of the Duke, was, without their knowledge, forced rather, upon the dead body of the deceaſed Duke, amidſt ſobs and tears, than married by her own free conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Cordua</hi> charges <hi>Rhetel</hi> with the contempt of having intruded himſelf into a State in conteſt, contrary to the Commiſſions &amp; Patents of the Emperor, Soveraign and Judge of the Parties, to whom being required to refer the cognizance of the cauſe and the penalty of the boldneſs, he refuſed the Letters, which he had written to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Title aſſumed of Prince of <hi>Mantua.</hi> The eyes of all men were, to ſay truth, turned towards <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> ſome ſheltering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53750:145"/>
under his Authority, and others conſidering his Power. Amongſt the firſt, were the Princes of <hi>Guaſtalla,</hi> whoſe intereſt ſerved not but for a bounded proſpect, and ſtalking Horſe for the Arms of <hi>Spain;</hi> and <hi>Margaret,</hi> Dutcheſs of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who, as eldeſt Siſter of the laſt Dukes deceaſed, pretended, that the Males of the other Branch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excluded, the Succeſſion belonged to her; but her Rights being very little conſidered, they could amount to no more but to uſher in thoſe of <hi>Leonora</hi> the Empreſs, her younger Siſter. Whilſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was like to proceed with great length of time, the new Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> and the Princes that adhered to him, apprehended the Emperours Forces, jealouſly obſerving an Army of ſixteen thouſand men, under a Count of <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> in <hi>Suaben,</hi> kept on foot there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of bridling the motions of the Marqueſs of <hi>Dourlach</hi> and the Proteſtants; but in effect, as a body of reſerve for the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> at the diſpoſition of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> the which, not only by benefits and penſions, held dependent on it the Emperours chief Miniſters, but upbraided to himſelf the holding the Imperial Dignity as but the fruit of their counſels and aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Since therefore <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was obliged to depend on anothers will, the preſſing inſtances of the Popes Miniſters and the <hi>Venetians</hi> availed little, who perſwaded him not to intereſt himſelf but with his Authority in favour of the cauſe, which ſhould appear moſt juſt, and to prefer Negotiation before a Rupture. Nevertheleſs, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the deſigns, which were reſolved on long before, the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts made ſhew of an outward inclination to quiet, and to amuſe the Common-wealth, who appeared to be more alarmed than any body elſe; the Count of <hi>Verdenberg,</hi> Chancellor of the Hereditary Provinces, entertained <hi>Pietro Vico,</hi> their Reſident, with frequent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of breaking into a War with the <hi>Turk,</hi> now <hi>Germany</hi> being re-united did almoſt all acknowledge the Religion of Chriſt and the Laws of the Emperour; ſtirring up the Republick to be willing by a cloſe union to participate of the Victories and Triumphs, which were deſtined from Heaven for the Piety and Greatneſs of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Senate, from ſuch generous conceptions, fitly drew ſtronger motives to exhort to Peace, and remove Jealouſies from <hi>Italy,</hi> to the end, that with a chearful heart and open Arms, Chriſtendom might once deliver it ſelf from the unworthy ſhackles of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm. But pretence and diſſembling could no longer have place; for Signor <hi>Agnelli,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſent Ambaſſadour Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary by the Duke, ſo ſoon as by ſecret ways he was come into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> being arrived at <hi>Vienna</hi> to demand the Inveſtiture, and offer his duty and obedience to the Emperour, was not received, his abode at Court as a Prelate and private perſon being hardly obtained. St. <hi>Simon</hi> at <hi>Turin</hi> leaves the Court, having diſcovered, that the Duke, too cloſely joyned with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> minded no more whatſoever propoſition was made him. At his parting, he intimates to certain <hi>French</hi> that were yet in the Dukes pay, to leave it, and put themſelves into <hi>Caſal,</hi> which proved a ſeaſonable ſuccours, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:53750:145"/>
helped much to maintain that place, expoſed as the price and prey of the enſuing War.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo Emanuel</hi> had contented himſelf to leave it in the diviſion to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> together with <hi>Ponteſtura, Nizza, Aqui,</hi> and all that Tract, which towards the Sea was near to the Plains; retaining for himſelf <hi>Trino, Alba,</hi> St. <hi>Damiano,</hi> with the parcel more commodious and contiguous to his States, on condition nevertheleſs, that, as he (to take away jealouſie) ſhould not fortifie his new conqueſts, ſo the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould reduce <hi>Caſal</hi> to that weakneſs wherein it was in ancient times. Nor had the Contractors made any difficulty to promiſe the promotion of one anothers advantages, becauſe each ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that new accidents would afterwards diſoblige them from the obſervance of the conditions; whereupon, although in <hi>Milan</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Montenegro,</hi> amongſt others, diſſented from it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnoſticated with great wiſdom, (as it quickly fell out) that the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of ſo difficult and jealous a conqueſt would be more certain than the advantages; <hi>Gonzales</hi> nevertheleſs, greedy of renown and glory, and deſirous above all to confirm himſelf in the Government of <hi>Milan,</hi> as a neceſſary Miniſter and confided in, colours the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to the Council of <hi>Spain</hi> as ſo eaſie and certain, that he had the hap to get their conſent. He principally grounded himſelf upon the Intelligence which he held within <hi>Caſal,</hi> and aſſured himſelf to be made Maſter of it before the deſign or motion towards it ſhould be diſcovered; whence carried away with the Fame of the Action, and not minding the <hi>French</hi> Succours, he boaſted, that in that place <hi>Mantua</hi> would be taken alſo, nay all <hi>Italy,</hi> while no man would be able to withdraw himſelf from the yoke, if the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> led to it chiefly by his Arts, whilſt he framed it for others, laid it upon himſelf. <hi>Olivares,</hi> who making light of the conſequences of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards to come, was wont to embrace greedily the occaſions of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent profit, ſpeeding the ratification of the Treaty into <hi>Italy,</hi> and cauſing a hundred thouſand Crowns to be diſburſed to the Duke to quicken the action, inflames him with Letters full of flatteries and Encomiums, to do himſelf once reaſon by Arms, and revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf generouſly of the wrongs, which he pretended to have been at ſeveral times done him by the Houſe of <hi>Gonzagha.</hi> The Governor had not in readineſs above twelve thouſand Foot and three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and of theſe one body lodged towards <hi>Como,</hi> to have an eye upon the paſſages of the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Griſons,</hi> and he ſent another with the Marqueſs of <hi>Montenegro</hi> into the <hi>Cremoneſe,</hi> not only to reſtrain the ſuſpected reſolutions of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Duke himſelf, who increaſing his Forces by certain money drawn from his Goods in <hi>France,</hi> had, by the applauſe of his Name and the Novelty of the War, raiſed about ten thouſand Souldiers; 4000 whereof were in <hi>Monferrat</hi> and at <hi>Caſal,</hi> and the reſt he kept about himſelf at <hi>Mantua. Cordua</hi> therefore could not have advanced in the attempt of <hi>Monferrat</hi> but with weak Forces, if thoſe of the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> had not ſtrengthened him, who, after having ſtipulated, in contemplation of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, a Truce for ſix months with

the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> not being able yet to reſcue themſelves from the dependence on that Crown, nor renounce the memory of freſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, although they had a due apprehenſion of the War at hand, ſent to the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> a good body of their Souldiers, who, when they were come into the Territory of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> put up im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colours. To facilitate the enterpriſe for him, he made Edicts his fore-runners, full of bitter threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whomſoever ſhould reſiſt, and of large promiſes to thoſe, who without expecting Force would render themſelves.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, doubtful, leſt the Troops ſent to the Confines of the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhould ſerve rather to provoke than check them, he ſent to the Senate to amuſe them, till <hi>Caſal</hi> ſhould be taken, <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Rho,</hi> who declared, <hi>The intention of the King to be only to take poſſeſſion of thoſe Countries, which were fallen to the judgment of the Emperor, and in his Name to keep them till the Rights of the Pretenders being known, they might be reſtored to their lawful Lord.</hi> He aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the goodneſs of the King himſelf, and to the prudence of his Miniſters in <hi>Italy,</hi> that foreſeeing diſturbances imminent, they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed authority with zeal to keep it from Tumults. He then by a large circumference of words let them underſtand, that the alone ſuſpicion, leſt the <hi>French,</hi> under the name of <hi>Nevers,</hi> ſhould neſtle themſelves upon the Borders of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> had moved the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour to this prevention and attacque. By the Senate, who knew his ends, was gravely anſwered, <hi>That the diſſatisfaction of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick could not at all be concealed, whilſt the Peace of</hi> Italy <hi>was ready to be ſplit, which they taking to heart above any other motive, could not but be fervent in the deſires, and inſiſt earneſtly on the remonſtrances of Peace, believing that in that did conſiſt the Glory of the King himſelf, the happineſs of his States, and the moderation of his Miniſters.</hi> But amidſt the motions and furies of Arms, thruſt by the Governor into the field, all reaſons and offices were to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> therefore were put upon difficult counſels, and the Senate being aſſembled to debate the matter, <hi>Simeon Contarini,</hi> Knight and Procurator, ſpake thus: <hi>With the ſtraights of the preſent time God joyn the conſtancy of the Republick and the wiſdom of them that govern it. Theſe are not the firſt difficulties with which the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try hath been exerciſed, but obſerving the memorable Acts of our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, we ought to confeſs, that if Nature give the Snake an inſtinct to find the ſtraightneſs of ſtones, where leaving his old skin, he re-acquires youthful vigour, God imparts to men prudence, which amidſt the moſt diſaſtrous and difficult Encounters ſharpens it ſelf, and ſubduing adverſe Fortune, gets the Victory at laſt, and perpetuates the felicity of Countries. But it is not needful, O Fathers, that we here go out of the path beaten by the wiſe Counſels of thoſe that have tranſmitted to us for an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance together with liberty this Empire. I would ſay, that the moſt violent reſolutions and the moſt headlong courſes are not the Arts of our Fathers, or the Maxims of our Government. Time holding prudence by the hand, hath lead us often out of the darkeſt Labyrinths, and the Republick preſerving Veneration to its Councils, reſpect to its Arms, and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53750:146"/>
Treaſures and Forces for opportunities, hath maintained it ſelf in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, aſſiſted its friends, and preſerved</hi> Italy. <hi>Now I deny not but that the preſent attempts of the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Armies, and the threatnings of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſigns envenom to the quick the health of this unhappy Country, and confound mens minds and our own very intereſts. But let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine carefully the remedy before we apply it, and reflecting upon the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the evil, let us ballance the ſtrength of the medicine. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil this ſtrong Torrent overflow, it is ſufficient to ſtand within the Banks, and be contented that the courſe bend another way, and carry the Tide thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for if the violence of men be oppoſed to the Juſtice of God, as it comes not to be endured by the Conſtitution of the World, ſo it muſt needs be ſhort, and within a little while, where it was exalted in pride, it will be ſeen humbled and brought low. Great is that Power of the</hi> Auſtrians, <hi>which without obſtacle runs ſwelling, as may be ſaid, over the flouriſhing field of liberty and the dignity of ſo many oppreſſed Princes. But he that will oppoſe himſelf with proteſts, threatnings, and Arms, let him ſhew me alſo a force equal to that which ought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. My meaning is, that reſolutions ſhould be ſuſpended, that the tendency of affairs ſhould be obſerved, that under the ſhadow of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and prudence this ſtorm of ill Fortune ſhould be let paſs. The ruines, cauſed by a Thunderbolt, are for the moſt part repaired with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle trouble, but to the violence of its flames what humane force is there that can reſiſt? I confeſs it, I am much afraid of the iſſue of the preſent Affairs; but yet I deſpair not. I ſee</hi> Cordua, <hi>I ſee the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>united to invade the</hi> Monferrat, <hi>to ſwallow that Country, and take</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale; <hi>I feel the weight of the Chains of the Servitude of</hi> Italy; <hi>I fear the Counterblow of</hi> Mantua <hi>in our own very Bowels. But who knows? Some Politick Counſels, which invite with a fair Proſpective, are not ordinarily practiſed without difficulty, and end not but with misfortune. The Enterpriſe on</hi> Caſal <hi>will not perhaps be ſo eaſie, as it is ſuppoſed.</hi> Carlo Emanuel <hi>is not ſo tenacious in his Alliances, but that he may be altered; the Forces of the Governour of</hi> Milan <hi>are not ſo powerful as to be able to oppreſs</hi> Italy <hi>in a moment. Where are thoſe Enſigns, thoſe Armies ſo much feared of the Emperours? It ſeems to me, that there is great hopes that they are not ſo eaſily to deſcend into</hi> Italy; <hi>becauſe thoſe vaſt Provinces of</hi> Germany, <hi>kept under by</hi> Ferdinand <hi>with a foot of Iron, will quickly lift up their head, being rather oppreſſed than over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. We ought alſo to believe, that</hi> France <hi>will quickly be diſ-ingaged from the Sea-coaſt. Will then that warlike Nation, that magnanimous King, and that prudent Miniſter poſſibly ſuffer a Prince to be excluded from his Inheritance and from his Patrimony, for no other fault but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born under the Climate of</hi> France; <hi>and if they ſhould ſet at nought Juſtice, Honour, and Intereſt, ought the Republick always to take upon it ſelf alone the burden of being the Defender, not only of juſt Cauſes, but of the weaker ſides? On the other ſide, if, as reaſon requires, the</hi> French <hi>ſhall reſolve to take part in it, what avails it to torment our ſelves with unſeaſonable afflictions, and diſhearten our ſelves with ſad Divinations, whilſt the Affairs now under debate will counſel the Senate to reſolve themſelves for the occaſion, and to preſerve their ſtrength and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53750:147"/>
Treaſure for the accidents of time. Will the Republick otherwiſe be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly able to contend alone with the vaſt Power of the Houſe of</hi> Auſtria? <hi>and with the dreaded Force of the Empire? Foreſeeing then ruine, ſhall we foreſtall deſtruction, and in the vain ſupport of the Duke of</hi> Mantua <hi>ſink down our ſelves, even before the danger and ſeaſon comes, over and above the loſſes of the Publick and our own? Much, as to former ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, is</hi> Italy <hi>indebted to us, and I think it needful to ſpeak it, our preſent weakneſs is but a remainder of the exceſs of former Forces. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold when we were perſwaded, that with ſo much treaſure and ſo many benefits we had unſeparably bound the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>to our friendſhip, we ſee him, united to the Crown of</hi> Spain, <hi>turn himſelf againſt the good of</hi> Italy. <hi>Behold our Ingagements in the</hi> Valteline, <hi>where with money and blood we have maintained the common Intereſt and the honour of the Confederates, degenerated into moſt prejudicial agreements betwixt the Crowns. That benefit is too dear, which, together with ingratitude, produces damage. Wherefore taught from paſt experiences, my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that placing our ſafeguard in Prudence rather than in Fortune, we ſhould maintain the defence of our ſelves with powerful Forces; but I approve not of Declarations, Ingagements, and Wars, to the end we may not heedleſly expoſe to hazard the Government with the liberty of the Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great was the attention to this diſcourſe, but it was interrupted by <hi>Dominico Molino</hi> with a contrary ſenſe to this purpoſe: <hi>Neither deſires nor hopes can divert our dangers, againſt which were fear a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient defence, I ſhould believe our affairs ſecure, becauſe I confeſs, that I am afraid. I am not alone incumbred with the tempeſtuous appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the preſent ſtate of things; but in the intereſts and dangers of the Duke of</hi> Mantua, Italy <hi>both fears and trembles. It is true, that the treacherous lethargie which oppreſſes him, takes away from ſome Princes the ſenſe of the common evils, and that others in an apparent</hi> Delirium <hi>extravagate from that path of their own and univerſal intereſt, which they have walked in with glory. But behold, let us ſee alſo in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, where at laſt is lodged the heart of the ſafety of</hi> Italy, <hi>the vital ſpirits of liberty and honour beat. Let us hearken to the language of the Pope, who abhors the immoderate machinations of</hi> Spain, <hi>who invites the</hi> French, <hi>and ſollicites to get Companions. Things then are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable to that degree, that we ſhould deſpair of a remedy, if we ſhall be willing to apply it in the beginning; but if the diſeaſe ſhall go on, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by our negligence, ſuch will be the increaſe of it, that the recovery will be made more difficult than can be repented of. There are, O Fathers, in caſes of importance, three Springs, whence all diſaſters plentifully flow, which point by point in the contrary opinion I have throughly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; falſe ſecurity, careleſs delay, and a covetous fear of charge. Let us conſider the Duke of</hi> Mantua <hi>as a new Prince, a Stranger (as may be ſaid) to the Cuſtoms and to the Language, encompaſſed with Subjects un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, with a Militia that muſt be intreated, oppreſſed with neceſſity, ſtaggering under the weight of a State ſhaken by the Arms of ſo powerful Enemies, that who ſees him not ready to fall? Let us ſuppoſe</hi> Caſal <hi>almoſt without other Garriſon than the Inhabitants; deprived of all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:53750:147"/>
aſſailed by the forces and skill of the Governour of</hi> Milan, <hi>and by the deſigns and contrivements of</hi> Savoy, <hi>ſo that who expects it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon rendred as attempted? Now in this condition let us weigh our own dangers, and in the conſideration of them more than of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Duke, let us reſolve, if we can ſatisfie our own minds to deny him ſpeedy ſuccours. It may poſſibly be believed, that</hi> Caſal <hi>may hold out, that</hi> Savoy <hi>may revolt, that the</hi> Germans <hi>may ſtay their march, and that the</hi> French <hi>may paſs the</hi> Alps? <hi>But if ſuch hopes do but flatter us, of what then ſhall we be afraid to declare our ſelves in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Duke? O Fathers, theſe are Hobgoblins, and, give me leave to ſay ſo, falſe Viſions, repreſented from weakneſs and the fear accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying too wary Counſels. From the Precepts of our Anceſtors, and the Examples of all Princes, may ſufficiently be learnt, that by aſſiſting the weak ones, Power is either preſerved or increaſed. The Republick hath always had this belief, that the fruit of their quiet, and I will ſay of their parſimony was in a manner due to their friends. Thoſe Treaſures have been well ſpent, thoſe Cares happy, and Counſels wiſe, which in former times have preſerved this Country in ſafety, the Princes in their dignity, and our ſelves in our liberty. Let us not bluſh here to ſpeak it. Our aſſiſtances have been given out to uſury, with the manifold gain of our own tranquillity and glory. All the good which with vain flatteries and uncertain hopes is propoſed to us from Chance, we may reap from our own generous and wiſe deliberations; for the Duke, not abandoned of aſſiſtance, will take courage and ſtrength; his Subjects will get vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour;</hi> Caſal <hi>being ſuccoured, will defend it ſelf, and by holding out, will divert blows far from</hi> Mantua, <hi>and keep dangers remote from our Confines.</hi> France <hi>in this interim diſ-ingaged from</hi> Rochel, <hi>will joyn to make a ſeaſonable Counterpoiſe; but if ſtanding negligently idle, we ſhall behold the deſtruction of our Neighbours, what may we expect but to be abandoned by all, even in their own ruine? If to the</hi> French <hi>be objected the Rampiers of the</hi> Alps, <hi>which way ſhall we open them a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, if, when we ſhall have paſſed the Mountains,</hi> Caſal <hi>being loſt, they ſhall find the door ſhut? That Prince is reduced to a too lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that expects ſavour for himſelf alone from him that is an Enemy to all. Can we poſſibly hope to find in the</hi> Auſtrians <hi>moderation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect towards us? I, for my part, prefer ſecurity before hopes; becauſe we live in times in which Ambition bears rule, the Conjuncture is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, Intereſt is the Idol of Princes and the Corner-ſtone of States. I cannot frame to my ſelf reaſons more ſtrong, nor juſtice more apparent, how to indemnifie and ſave the Common-wealth, than that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears on the ſide of the Duke of</hi> Mantua; <hi>and if he be invaded, I fear the example; and if he be overcome, I apprehend, leſt Fortune ſhould juſtifie the luſt of Dominion. The will and a fit Conjuncture to break is enough for Princes to find abundant matter for occaſions and pretexts. Let us at leaſt reſolve upon that, which neceſſity, then which no eloquence is more powerful or more compendious, perſwades us; becauſe having once with a generous conſtancy blunted the edge of the pride of Strangers in</hi> Italy, <hi>Glory and Peace will for a long time reſide amongst us. But let us be mindful here, Fathers, that while we are conſulting,</hi> Caſal <hi>is
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53750:148"/>
loſing, and that if we delay to take our reſolution here, ſafety it ſelf will not be able to ſuccour it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe contrary opinions, the minds of the Senators were wavering, becauſe, beſides the weight of the reaſons of both the Parties, a certain diſcreet and experienced prudence produced great credit to the Author of the firſt, and the conceit of a great ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Politick matters did no leſs for the ſecond. At laſt, as it often happens, that in extremes equally difficult, middle counſels prevail, a third opinion was followed, which conſiſted in arming and ſtrongly fortifying themſelves in all kinds, to ſollicite <hi>France</hi> to maintain the Cauſe of the Duke, and when <hi>France</hi> ſhould ingage it ſelf, and ſend an Army on this ſide the Mountains, to joyn to it that of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick for the defence of <hi>Mantua,</hi> which could no more without difficulty receive ſuccours from elſewhere. The Senate alſo were willing, particularly in <hi>Spain,</hi> to repeat their moſt effectual offices for Peace, not becauſe they hoped, the Armies being ſo far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to divert them, but at leaſt to juſtifie the reſolutions to which they ſaw themſelves conſtrained. And, to ſay truth, their remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances were rather made known to, than conſidered by the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke; whereupon, all being reduced to extremes, ſollicitations were turned again towards <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But above that affair there aroſe great diviſions in the Kings Council, in which, according to the nature of the Nation, opinions degenerating into Factions, and in them paſſions and intereſts ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, both Miniſters and buſineſs were confounded. The Queen-mother had by nature a certain propenſion to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and nouriſhed a great averſion againſt <hi>Nevers,</hi> ever ſince, during her Regency, he joyned himſelf ſeveral times to the male-contents. But now there were added cauſes more urgent; for the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> (for ſo we will henceforward call the Kings Brother) his firſt Wife being dead, earneſtly deſired to take in ſecond Marriage <hi>Mary,</hi> the Daughter of the ſame <hi>Nevers,</hi> a Princeſs of exquiſite Beauties; on the other ſide, the Mother abhorring to ſee the Daughter of her Enemy, her Daughter-in-law, preferred <hi>Anna de Medici,</hi> Siſter of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> or <hi>Nichola de Loraine,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Henry,</hi> both allied to her in blood. And becauſe ſhe doubted, that the Cardinal inclined to <hi>Gonzagha,</hi> ſhe began from this ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to convert her favour into hatred, and their diſcord had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things to nouriſh it, as will hereafter render her paſſions as much more famous, as her life and death equally unhappy. She began then to inveigh againſt <hi>Richelieu,</hi> that, to play the Merchant at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with the Royal Authority, he became prodigal of the Kings health, keeping him, as having him in a manner a Priſoner far from his Wife and Mother, amongſt Armies and the Marſhes of <hi>Rochel,</hi> expoſed to dangers and in an unwholeſom Air. She, beſides this, diſſented openly to have any thing to do with the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> towards which ſhe diſcovered the Cardinal inclined, and aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he for his vain paſſions having ſtirred up a War with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> now to ſatiate his revenge, would break alſo with <hi>Savoy</hi>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:53750:148"/>
and with <hi>Spain,</hi> perſecuting every where the Princeſſes of the Royal Family, and expoſing the Kingdom in prey to the ſword and fire, to the end that he alone with his Friends and Kindred might triumph over the publick Calamities, and advance his ambition and avarice upon the common Ruine. By effectual Letters ſhe diſſwades the King from him, and publickly exclaims againſt him in <hi>Paris,</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many with whiſpers and diſcourſes in the Court and in the Country; for hatred and envy advanced as much againſt <hi>Richelieu</hi> as his own merit increaſed, and the favour of the King appeared more and more partial to him. The Cardinal <hi>Berule</hi> and <hi>Monſieur de Marilliac</hi> were the chief that in the Council ſided with her opinions; and to diſhearten the Miniſters of the Pope and of the Republick, who with frequent endeavours moved the King to ſerious reflections and ſeaſonable reſolutions, they divulged freely, and gave the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters themſelves openly to underſtand, that <hi>France</hi> by Religion and Intereſt being ſtrictly obliged to its own occaſions, could not be diverted elſewhere, nor attend to what happened beyond the Mountains. But <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who with a profound judgment fatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med aims and deſigns, as well domeſtick as foreign, entertaining them with better hopes; to repair that opinion, which after the Peace of <hi>Monzon</hi> he knew cooled in his old friends and the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> comforted them with ample promiſes, that the King would not be wanting in protection and aſſiſtance to the Houſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and exhorted principally the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſo much intereſſed and ſo nearly joyned, to ſupport the Duke with powerful Aids, till, the Ingagement before <hi>Rochel</hi> being at an end, and the differences with <hi>England</hi> in ſome meaſure compoſed, the Crown might turn all its Authority and Forces towards <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Senate wiſely weighing paſt events, and the dangers immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent remained conſtant in the ſetled Maxims, not to declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but conjoyntly with the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and therefore ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited with earneſt prayers the happy ſucceſs of the enterpriſe of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and with urgent mediation promoted the Peace with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which ſeemed much facilitated by various accidents; for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fleet being ſailed out of thoſe parts, formidable for number and quality of Ships, manned with choice Souldiers, and furniſhed with all ſorts of Proviſions, having ſcarce ſhewed it ſelf to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, and attempted the relief in vain, was returned to the Coaſt of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Incendiary of the diſcord, ſtabbed with a Knife in his Chamber by one <hi>Felton</hi> for private cauſes, was dead.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Cordua</hi> finding no reſiſtance in the field, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances towards <hi>Caſale,</hi> hoping, according to the concerts agreed with <hi>Spadino de Novara,</hi> Serjeant Major in the Town, that a Port ſhould preſently have been delivered to him. But the Marqueſs of <hi>Canoſſa,</hi> a <hi>Veroneſe,</hi> Governour of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and <hi>Rivara</hi> a <hi>Monfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> who commanded the Citadel, diſcovering the Plot, as it was almoſt ready to be put in execution, gave out Orders preſently for the defence, by preventing the Treachery and reſiſting the Force.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53750:149"/>
                  <hi>Spadino</hi> ſaving himſelf from puniſhment by flight, meets the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Milan</hi> with the Army near to <hi>Caſale,</hi> who, though touched to the quick, that his beſt and ſpeedy hope was vaniſhed, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs putting it to a venture, and ingaging his honour upon the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Traitor, that the Garriſon, though conſiſting of about four thouſand Foot and four hundred Horſe, yet all for the moſt part of the Country, and having want of many things, would, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Inhabitants, be little inclined to ſuffer for a Prince, they knew not, ruine and extremities, reſolves to undertake the Siege. To flatter the Citizens, he made as if he would reſpite the Country round about, keeping for ſome days the Militia in ſuch Diſcipline, that it almoſt looked as if he would rather preſerve than force the place. And the effect, though contrary to his intent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be ſo; for the proviſions, ſpared by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Country, were in the interim brought into the Town. At the firſt appearance of the Enemy, the Garriſon made a round Sally; but, being eaſily beat back, <hi>Cordua</hi> orders Trenches to be opened, and Batteries to be raiſed, but with as many failings and errours as they made ſteps in the attempt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſale</hi> is ſituate upon the right ſide of the <hi>Po,</hi> where a little Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock begins to decline and enlarge it ſelf into a Plain, in which the Town is placed, being of a large circuit, but of an irregular inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, inhabited by many noble Families and a numerous well-accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated Commonalty. A Caſtle with Walls and Towers ſerved formerly for its defence; but the old Duke <hi>Vincenzo</hi> placed there for ſtate and defence a Citadel of a great compaſs, with ſix well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Baſtions, which with two ranks of Walls were joyned to the City. Againſt one of theſe directly towards the <hi>Po,</hi> which at that time had its courſe a little diſtant, but afterwards, changing its Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, came nearer to the Wall, <hi>Gonzales</hi> directs his attacques and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries but weak and ſlow; ſo that the beſieged were able to cover with Half-moons and Batteries the Wall, the Mills, and the Flank of the Town, the moſt expoſed on that ſide. He could not, by reaſon he had ſo few men, begirt the place, and for the ſame defect defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for divers days to take in the Caſtles on the Hill, by means whereof Proviſions in abundance were frequently brought into the Town, and even when he went about it, <hi>Frederico Enriquez,</hi> ſent with a few Souldiers to make his way into <hi>Roſſignano</hi> by a Petard, being partly deceived by his Spies, who brought him thither when it was broad day light, and partly repulſed by the craggineſs of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it ſtood upon a Rock, received there a great blow. The <hi>Savoyards</hi> proceeded with greater ſucceſs. The Duke was no ſooner in the field but he poſſeſſed in a breath <hi>Alba,</hi> St. <hi>Damiano,</hi> with all that which belonged to him by the Treaty; and although <hi>Trino</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted ſome days, yet upon the loſs of a Half-moon it was forced to ſurrender. Being thus diſ-ingaged, it gave great jealouſie to the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> leſt having obtained his own deſign, he ſhould neglect, or rather hinder the ſucceſs of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him fixed in this, that ſhort Wars, frequent Treaties, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53750:149"/>
change of Parties was that which pleaſed him, he was greatly feared leſt he ſhould joyn with the <hi>French,</hi> fomenting that doubt by various events; for the Duke, contrary to the agreement, fortified <hi>Trino</hi> with all diligence, having taken <hi>Moncalvo,</hi> though it were not of his diviſion, kept it for himſelf, and <hi>Ponteſtura,</hi> which he had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed in the ſight almoſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Camp, though he delivered it to them, yet it was after delays ſo full of pride and contempt, that it ſavoured rather of reproach and injury than of confidence and aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>But above all, the things which happened afterwards at <hi>Genoua</hi> troubled him. That Government diſcovered, that <hi>Julio Ceſare Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chero,</hi> a man of the Commonalty, with other wicked Villains of his condition, had deſigned to kill the principal men, and change the form of Government, hoping in the confuſions, the Authority of the Laws being captivated, and good men expoſed to violence, they might with impunity enjoy great ſpoils. From him, who was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, and other his Complices, who having retired themſelves into the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> were by the Governour ſent back to <hi>Genoua,</hi> it came to be known that the Conſpiracy paſſed in concert with the Duke, who without diſſembling the matter, avowed that he had conſented to the Treaſon, before the Truce was made, to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when it ſhould be ended; and ſhewed himſelf ſo throughly moved at the danger his Partiſans were in, that he proteſted to the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> to revenge the puniſhments of thoſe that were guilty upon certain of their Nobles, which he had Priſoners ſince the laſt War; and with no leſs induſtry induced the Governour to ſend to <hi>Genoua Alvara di Luſara</hi> with no leſs threatnings than inſtances for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and liberty of thoſe malicious Knaves. The Government mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the atrocity of the offence and the anger for ſuch a demand, reſenting it to the quick, that they muſt be forced in complacence to their Enemy, or at anothers will to let Rebellion go unpuniſhed, having in a middle way betwixt Slavery and Juſtice condemned ſome to puniſhment, let for that time the buſineſs fall into ſilence. But the Duke not being ſatisfied, although he uſed no cruelty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> Priſoners, ſhewed himſelf wroth both againſt the Republick and againſt the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who apprehending not to get <hi>Caſale,</hi> and to expoſe the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> to irreparable hazards, whenſoever the Duke ſhould bend towards <hi>France,</hi> endeavoured by all ſort of ſatisfaction and pliantneſs to pacifie him. And for that cauſe denied to deliver to the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> others of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and gave ſecurity to ſome in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> making ſhew of ſo great rancour and diſguſts againſt that Republick, that the ſtate of things being repreſented at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> there alſo, to keep the Duke to his firſt deſigns and hopes, Propoſitions were treated of, to aſſault the State of <hi>Genoua</hi> with united Forces, divide it, and leave <hi>Carlo</hi> as large a part as he ſhould have a mind to. This, although it was againſt the true intentions of him that offered it, nevertheleſs coming to be known by the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> ſtirred up jealouſie in their minds, and a hatred ſo furious, in particular, when the Count <hi>de
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53750:150"/>
Monterey</hi> paſſing from <hi>Spain</hi> as Ambaſſadour towards <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtayed ſome time in <hi>Genoua,</hi> making a ſhew of a certain kind of Superiority, and as if he would take upon him to reform the Government, that the wonted partiality towards that Monarchy began to be cooled, and the veneration of it ſoon after declining in <hi>Italy,</hi> they went on to ſuch reſolutions and decrees as did greatly raiſe the Splendor and Decorum of that Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Monferrat,</hi> through the difficulty of the enterpriſe the faſt of the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> being abated, it looked as if hopes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of ſome adjuſtment, the Emperour giving the Miniſters of the Pope and of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to underſtand, <hi>That his intention was not to meddle in the Cauſe of</hi> Mantua <hi>otherwiſe than by Negotiation, whilſt the Governour of</hi> Milan <hi>having put himſelf into action without his knowledge and conſent, he found himſelf diſ-ingaged from aſſiſting his intentions with Arms.</hi> But within a while the Authority of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Miniſters prevailing above the others Reaſons, the Army of <hi>Suevia</hi> was obſerved to draw near to <hi>Helvetia,</hi> to the great jealouſie of the <hi>Cantons,</hi> who thereupon aſſembled frequent Diets; and it was underſtood, that Count <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> was ſent by the Emperour with Title of Commiſſioner, to take poſſeſſion of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat</hi> with all the appurtenances, aſſigning only to the Duke a meet Penſion to maintain him and ſome Lodgings in the Palace. This was interpreted as a certain Herald for War; becauſe the Duke not being able to do other than diſſent and oppoſe it, the ingagement of the Name and Authority of the Emperour drew neceſſarily after it the motion of Arms.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Montenegro</hi> over-running the Country of <hi>Mantua,</hi> had attempted, though in vain, <hi>Caneto,</hi> and put a Garriſon into <hi>Caſtiglione</hi> to moleſt the Duke and threaten the Republick. And the Duke ſends his Troops by a generous and haſty Inrode to plunder in the <hi>Cremoneſe;</hi> but afterwards by better counſel, knowing it a vain thing to provoke with an appearance whom he could not ſuppreſs with force, recals them, and cauſes the Booty to be reſtored. He was now put to difficult and afflicting Councils; the Catholick Army was at his doors; the Imperial were near at hand, and ſuccours far off. Whereupon diſpatching <hi>Giovanni Franceſco Gonzagha,</hi> his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour Extraordinary, to <hi>Venice,</hi> he inſtantly deſires counſel and aſſiſtance. The Senate encouraged him to reſiſt with conſtancy all his troubles, and to comfort himſelf with hopes of better. They pleaded his Cauſe in every Court with reaſons, and did him all the ſervice they could, and till under the countenance of <hi>France</hi> they might declare themſelves, permitted all advantages to his Country, giving him paſſage for Men, Arms, and Victuals at a time that a great dearth, foretelling calamities to come, univerſally afflicted <hi>Italy;</hi> but the Duke found himſelf moleſted with new and always greater cares: For <hi>Naſſau</hi> being now arrived, requires him to deliver the Citadels of <hi>Caſale</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> that he might put Imperial Garriſons into them, and keep them together with the reſt, according to his Commiſſion; neither availed it, that <hi>Carlo</hi> endeavoured with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53750:150"/>
of ſubmiſſion and obedience to excuſe himſelf, offering alſo in token of greater reſpect to admit the Emperours Garriſon into ſome place of leſſer moment; whereupon the Commiſſary, excluding eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, and denying the term of twelve days, which the Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to adviſe with himſelf, obliges him to publiſh his Appeal to the Emperour, when he ſhould be better informed, and, if all paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were ſtopped there, to the Electors of the Empire. With this <hi>Naſſau</hi> returns to <hi>Milan,</hi> ſending from thence to <hi>Mantua</hi> frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations and proteſts, ſometimes avoided by the reſpect the Duke ſhewed, and then again preſſed upon his Declaration to defend himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Imperial Ban was nevertheleſs deferred by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> at the intreaty of his Wife, and by the offices of the Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany,</hi> who, but a Youth, having viſited the Pope, and received no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble entertainment at <hi>Venice,</hi> was gone to the Emperours Court. And it was indeed eaſier for the Duke to defend himſelf by Negotiation, than to maintain longer his Souldiers; for there having till now been maintained in the Territory of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſix thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot and thirteen hundred Horſe, pay at laſt failing, the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers diſbanded, and thoſe of the Country returned to their houſes. He then by the means of <hi>Ottaviano Vivaldini</hi> deſires money of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to keep his Troops on foot, and earneſtly implores, that to his, they would joyn five thouſand Foot and five hundred Horſe of their own, offering himſelf with that ſtrength to march to <hi>Caſale,</hi> and having ſecured that place, and in it preſerved <hi>Mantua</hi> alſo, to end the War with glory and expedition. <hi>Monſieur d'Avo</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Guron,</hi> the one Ambaſſadour for <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> and the other ſent expreſly into <hi>Italy</hi> for theſe Concerns, promiſed the entire aſſiſtance of the Crown, nay the perſon of the King himſelf, when the Siege of <hi>Rochel</hi> ſhould be ended, and demonſtrated withal, that if they in this interim, for want of aſſiſtance, ſhould let the Dukes Affairs periſh, and <hi>Caſal</hi> were loſt, all attempts and ſuccours after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards would be rendred vain.</p>
               <p>But the Senate apprehending the old aim of the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters to ingage the Republick in an open breach with <hi>Spain,</hi> to avoid that of their Crown, referred all reſolution to the arrival of the Kings Colours into <hi>Italy,</hi> to which they continued their promiſes to joyn themſelves. The Pope alſo concurred in the ſame opinion, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the <hi>French</hi> not to abandon <hi>Italy,</hi> and, in this interim ſending to the Emperour and both the Kings Nuntio's Extraordinary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour a Treaty of Peace, armed and fortified his Frontiers, plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in view of the <hi>Modeneſe,</hi> not without the complaints and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of that Duke, a good Fort which was called by his Name <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban.</hi> The hopes of <hi>Italy</hi> being then referred to the iſſue of the one affair of <hi>Rochel,</hi> which ſeemed now near an end, it plainly appeared, that as much as the <hi>Austrians</hi> had been advantaged by that Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo much the leſs were they to rejoyce at the taking of it. And the <hi>French</hi> began already highly to complain of the novelties and turbulencies raiſed in <hi>Italy;</hi> and, to ſupport the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:53750:151"/>
till they could ſend him greater Forces, they permitted him Levies and Supplies, giving him connivence and incouragement; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in his name and with money drawn from his Eſtate in that Kingdom were raiſed under the Marqueſs of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xelles</hi> twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe with ſix pieces of Cannon, to be tranſported from this ſide the Mountains to his aſſiſtance, ſeconded by ſome Troops of the Kings, commanded by the Mareſhal of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dauphiné.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Expedition, amplified alſo more than was neceſſary, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prompt diſpoſition of the Nation, wont to believe that done which ſeemed near to be executed, made them believe in <hi>France</hi> the Duke ready ſuccoured; and in <hi>Italy</hi> with great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fear was confounded with hope: for at the report, that that Army was drawing near, <hi>Gonzales</hi> imbarked his Cannon, and kept all ready to raiſe the Siege from <hi>Caſale;</hi> but at the ſame time, to divert the ſtorm from him, uſes all ſorts of ſubmiſſions and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and now <hi>Carlo</hi> believed himſelf arrived at that Poſt, which he had long propoſed to make himſelf Arbiter of the War and Peace of <hi>Italy:</hi> For the <hi>French</hi> alſo demanded paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of him with greater flatteries and ample offers of all ſorts of advantages, the Liberty and Wealth of the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> being the price, which to ſtrives was offered him by both the Crowns. But mindful of the offences done to <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and now fearful of his revenge, taking time to anſwer, the better to fortifie himſelf after having garriſoned his places, and obtained four thouſand Foot of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Milan,</hi> refuſes it. The <hi>French</hi> notwithſtanding reſolve by the way of <hi>Caſtel Delphino</hi> to attempt it; but the Duke being moved with his Army into the Valley of St. <hi>Pieter,</hi> and having cauſed the Prince <hi>Vittorio</hi> to advance, encountring the Vantguard in the Straights of thoſe Mountains, beats them and drives them back. All the Army then of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xelles</hi> retreats, and being come into <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> quickly diſbands; for a coolneſs ordinarily following the <hi>French</hi> fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Victuals were wanting, and the money, both managed with cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs and waſted with negligence, ſufficed not to ſupply it. In the beginning alſo of this Action, the <hi>Venetians</hi> being requeſted to permit paſſage to certain Cavalry of the Duke of <hi>Mantua's,</hi> that croſſing the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> they might move forward to joyn the <hi>French,</hi> refuſed it, becauſe in the difficulty to execute it, they could not diſcern ought but the wonted intentions to draw them unſeaſonably to Declarations and Ingagements. But the ſtraights of that Prince being now brought to that paſs, that he could no longer maintain his Court and Family, much leſs keep up his Army, they being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted in his Name by the Marqueſs of <hi>Pomar</hi> with expreſſions of pity rather than aſſiſtance, diſburſed to him twenty thouſand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats, and before the end of the year they ſupplied him with other and greater ſums for the maintaining of his Garriſons alſo. <hi>Carlo Emanuel</hi> having repulſed the <hi>French,</hi> triumphed greatly, and the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> was much more encouraged, who believing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the gain of <hi>Caſal</hi> ſecure, jealous leſt the Duke ſhould yet
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53750:151"/>
take in ſome part of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> which belonged to the King, ſends to <hi>Nizza</hi> with four thouſand Foot the Count <hi>John Serbellone,</hi> who took it in fifteen days, after having ſo frighted the Inhabitants with the ſpringing of a Mine, that they forced the Count of <hi>Agremont,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man, who defended it with twenty four of his Nation and ſome <hi>Monferrins,</hi> to capitulate and leave it. Of this diſtraction of Forces, which retarded the Siege, thoſe within <hi>Caſale</hi> made uſe to great advantage, reaping the harveſt, and bringing it into the Town, where was come in <hi>Monſieur de Guron,</hi> to animate in the Name of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Inhabitants and Garriſon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nuntio's,</hi> ſent from the Pope, being come to the Camp, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the midſt of theſe actions a ſuſpenſion of Arms for fifteen days, in which ſpace the <hi>Infanta Marguerita</hi> entring into <hi>Caſale,</hi> ſome Propoſition of agreement might be concerted. But the Governour jealous of ſome artifice of the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> to prolong his conqueſt by pretending, that together with his, there ſhould be put into it a Garriſon of the Emperours, diſſolves the Treaty. And the <hi>Grand Duke</hi> being returned from the Imperial Court had ſpeech in <hi>Mader<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> a place of pleaſure upon the <hi>Lago di Garda,</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and propoſed to him a change of thoſe States, ſince that the <hi>Monferrat,</hi> expoſed to the greedy deſires of the moſt powerful, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ſo great diſagreements; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not willing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an equivalent, that diſcourſe came to nothing. The Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then yielding to force, <hi>Gonzales,</hi> ſtrengthned with new Troops, ſtraightens <hi>Caſale,</hi> taking away at laſt the entry of Victuals and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours by the poſſeſſing of <hi>Ponzone, Roſſignano,</hi> St. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> and other Poſts on the Hill. The place nevertheleſs defended it ſelf with brave and frequent Sallies, in one of which <hi>Monſieur de Bevron,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man, being come in as a Voluntier, and having given proof of ſingular courage, was killed, and in another the Serjeant Major <hi>Luzzago,</hi> a <hi>Breſcian,</hi> ſeeing amongſt the Enemy the Traitor <hi>Spadino,</hi> ingaged himſelf ſo far to take off his head, that he there loſt his life. The Marqueſs <hi>Rivara</hi> obſerving, relief would be difficult and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and fearing that the conſumption of the Victuals in the Town would at laſt bring it to extremity, got ſtore into the Citadel, to maintain himſelf the longer there, exhorting the Inhabitants to ſtint Victuals; as they did with great proof of their conſtancy and fidelity. Nor did the beſiegers experience little leſs neceſſity; for <hi>Italy,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed this year by the Rivers, had given ſuch a ſlender harveſt of Corn, that Famine was an affliction every where, and eſpecially in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> whence that which could be taken ſerving for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though very ſcanty, to the Army, the people in the City of <hi>Milan</hi> periſhed. In <hi>Provence</hi> the <hi>French</hi> had reſtrained the liberty of tranſport.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſhut up the paſſage of the <hi>Po;</hi> and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> who alſo ſuffered very much, were careful that no grain ſhould paſs into the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi> So that the people being famiſhed, brake out into a kind of Tumult, which conſtrained the Governour to go thither and quiet it, and muſt have raiſed the Siege, if in that
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53750:152"/>
inſtant, from <hi>Sicily</hi> and elſewhere ſome Veſſels arriving in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Genoua,</hi> there had not been a ſupply ſeaſonable to the neceſſity. In the Imperial Court, to divert the Imperial Ban and the vigorous conſequences, which it uſes to carry with it, it was propoſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that in token of the Emperours Authority, to content <hi>Guaſtalla,</hi> ſome place of the <hi>Mantuan</hi> ſhould be delivered to him, and a ſuſpenſion of Arms be in the mean time in <hi>Monferrat,</hi> to treat ſome Accord with the <hi>Savoyards.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters accepting of no Propoſitions, perſwaded <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to new intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, carried to <hi>Mantua</hi> by Doctor <hi>Foppis,</hi> a Counſellor of the Court, that the Duke, within the ſpace of a month was to yield obedience to the Commiſſary. He always, to gain time and commiſeration, ſends the Prince his Eldeſt Son to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to ſhew his Duty to <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi> and to offer alſo, upon the obtaining the Inveſtiture of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to depoſite <hi>Caſal</hi> and the <hi>Monferrat</hi> into the hand of ſome Prince of confidence, to be kept in the Name and by a Garriſon of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours for a certain time, within which the cauſe ſhould be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; provided notwithſtanding that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> ſhould do the ſame in what they poſſeſſed. The Prince inſtead of being well received, which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour oppoſed even to proteſts, was ſcarce privately admitted; but although he carried back little advantage by the Journey, the Duke nevertheleſs got himſelf great applauſe by it, ſhewing, that having on his ſide omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing of his bounden duty towards the Emperour, on the other ſide was diſcovered the deſire and intention of the others; for it was anſwered, <hi>That</hi> Caſal <hi>being in the Emperours Name put into the Cuſtody of the</hi> Germans, <hi>which ſerved under the Enſigns of</hi> Spain, <hi>the Emperours will was, that the Governour ſhould keep what he poſſeſſed on the account of the pretenſions of</hi> Guaſtalla; <hi>and that the</hi> Savoyards <hi>ſhould keep what they held, in conſideration of their own Rights, till an Agreement or Sentence ſhould be declared, and then there ſhould be a ſuſpenſion in the</hi> Mantuan. From which was plainly diſcovered the deſign to put the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in poſſeſſion of <hi>Caſal,</hi> and deprive the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> of <hi>Monferrat;</hi> whereupon the Prince, denying to have power concerning that, departs; though the Empreſs had firſt given him counſel to lay the whole Concern at the Emperours foot, and receive Law from that Authority which he had no power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. Yet to give time to the <hi>French,</hi> that they might apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Duke not wholly breaking off the Negotiation, ſhews himſelf inclined to ſome kind of Exchange; and a Meeting in <hi>Piacenza</hi> to adjuſt it was negotiated by the Nuntio <hi>Scappi;</hi> but <hi>Cordua</hi> diſſents from it, alledging to have no power but to reduce <hi>Carlo</hi> to acknowledge reſpect due to the Emperour: at the ſame time notwithſtanding ſecretly propoſes to him great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, if he would deliver <hi>Caſal</hi> to himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Duke, to let it be known, that the actions of the Governor had had no other thing in aim but the zeal for the Emperours Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſends to the beſieged ſome Enſigns with Eagles in them, that being ſet up in the Caſtle, Citadel, and the City, they might
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53750:152"/>
procure reſpect to the Emperours Colours; but the Governour get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting notice of it, ſuffered them not to go in. Amidſt theſe Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Caſal</hi> holding out, though there being daily gained on the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s ſide, if not advantages, at leaſt hopes, arrives the news, which was ſo much longed for in <hi>Italy,</hi> that <hi>Rochel</hi> was at laſt taken.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England,</hi> to maintain it, had not failed to uſe his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt force, though, <hi>Buckingham</hi> being dead, much of that heat was quenched which inflamed the War; for having ſent a third Float under the Earl of <hi>Denby</hi> to its aſſiſtance, it made a new attempt to bring it in, but the <hi>French</hi> Ships making a brave oppoſition, the Dike was maintained againſt all attempts. The Sea afterwards ſwelling with a great tempeſt, diſperſed and diſordered the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, and and on the other ſide had ſuch reſpect to the Dike, as if it had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to the overthrow of the one and the glory of the other; the Tides, which in the month of <hi>July</hi> and about the Equinox were wont to be more than ordinarily violent and forcible, paſſed that year ſo calmly, that they did no hurt. <hi>Denby</hi> perceiving that he could not compaſs his purpoſe, making a Truce for a few days, to the end to retire with greater ſecurity, goes his way, and the <hi>Rochelois</hi> having ſpent their Victuals, and the uncleaneſt things now failing to ſatisfie hunger, ſeeing all hope of ſuccours and ſafety vaniſhed, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves at diſcretion upon the 29. of <hi>October.</hi> The place, to ſay truth, ſuffered during the Siege all that which by humane patience could be endured, or which in any former times may have been ſuggeſted by deſpair. The ſtreets covered with dead Carcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, made a ſhew rather of a Church-yard of bones unburied than of a City of living men; and thoſe few that were found alive, either languiſhed like men or almoſt like Skeletons, ſeemed no leſs to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Funerals of that proud City, than to ſignalize the Triumph of the Conquerours. The King cauſing it for two days to be clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the dead and ſick, made his ſolemn Entry the firſt of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> reſtoring the Divine Worſhip, and giving life and liberty to all, except the Mother and Siſter of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who by perſwaſions and example having prolonged the Surrender, he commanded to be kept in Arreſt, not ſo much for puniſhment as to have the means to bring the Duke more eaſily to obedience. He diſ-infranchiſed the City, demoliſhed the Walls, except on the ſide towards the Sea, leaving <hi>Rochel</hi> little elſe remarkable, but the memory of a ſtrong place, and the renown of a memorable Siege.</p>
               <p>True it is, that it was much conteſted in the Kings Council, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rochel,</hi> thus reduced, ought not to be kept with a ſtrong Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, as a bridle to the <hi>Huguenots</hi> and the repulſing of Strangers, and the Cardinal did not diſapprove it, as he aſpired to take the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and government of it; but diſcovering that the King, with whom he did not yet enjoy that abſolute power, which length of time and happineſs of ſucceſs afterwards gave him, had ſecretly promiſed it to <hi>Monſieur de Thoiras,</hi> he choſe rather to ſee the place razed to the ground than in the hands of another. Whereupon
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53750:153"/>
from the labouriouſneſs of the Siege recollecting the danger, which from the Commanders themſelves, if they ſhould revolt from the King, might happen of falling into the former evils, and ſhewing, that <hi>Brouage,</hi> which but a few Leagues off upon the Sea, he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be fortified for ſecurity of the Salt-pits, did plentifully ſupply the benefits pretended, he eaſily brought to paſs, that the pulling down the Walls was reputed the moſt remarkable Trophy and greateſt advantage of this Conqueſt. By this moſt happy iſſue of the enterpriſe, which had been believed by few, and was envied by many, the counſels of the Cardinal got more credit and eſteem, and the King publickly attributing the merit of it to him, heaped honours upon him, to ſuch a degree, that his Fortune, as a ſign from Heaven, was venerated as the deſtiny of the <hi>French,</hi> with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of greater Dignities, and was looked at by <hi>Italy</hi> as the <hi>Pole</hi> of their own hopes.</p>
               <p>The ſeaſon far advanced, furniſhed therefore thoſe of the Queen-mothers Faction, with pretexts conſiderable to reprove the thought of ſuccouring <hi>Caſal,</hi> and in particular the Kings going into <hi>Italy.</hi> The diſcourſes in the Council were; <hi>That the Army was wearied out, and the Souldiers in diſorder from the ſufferings in ſo long a Siege; That an unreaſonable Voyage was now propoſed, to traverſe the whole Kingdom, and to paſs over the narrow and ſteep paſſages of the</hi> Alps, <hi>ſubject to Treacheries, and diſputed by the Enemies Forces; That Winter was coming on; and how an Army could march, and the Cannon paſs through the Snow and over the Ice? The nature of thoſe craggie ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had at other times been overcome by Art, but now by the rigour of the ſeaſon Art it ſelf was overcome by Nature. The Forts, Arms, and Strengths of the</hi> Savoyards <hi>were to be conſidered, who, if with a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of men, they repulſed</hi> Uxelles <hi>in the Summer, how will they not ſhut the paſſage at preſent when all things contribute to their advantage? The Countries near to</hi> Italy <hi>were found to be infected with the plague. In</hi> Italy <hi>it ſelf the people periſh for want of bread. To what purpoſe then expoſe to hazard the Army that conquered</hi> Rochel, <hi>or rather the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of them that beat the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>not only to military Factions, but to Plague and Famine? That Souldiers who had overcome the Sea, repulſed the Enemy, and chaſtiſed the Rebels, deſerved other rewards, than to be carried beyond the Mountains to a Grave as the ſcraps of glory, and no leſs of obedience. That it was uncertain, whether</hi> Caſal <hi>could endure the length of ſuch a March, and if it ſhould yield to neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity whilſt the</hi> Alps <hi>were forcing, and the Army was getting into</hi> Italy, <hi>what way remained there more open for going forward, than that of a diſhonourable return? That it was therefore judged the moſt warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble counſel, ſince the ſeaſon neceſſitated the delay, to except the iſſue of things, ſound the minds of the Princes, and after reſolve upon the way either of Treaty or Arms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe conſiderations were added the complaints and tears of both the Queens; for <hi>Lewis</hi> having a feeling of ſome little indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, they exclaimed, that <hi>Richelieu,</hi> not content to have kept the King in the Mariſhes of <hi>Rochel</hi> and the unwholeſom Air of the Sea,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53750:153"/>
would now expoſe him to the colds and inconveniencies of the ſharpneſs of the <hi>Alps.</hi> Many were of opinion, that before ingaging the Forces elſewhere, it was fit to conclude a Peace with <hi>England,</hi> knowing alſo, that <hi>Rohan</hi> had an Army in <hi>Languedoc</hi> and ſome Towns, and that the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to encourage him, offered to enter into <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> and aſſiſtances were promiſed from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards;</hi> and to adjuſt them in the Name of <hi>Rohan</hi> himſelf, <hi>Monſieur de Clauſel</hi> going with the Abbot <hi>de Scaglia</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> had made an agreement with <hi>Olivares,</hi> that money being furniſhed him by that Crown, he, together with his Party, ſhould continue the War in <hi>France.</hi> And therefore <hi>Richelieu</hi> having often experienced, that in the attempt of great things Fortune made them ſucceed above expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation greater, inſinuated to the King the juſt motive to ſhew the <hi>Spaniards</hi> his reſentment of former injuries and the offences of a later date, by juſtly revenging himſelf for the aſſiſtance they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> by maintaining the juſt cauſe of a Prince in his own Kingdom, and by redeeming <hi>Italy</hi> from preſent oppreſſions, and thereby ſatisfying the perſwaſions of the Pope and the inſtances of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> His conſiderations were, <hi>That the difficulties which oppoſed the ſuccours, were the Mountains, the Seaſon, and the Enemy; but that nothing was invincible to the courage of the Nation, nothing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to the power, to the greatneſs, and felicity of a King ſo pious. That when he had once ſet foot in</hi> Italy, <hi>the affections and partialities of ſeveral Princes would be ſtirred up, and thoſe who under the yoke, for preſent fear, bemoan ſilently their condition, would be the firſt that with greedineſs would breathe liberty again and ſhake off the Chains: That the Forces of</hi> Carlo Emanuel <hi>were weak to make reſiſtance in ſo many ſituations and parts as there are paſſages, leading to the Mountains; and if the</hi> Spaniards <hi>would joyn to make oppoſition at the foot of the</hi> Alps, <hi>they would be forced to riſe from before</hi> Caſal. <hi>So that Fame and Glory being the fore-runners, the Victory would be without hazard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood, and without conteſt: But that nothing could be atchieved without the Royal Preſence, by reaſon of the Genius of the Nation, which, though it undertakes with heat, yet quickly grows cool, when the eye of the King does not quicken and inflame it: That it drew along with it the Guards, a People inured to War, and faithful, it attracted the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and valiant Gentry, preſerved Obedience and Diſcipline, made difficulties and wants be born, dangers be overcome, battels won, and impoſſibility it ſelf conquered, where the Perſon of the King diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courage from baſeneſs, and as a Companion in ſufferings and hazards, crowned true vertue with praiſe and reward. That the Peace with</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>was in great forwardneſs, nor could the</hi> Huguenots <hi>be better bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, but by drawing the Army near to</hi> Italy, <hi>that is to ſay, towards</hi> Languedoc, <hi>where is their greateſt ſtrength, and towards thoſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon which the</hi> Spaniards <hi>and</hi> Savoyards <hi>together have their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſigns. In ſum, ſo many conveniencies and advantages concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with it, as now forced a neceſſity to ſecond the counſels of reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King aſſented fully to the enterpriſe, and to attempt it in perſon; for having now taſted the glory of good ſucceſs, he aſpired
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53750:154"/>
to greater Triumphs, and had naturally a great averſion to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> and a greater deſire to keep them under. But the Cardinal not believing affairs yet in ſuch a condition, as to be able to come advantagiouſly to an open breach with them, inclined nevertheleſs to the reſolution of going into <hi>Italy,</hi> provoked by a violent deſire to revenge himſelf of <hi>Carlo Emanuel,</hi> and by intereſt to remove the King from <hi>Paris,</hi> the proper Seat for the Intrigues of the Court, and particularly of the Queens and their Faction, which could not be better extinguiſhed or weakened, but by keeping the King from thence, and amidſt the exerciſes of War have him under his ſole eye and hand. To notifie the action, <hi>Monſieur de la Salodie,</hi> as a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, was diſpatched into <hi>Italy,</hi> to incite the Princes to declare and unite themſelves, now the King was come near to the <hi>Alps</hi> with a puiſſant Army. Being arrived at <hi>Venice,</hi> he found in the Senate the readineſs he had always offered; extolling therefore the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of the King and the Prudence of his chief Miniſter, with an applauſe equal to the deſire with which they had ſollicited it, they wiſh a happy paſſage of the <hi>Alps,</hi> which being, they aſſure they will concur in the common deſigns, with the third part of thoſe Forces which the King ſhould judge neceſſary for the Action. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> imployed ſeveral Arts to divert this agreement, ſuggeſting by the moſt ſecret means to <hi>France,</hi> that the Republick aimed at nothing but to ingage it, and afterwards leave it alone in War with the <hi>Auſtrians:</hi> And to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that they ſhould remember what had paſſed in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and the old deſign of the <hi>French</hi> to bring them to a Rupture with <hi>Spain,</hi> without caring to ſecond it.</p>
               <p>But all attempts proving vain, <hi>Cordua</hi> was greatly perplexed: For if thoſe of <hi>Caſal,</hi> taking courage from the hopes of ſuccours near hand, ſhewed more than ever an obſtinate reſiſtance, his weakened Army did not admit of a joynt oppoſition with the <hi>Savoyards</hi> at the <hi>Alps,</hi> and to continue the Siege alſo. Beſides this, he knew and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the preſent ſtate of things; the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> expoſed, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects diſcontented, the Places unprovided, Victuals ſcarce, Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons conſumed, and Money wanting; for juſt in this year the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet under the Command of <hi>Peter Hein</hi> Admiral, advancing with a noble boldneſs into the <hi>American</hi> Seas, had near the Iſland of <hi>Cuba</hi> taken the Fleet compoſed of twenty Ships, which tranſported into <hi>Spain</hi> the Treaſures drawn from thoſe rich Kingdoms. Whereupon, after a Meeting in <hi>Pavia</hi> with <hi>Naſſau</hi> and <hi>Monterey,</hi> he had diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courriers in great diligence to <hi>Madrid</hi> for Orders and Supplies, and to <hi>Vienna</hi> for aſſiſtance and re-inforcement.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Spain</hi> nothing could arrive but ſlowly, and therefore his greateſt hopes were placed in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the power and good ſucceſs of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> greatly increaſing daily, there remained no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him to deſire more of Fortune. In this year <hi>Tilly</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in <hi>Verden</hi> and <hi>Stade;</hi> nor was there found ought elſe which could reſiſt, except ſome certain Iſlands ſecured by the Sea, or ſome few Towns, which having Ports, kept a way open for ſuccours. Whereupon <hi>Ferdinand</hi> taking courage to attempt higher matters,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53750:154"/>
inclines to make a reſtitution of Eccleſiaſtical Goods, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to get for the Archduke his Son the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Magde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> which had been conferred on <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſecond Son of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Saxe.</hi> But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> upholding his purpoſe with force, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the Cannons themſelves being fallen from their power, as having run themſelves into the delict of Treaſon by adhering to the Enemy, their Votes were illegitimate, and therefore the Election void.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frizland</hi> was deſigned to have paſſed into the Iſlands of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> if that Winter the freezing of the Sea, as is uſual, had afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a paſſage, or if Ships could have been provided for him, which, though he aſſumed the Title of General of the Sea, he had not been able to get, nor by any means to procure; and that in <hi>Lubeck</hi> the Count of <hi>Swartzenburg</hi> for the Emperour, and <hi>Gabriel le Roy</hi> for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> laboured all they could to perſwade thoſe maritime Towns to have furniſhed them. But he, deſirous at leaſt to poſſeſs himſelf of Ports, exerciſed the patience of the Duke of <hi>Pomerania</hi> with all ſort of offences, to the end to bring him to ſome deſperate reſolution, which might give him a pretext to deprive him of his Country. But that not ſucceeding, he beſieges <hi>Roſtock</hi> and <hi>Wiſmar, Anſeatick</hi> and Imperial Towns, with very conſiderable Havens, and having taken them without much ado, paſſing alſo into the Iſland of <hi>Rughen,</hi> prepares to ſtraighten <hi>Stralſond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to divert him, had poſſeſſed the Iſland of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſdom</hi> and the City of <hi>Wolgaſt</hi> in <hi>Pomerania.</hi> But <hi>Fridlandt,</hi> haſting thither with his wonted good Fortune, gave the King ſuch a defeat, as forced him to re-imbark and leave the City it ſelf as a prey to him. During this abſence of his, thoſe of <hi>Stralſond</hi> making a Sally upon a Fort placed over againſt their Town, took and demoliſhed it; wherewith provoked, he begirts it with a more ſtraight Siege, in ſuch ſort that being almoſt reduced to extremity, they capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by means of the Duke of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> to render it, when <hi>Frid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landt,</hi> ſecure of the event, goes his way to take poſſeſſion of the Dukedom of <hi>Mechelburg,</hi> which, the Emperour having deprived thoſe Princes for having taken part with <hi>Denmark,</hi> had given him, leaving the care to the Duke of <hi>Pomerania</hi> himſelf to receive the Surrender, and put a Garriſon into it.</p>
               <p>But the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who with happy ſucceſs made War in <hi>Livonia</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia</hi> with the <hi>Polaccks,</hi> underſtanding the extremity, in which for want of powder the City was, doubting, leſt having taken the Ports of the <hi>Baltick,</hi> the Imperialiſts might not only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due <hi>Denmark,</hi> but render themſelves terrible to himſelf and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, ſends an abundant Relief into it, with promiſe of greater aſſiſtance; whereupon the Inhabitants taking courage, breaking the Capitulation, perſiſted in their defence, which ſo much enraged <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain,</hi> that, if it were his cuſtom to make War with great cruelty, he now proteſted to make uſe of his Victory with all the exceſs of it. But in the brightneſs of ſo many proſperities, from <hi>Stralſond</hi> ariſes that little Cloud, which far out at Sea is wont, when it ſcarce appears, to
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53750:155"/>
burſt out ſuddenly into dreadful ſtorms. But the World, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not things to come, adored the Fortune of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and <hi>Italy</hi> in particular ballanced the hopes of the <hi>French</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours with the fears of an Inundation of the <hi>Germans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe important cares, the <hi>Venetians</hi> not neglecting the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Sea, infeſted by many Pirates, had armed two great Gallions under the Command of <hi>Giovanni Paulo Gradenigo,</hi> which in Company of two Galliaſſes, whereof <hi>Anthonio Cappello,</hi> called <hi>Terzo,</hi> was Captain, arrived at <hi>Aleſſandretta.</hi> There rode there at Anchor five <hi>French</hi> Ships, when as many <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pirates, coming in on a ſudden, ſet upon them with aſſured hopes to make them their prey. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> not being able in view of their own Colours to ſuffer the inſult, taking into protection the <hi>French,</hi> who were the weaker, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a hard Encounter made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be gone. The <hi>Turks</hi> were pleaſed with the defence of the Port, and the <hi>French</hi> with the ſafety of their Ships; the complaints which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made, being with reaſon quickly ſtilled. In <hi>Venice</hi> happened, afterwards ſome diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of minds for private intereſts, which, becauſe unuſual, deſerve to be taken notice of. They drew their original from diſguſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two <hi>Patrician</hi> Families, to wit, that of <hi>Cornaro,</hi> of <hi>Giovanni</hi> that was Duke, and that of <hi>Zeno di Renieri</hi> Cavalier. This laſt, a man of a haughty ſpirit, had in ſeveral occaſions inveighed againſt the other, and being one of the three Heads of the Council of Ten, had made uſe of the Authority of that Tribunal, to rebuke the Duke himſelf for ſuffering his Sons to run out into divers and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute liberties. At which <hi>Giorgio,</hi> on whom, it ſeemed, theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches reflected, falling into great fury, without his Fathers know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a Prince of ſingular piety and higheſt moderation, not far from the publick Palace ſets upon <hi>Zeno,</hi> when by night coming out of the Council of Ten he was come down the Stairs, and attempts with blows of Hatchets, followed by other Murderers, to kill him. Wounded in ſeveral parts, he was nevertheleſs preſerved alive; but the dignity of the Publick, the Council, eſteemed in the Common-wealth ſacred, and the liberty it ſelf of the Government remained violated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornaro</hi> by a quick Sentence was baniſhed by the Council of Ten with capital and grievous penalties, the Character of his Gentility was cancelled, and in the place of the offence a Memorial in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble erected in execration of the Fact. Whereupon Juſtice being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfied than mens minds quieted, <hi>Zeno</hi> being recovered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to inveigh often in publick Harangues againſt all the Family, and many adhering to the one and to the other, either for affection or kindred, it was evident, that mens minds grew imbittered in the diſcourſes of Aſſemblies and the Walks of the Market-place. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing then from private affections to publick affairs alſo, a deſire waxed big in many, that to the Authority of the Council of Ten, which is one of the ſupremeſt in the Republick, there might be ſome ſeaſonable regulation made; whereupon in the Election of perſons, whereof it is compoſed, wont to be renewed in the month
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53750:155"/>
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> almoſt all thoſe who were propoſed in the great Council met with excluſion. The moſt experienced Citizens apprehended danger from novelty, always prejudicial, when under the pretext of reformation change makes a forcible entry; the worſt of Moths, which if not killed at firſt, quickly deſtroys and corrodes the beſt ordered Governments. Nevertheleſs, it being neceſſary to give equal contentment to the major part, by the great Council were elected <hi>Niccolo Contarini, Anthonio da Ponte, Pietro Bondumieri, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta Nani,</hi> and <hi>Zacharia Sagredo</hi> as Reformers, to the end, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Authority of the Councils, and principally of that of Ten, they ſhould within a little time propound the Rules judged needful or convenient. There followed with full Votes for the Election of Secretaries, for the granting of ſafe Conducts, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other things of no great moment, ſeveral Conſultations, amongſt which the chief was the abolition of the Authority, which by the ancient Laws were given it, to revoke the Decrees of the great Council it ſelf, where, as is uſual in things moſt important, they were not bound up to particular Conditions and the ſtrictneſs of Votes. There was alſo propoſed by the Reformers the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Authority which belonged to the Council of Ten, with the enumeration of many caſes, and with the power to be the ſole Judge of the <hi>Patricians</hi> in criminal Cauſes active and paſſive, with a choice nevertheleſs to commit to other Magiſtrates thoſe which were of leſſer moment. The conteſt hereupon was very ſore, becauſe it was the very thing wherein many deſired an alteration, it appearing too ſtrange, that even in the moſt trivial caſes, the Nobles alone ſhould be ſubject to the moſt ſevere Judicature, where the way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is by Inquiſition, with ſecrecy and a certain rigour which they call the Cuſtom. But our wiſe Anceſtors knowing, that the chief bond of <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> is the chaſtity and moderation of that part which governs, have been willing to put a bridle upon it, becauſe from betwixt Rule and Licence there would be too ſhort a diſtance, if the Authority of the Laws and the ſeverity of Judgments did not interpoſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt day it was propoſed, no Decree paſſed in the Great Council, but the Votes and Inclinations fully tended to reject it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken into debate, another day it was ſharply ſpoken againſt by <hi>Renieri Zeno</hi> Cavalier, and defended by <hi>Niccolo Contarini;</hi> but <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco Contarini,</hi> Head of the Council of the <hi>Quaranta Criminali,</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the oppoſite Party with an eloquent diſcourſe, ſo moved the minds of the major part, that many not keeping ſilence, prevented the Votes with their cryes, when <hi>Baptiſta Nani</hi> beginning to ſpeak, making ſilence by the authority of what he was going to ſay, and by his gray hairs and the gravity of his behaviour giving credit to his reaſons and diſcourſe, thus ſpake; <hi>It is no new thing to me, that he is more applauded and acceptable, who ſpeaks to the liking of others, than for the publick Good: But liberty in Councils, truth in judging, and courage in difficulties ſhall never abandon me. The itch of inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ambition diſquiets me not; the common hope of Honours diſturbs
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53750:156"/>
me not; nor am I moved with the deſire of applauſe. Conſtant in the adverſity of my Country, I fear nothing; moderate in its proſperity, I gain nothing. I look up to no other</hi> Pole, <hi>nor have other ſcope than that which hath been preſcribed by our Anceſtors, always venerable from the duration of the Country. We are all ſtrictly bound to this duty, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unviolable and unextinguiſhed that light of Glory and Liberty, which our Fathers have ſo many Ages ago conſigned to us. I know, that man hath no office ſavouring more of Divinity than that of governing others; but it is a thing of great difficulty, and if ſuch be the government over inferiours, how much more hard will it be to command over equals? But this is our glory, that Majeſty and Obedience take their turns; that we are equally capable to govern and to be governed, that to the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dignity of Command is aſſociated the vertuous moderation of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life and the moſt eaſie yoke of the Laws. So that our Republick is ordered like the Heaven, in which the Citizens, in reſemblance to the Stars, have, by office in the univerſal felicity, influence and light, but with various Situations, divers Aſpects, and different Motions, enjoying ſometimes a fulneſs of light, lending it often to others, and then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuffering an Eclipſe. Ought we then to accuſe the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, becauſe it hath not diſtributed to all the ſame offices and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Shall we then alſo in our Country where</hi> Ten <hi>make a ſupreme Council, which by annual change give place to the merits of others, ſtir our ſelves up to envy and anger, becauſe we all cannot be capable of it at once? I dread to think, that there is any that deteſts the rigour of Juſtice, the ſeverity of the Laws, and the Authority of the Council of</hi> Ten. <hi>Let us in this caſe then ſuppoſe our ſelves guilty from our ſelves, and to offend without puniſhment; will we quite aboliſh Juſtice and Government it ſelf? Let us, I pray, turn theſe invectives againſt the offences, let us abhor the Delinquents, let us make Decrees againſt faults, and on the contrary, let us venerate that Ray of Divinity, which, though it ſtrike the wicked with Thunder, is a guide to the innocent. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the antiquity of ſuch a Council always venerable, and the Ages by which its Authority hath been eſtabliſhed; a Council choſen by our ſelves, compoſed of our ſelves, is the Maintainer of the Laws, the Protection of Liberty, and the Bridle of Subjects. But what ſhall become of us and our Poſterity, if wanting the ſacred refuge of our defence, we ſhall think to offend without puniſhment, and be audaciouſly deſpiſed? What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects the Dignity of Perſons and of Families, the ſecurity of quiet and civil living, the liberty it ſelf of the Government, but the Council of</hi> Ten <hi>alone, which ſharply puniſhing offences, reſtrains with their Name and Authority the thoughts alſo of attempting them. We by weakening it and expoſing it to contempt, think by it to diminiſh puniſhment, and by it provoke injuries. Do any perhaps, under the pretext of regulating abuſes, go about to abaſe the Power of the Government? A ſad deſign, which betrays to himſelf and his poſterity the hopes of thoſe rewards, which the Country with conſiderable dignity largely imparts. Let ſuch go out from amongst us, let them not be eſteemed worthy to be Sons of ſo great a Common-wealth, and he that would withdraw himſelf from the Laws and from puniſhments, contriving rather to make himſelf a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:53750:156"/>
than aſpiring to be a Judge, like a Monſter of Vice,</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">An. Dom. </seg>1629</label> 
                  <hi>let him be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from us and cut off. In our Republick this is the juſt equality not to do and not to ſuffer wrongs. Away with ſuch conceits, that thoſe in Power ought to have a greater liberty, and that puniſhments on Delinquents can be either too heavy, or judgments too ſevere. This is the bond of our quiet and the quiet of our Subjects. Some Law givers have omitted to mention puniſhments for certain outragious faults, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that they could never happen in a well ordered Government. Our Anceſtors on the other ſide have been willing even in ſmall matters to aſſign a more ſevere judgment, to the end that not ſo much as the leaſt offences ſhould give encouragement of coming near to diſcompoſe the good order and integrity of the Common-wealth. Happy the Country, moſt happy the People, and the Government to be admired, which hath for its Foundation Law, and for its Crown Liberty; where thoſe of the better ſort excel in example, where he finds more reſtraint that enjoys greater authority. Fathers, in point of Renown we have no cauſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy any of the ancient States or modern Soveraignties. In the largeneſs of ovr Dominion, we have wherewithal to content the moderation of our minds. In the duration of liberty we ſurpaſs any Common-wealth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. But the deliberation of this day is to overcome our ſelves; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we give comfort to our Subjects, example to Strangers, and occaſion for a good Report. Let the</hi> Venetian <hi>Nobility, all in a body, in the moſt majeſtical and authoritative of their Aſſemblies unanimouſly determine, that if Empire and liberty at one and the ſame birth be acknowledged from God, they willingly conſecrate themſelves to Juſtice, and will go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the people with ſuch moderation and ſweetneſs, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of offences, they make choice for their Court of Juſtice, of the graveſt, for Laws, the ſevereſt, and for puniſhments, the heavieſt.</hi> Upon theſe or like words, delivered with gravity, and received with great attention, opinions and minds were ſo changed, that many bluſhing that they had thought otherwiſe, the Decree with a great number of Votes was willingly embraced, and two days after followed the Election of Perſons propoſed, for the new Council of Ten, amongſt which with great applauſe <hi>Nani</hi> was received, and what had paſſed was regiſtred in the publick Records with an honourable memory of his Name.</p>

                  <hi>Italy</hi> expecting ſuccours from the <hi>Alps,</hi> and by ſuccours ſafety, <hi>Lewis</hi> arrives there with thirty thouſand men, having left his Mother Regent at <hi>Paris.</hi> But before the King moved, <hi>Luigi Contarini,</hi> the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Venice,</hi> had gotten a promiſe from the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he would not interrupt the enterpriſe; and a while after the Peace was concluded, which, by the death of <hi>Buckingham</hi> the private paſſions of Favourities being extinguiſhed, conſiſted in few Articles; <hi>To renew the ancient Treaties, restore Commerce, ſilence reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally pretenſions about Repriſals, prevent them for the future, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Conditions of the Marriage, if any difficulty ſhould intervene amicably to agree it.</hi> Each King reſerved himſelf the liberty to aſſiſt
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:53750:157"/>
his Allies without breach of the Peace. The Copies of the Treaty, till the Ratification, were depoſited in the hands of the Miniſters of the Republick, who by the Mediation had gotten great reputation, eſpecially <hi>Contarini,</hi> who within a while paſſed to the Embaſſy in Ordinary of <hi>France.</hi> The King then freed from that diſtraction marches towards <hi>Italy,</hi> having firſt ſent to <hi>Mantua Monſieur de Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> to carry the News of it to the Duke, at a time very ſeaſonable, when the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> aſſaulted him with ſecret promiſes, and <hi>Naſſau</hi> pinched hard upon him, who, being gone againſt <hi>Mantua,</hi> and requiring a poſitive declaration of obedience or reſiſtance, while the Duke, fenced with general conceptions, denounced to him War and Force. To the noiſe hereof, the effects afterwards fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, the Emperour orders, to pleaſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the march of the <hi>French,</hi> that his Army ſhould deſcend into <hi>Italy.</hi> The Duke hereupon in trouble betwixt the hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours and the fear of dangers, equally near, ſending <hi>Pomar</hi> again to <hi>Venice,</hi> ſollicites, together with the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, the Republick to declare it ſelf and aſſiſt him with a body of their men, that, while the King forced the <hi>Alps,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> with the Fleet would endeavour landing, ſo to ſend ſuccours to <hi>Caſal,</hi> they might paſs into, or attacque the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> from this other ſide, for the aſſiſtance of one another either by diverſion or conjunction of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It appearing to the Senate, that the ſtrength of the Army by Sea did not anſwer the fame of it, and many difficulties diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, which might be met with at the <hi>Alps,</hi> the Council thought it more wiſe to ſtay till the King ſhould be in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> But to the end the Duke might be able to maintain his Troops, they furniſh him with ſeventy thouſand Ducats, and, to have all in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſecond the Kings undertaking, order General <hi>Erizzo</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Army into ſuch Quarters, that it might be quickly drawn together to give countenance to the Duke, and jealouſie to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe,</hi> when the occaſion ſhould require it. Nine thouſand Foot and a thouſand Horſe being thus diſtributed on the Frontiers, gave great jealouſie to the Governour, who, to ſend a body to that ſide, ſo weakened himſelf in the Camp, that he was ſcarce able to ſupply wherewith to keep his Poſts and Guards in the Trenches.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> kept together five thouſand Souldiers in pay, but with great difficulty, by reaſon of the continual want where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was of money; ſo that, to pleaſe them with ſome advantage, and entertain them with booty, he ſent them into the <hi>Cremoneſe</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Caſal Maggiore,</hi> a Town rich and great, kept by eight hundred men of the Country, who frighted at the approach of the <hi>Mantuans,</hi> left it them in prey, ſcarce ſaving the Cannon by Water. It was thereupon expoſed to Pillage, and afterwards abandoned. <hi>Sabione<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> as hath been ſaid elſewhere, was poſſeſſed by a Princeſs of the Houſe of <hi>Stigliana,</hi> who not believing it ſecure from the Forces of the Borderers, had truſted it to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who kept it with a great Garriſon and exceeding much care, as a pledge recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to his truſt by all <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Spaniard</hi> had ſeveral times
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53750:157"/>
in this Conjuncture deſired of him to permit the entrance of a body of their men, to trouble the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> and the Neighbours. But finding no forwardneſs in the Duke, they applied themſelves to Craft, cauſing <hi>Naſſau</hi> to enter into it, admitted by the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Vitale,</hi> the Governour, out of reſpect to the Imperial Name of the Emperor; and at the ſame time they perſwaded the Prince <hi>Buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zolo,</hi> who had great pretenſions upon the place, to draw near to it, giving him hopes that the Gates, by means of the Imperial Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, ſhould be opened to him. But the Governour perceiving the deſign, the Prince found the defence in ſuch ſort ordered, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other attempt he retires, and <hi>Naſſau</hi> thought it beſt to be gone. It was moreover believed, that the advertiſement to the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> of the deſign of <hi>Buzzolo</hi> came from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, to induce him with the apprehenſions of ſo many dangers to call them to a part of the cuſtody and defence of it. But he rather ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens it, and <hi>Buzzolo,</hi> having recourſe to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that they might give him means to attempt the ſurpriſe of it, was diſſwaded by them, both by the difficulty which would ariſe in exploiting of it, and by the unſeaſonableneſs to draw ſtirs into thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Lewis,</hi> to facilitate his paſſage of the Mountains, made a new attempt to overcome the mind of <hi>Carlo Emanuel,</hi> offering to add to twelve, other thirty thouſand Crowns of yearly Rent for his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and inviting him to the enterpriſe of <hi>Genoua</hi> with the flatteries of greater advantages. Whereupon the Duke taking a meaſure of the Genius of the Cardinal, whom from the deſire of revenge he judged to be brought in ſo cold a ſeaſon towards <hi>Italy,</hi> thought it too dangerous to draw under the title of Friendſhip ſo brave an Army into the bowels of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> with the preſence of the King and of a Miniſter maliciouſly affected. He had his confidence in the ſeaſon of the Winter, in the nature of the Situations, in his own Forces, in the Succours of <hi>Spain,</hi> and in the Motions of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots;</hi> whence he doubted not of Courage to promote the good, and Art to extricate himſelf out of all Fortune. He was become crafty above any other in ſelling himſelf at a dear rate at a time of need, and was wont always, even to his Friends, to make ſhew of neceſſity; but at this very time, to keep all right, he received from the Governour all that he deviſed to aſk. He reſolved to ſend him three thouſand Souldiers, which was the moſt he could do, not having been willing to weaken his Forces on the Confines of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> or be diverted from ſtrengthening the maritime Garriſons for fear of the Army by Sea, though it appeared not, becauſe the Souldiers appointed for it were called to greaten that by Land. So that he remained before <hi>Caſal</hi> with only two thouſand Souldiers in pay, and four thouſand of the Country; whereupon he ſollicites the Princes obliged to ſend their Proportions for the defence of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> but they all excuſed themſelves, it ſeeming that in ſome, at the appearing of the <hi>French</hi> Army, the ancient reſpect to <hi>Spain</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed together with the preſent fear. On the other ſide the <hi>French</hi> preſſed, that the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> would now be aſſiſting to their
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53750:158"/>
own ſafety, by joyning themſelves to their Crown.</p>
               <p>But the Pope perceiving the intention to oppoſe the <hi>Austrians,</hi> now he ſaw the <hi>French</hi> Colours on the Border of <hi>Italy,</hi> refuſed to depart from Neutrality, and had appointed for Legate <hi>à Latere</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Anthonio,</hi> his Nephew, for the negotiating of a Peace. The <hi>Venetians</hi> judging, that the coming of the King did not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently remedy the neceſſity, by reaſon of the coming down of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and that <hi>Mantua</hi> was ſo begirt, that it could not receive ſuccours from <hi>France,</hi> conſented to under-write a League with <hi>France</hi> and with the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> which being to laſt for ſeven years for the removing of preſent dangers, and eſtabliſhing Peace, obliged the Confederates to ſuccour one another reciprocally in caſe of Invaſion; The King with twenty thouſand Foot and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, the Republick with twelve thouſand of the one and a thouſand and two hundred of the other, and the Duke with five thouſand of the firſt and five hundred of the laſt. In proportion to the Forces the Conqueſts were to be divided, if from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive they ſhould be forced to attacque. Jealouſies were not wanting, even when it was ready to be ſigned: For the Voyage of <hi>Monſieur de Botru,</hi> a Confident of the Cardinals, to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> under a pretext to propoſe Expedients for the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> but in truth to diſcover the intentions of <hi>Olivares</hi> and the Treaties which he had with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> kept the <hi>Venetians</hi> a while in ſuſpence; but the ſuſpicions quickly vaniſhing, they ſent <hi>Girolamo Soranzo</hi> Cavalier, Procurator, Ambaſſadour Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he might congratulate the Kings Arrival in <hi>Italy,</hi> move him to advance, and aſſure him of their conſtant adhering to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of that Crown. Being forced to take a long way about, (for that the paſſages were almoſt all ſhut) the Secretary <hi>Girolamo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vazza</hi> went before by the way of <hi>Genoua</hi> and of the Sea, though in paſſing near <hi>Monaco</hi> he was by a <hi>Brigantine</hi> of that Prince arreſted Priſoner, and in the Town brought to the Marqueſs of <hi>Castagneda, Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour in <hi>Genoua,</hi> who was accidentally there; but being known for a Miniſter of the Republick, and no Diſpatches found, which he had torn and flung into the Sea, he was releaſed. The King being come to <hi>Orſo,</hi> an inconſiderable Village at the foot of the <hi>Alps,</hi> filled <hi>Italy</hi> with the Name and Glory of his Arms. But the Paſs thereabout was ſtopped by the <hi>Savoyards</hi> with three Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does; and three Redoubts together with the Fort of <hi>Gelaſſé,</hi> placed on a Rock, battered the way. A little further, where the Valley opens it ſelf, which points out to Strangers the broadeſt way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into <hi>Italy,</hi> ſtands <hi>Suſa,</hi> fortified with a good Citadel, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle forwards, thoſe ſteep Mountains declining into Hillocks, lies <hi>Avigliana,</hi> as the Guard of the adjacent Plain, and which at that time was provided with a numerous Garriſon. The three thouſand men of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> commanded by <hi>Marco Anthonio Belloni, Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monteſe,</hi> had the Guard of the places moſt advanced and expoſed. The Duke had not been able to ſtop the <hi>French</hi> Army, though he ſent to the King the Prince <hi>Vittorio,</hi> who as a Kinſman might carry
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53750:158"/>
him the teſtimonies of a greater confidence; for the King referring all to the Cardinal, and he, ſhewing an inſuperable conſtancy in not admitting any proffer, which carried not a ſecure Warranty of faithful dealing, fruſtrated all attempts and endeavours. Treaty then being at an end, the <hi>French,</hi> (the King preſent) attacque the Barricadoes with that force of theirs which hath no reſiſtance, and poſſeſſed them with the Forts and Redoubts, lodging all at once in <hi>Suſa,</hi> and inveſting the Citadel. The Duke greatly perplexed at this blow, diſpatches again his Son with more ample powers and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inſtructions to conclude upon any Terms. The <hi>French</hi> had not a mind, altogether free from the cares of the Kingdom, nor had at this time other aim but to mortifie the Duke and preſerve <hi>Caſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon <hi>Richelieu</hi> having in part obtained his purpoſe, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Suſa</hi> with the Prince; <hi>That for the Kings Troops, in their going to</hi> Caſal <hi>and return thence, Victuals and Quarters ſhould be furniſhed by the Duke; that at the Charge of</hi> France, <hi>but with Corn of</hi> Piedmont, <hi>the Town ſhould be provided by the Duke himſelf; that in Hostage the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of</hi> Suſa <hi>and the Fort of</hi> Galaſſé <hi>ſhould be delivered, to be kept by a Garriſon of</hi> Switzers; <hi>and if afterwards</hi> Cordua <hi>ſhould voluntarily raiſe the Siege, the King conſented, that</hi> Nizza <hi>ſhould by</hi> Switzers, <hi>in the Name of the Emperour, be kept for a month, after which time it ſhould be delivered to the Duke of</hi> Mantua, <hi>although he were not yet inveſted by</hi> Ferdinand. <hi>Certain weeks were aſſigned the</hi> Spaniards <hi>to ratifie the Treaty, and not accepting it, the Duke promiſed to joyn his Troops to the Kings, to invade the</hi> Milaneſe, <hi>in retribution whereof, and upon the account of his pretenſions, there were to be given him, together with</hi> Trino, <hi>a Revenue of fifteen thouſand Crowns in</hi> Monferrat.</p>
               <p>The Duke approves every thing, and to ratifie the Treaty with pledges of greater confidence, comes to <hi>Suſa</hi> much ſatisfied, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for the preſent his Country from an Inundation, and perhaps alſo to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from taking <hi>Caſal,</hi> with aſſured hopes, that ſuch accidents muſt quickly happen, which would not only prove favourable to him to retain what he poſſeſſed, but to recover <hi>Suſa,</hi> and carry on his advantages yet further. The Cardinal on the other ſide rejoyced, he had obliged <hi>Cordua</hi> to riſe at the Name and Reputation only of the <hi>French</hi> Arms, ſuccouring without any hazard and ingagement the place beſieged. It appearing beſides to him, as if he had flattered the vanity and inconſtancy of the Duke, his further thoughts were to make uſe of theſe Forces and of the Conjuncture to give the <hi>Huguenots</hi> the laſt ſhake, before that from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> or elſewhere they could receive aſſiſtance. In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the two Contractors had no other aim but to gain time, little intending to perform the things promiſed. But <hi>Italy</hi> not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo ſoon what was before them, the unlooked for News of the Agreement of <hi>Suſa</hi> brought great amazement.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> were now ready to invade the <hi>Milaneſe;</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving underſtood, the King had forced the paſſage of the Mountains, they had at the ſollicitation of the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters ordered their General to joyn the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to attempt diverſions and ſuch
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53750:159"/>
enterpriſes, as they according to the occaſion ſhould find fit. <hi>Erizzo</hi> then having ſpoken with the Duke in <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> and knowing it impoſſible to paſs to <hi>Caſal</hi> through the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> with a Journey of more than a hundred miles, amidſt ſo many Towns and with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Rivers between, reſolves, leaving <hi>Candales</hi> with a body of men about <hi>Crema</hi> to alarm the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Confines, to joyn the Duke in <hi>Oſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano,</hi> and from thence to invade the <hi>Cremoneſe</hi> with eight thouſand &amp; five hundred Foot and fifteen hundred Horſe of the Republicks, and with five thouſand five hundred Foot and twelve hundred Horſe of the Dukes. The Army juſt marching was obliged to halt, by the advice which was come to <hi>Milan</hi> of the Treaty of <hi>Suſa.</hi> It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves had under-hand contrived it to be brought to <hi>Pietro Anthonio Marioni</hi> Reſident for the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, expreſly to divert Invaſion on that ſide, which by reaſon of the ſmall Forces which they had there was an exceeding trouble to them. But concerning the Treaty, the <hi>Venetians</hi> remained diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to extremity, not ſo much becauſe <hi>Monſieur d'Avo,</hi> to perſwade them to the march, had aſſured them of the contrary, as becauſe <hi>Caſal</hi> ſeemed not preſerved but for a ſhort time; whence foreſeeing, that when the King ſhould be retired, and the Army diminiſhed, the attempts would be re-aſſumed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the evil being prolonged rather than cured, time was given to the <hi>Germans</hi> to come into <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> complained alſo, that under the favour of an Army ſo powerful, inſtead of the Succours he hoped for, he was to receive the greateſt damage, whilſt <hi>Trin</hi> and a great part of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat</hi> was given to <hi>Savoy.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> alledged the preſervation of <hi>Caſal</hi> as meritorious, and the neceſſity of not retarding the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours as an excuſe, underſtanding the place was reduced to ſuch extremity, that the Army would not have been able to arrive in time, if they muſt have been forced to make their way with the Sword. In effect, <hi>Gonzales</hi> drew off from the Siege ſo ſoon as he heard of the Treaty, and with the Troops firſt advanced to <hi>Fraſſinetto</hi> retired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> raging openly, that a certain prey had been taken out of his hand by the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> but rejoyced in his heart, that if the Capitulation of <hi>Suſa</hi> ſaved <hi>Caſal,</hi> it preſerved alſo the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> at that time expoſed by the weakneſs of Forces, if it had been invaded, to a moſt certain ruine. <hi>Caſal</hi> was preſently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with fifteen thouſand Sacks of Corn, brought in by the <hi>French,</hi> and by others furniſhed by the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to whom the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> gave for that purpoſe thirty thouſand Ducats, beſides another ſum, to keep his Souldiers in order with ſome ſmall pay. Into the Town were put a good number of <hi>French</hi> under <hi>Monſieur de Thoiras, Mareſchal de Camp,</hi> taking their paſſage through <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and ſome were brought into <hi>Aqui</hi> and <hi>Nizza,</hi> whence the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were gone out. The diſpleaſure at their being brought in, more than the ſhame for the retreat, vexed extremely <hi>Gonzales,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> arriving happily there, whence with ſo much noiſe of Councils and Arms the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had endeavoured to keep them far off, and his jealouſie
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53750:159"/>
was ſo much the more increaſed, when he underſtood, that Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a Capucin, moſt confident with the Cardinal, was going to <hi>Mantua</hi> to propoſe amidſt many pretexts to the Duke, that, to ſpare care and troubles, he would yield <hi>Monferrat</hi> to the Crown, which ſhould give him a Soveraignty in exchange near to the Eſtate he poſſeſſed in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo</hi> from theſe dealings had occaſion to know, that the ſuccours of great Princes are ſeldom done without reſpect to their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and underſtanding at what the <hi>French</hi> aimed, he thought it good counſel, if he could poſſibly bring it to paſs, to diſ-ingage himſelf as ſoon as he could, by aſſenting to the Treaty of <hi>Suſa,</hi> as well from the aſſiſtance of the one, as the Hoſtility of the other Crown. Dextrouſly therefore rejecting the Propoſitions of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucin, he ſends the Marqueſs <hi>Striggio</hi> to give the King thanks for his ſuccours, and together with ample powers to execute the Treaty. But although there was a Meeting upon it of Deputies in <hi>Buzzolino,</hi> a Town near to <hi>Suſa,</hi> and that the <hi>Mantuans</hi> offered to the <hi>Savoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> the choice of Lordſhips divided into four Ranks; yet <hi>Carlo Emanuel,</hi> who thought of any thing but obſerving the accord, firſt by ſeveral excuſes, and after by the ſupervening of new accidents, fruſtrates the buſineſs. The Ambaſſadour <hi>Soranzo</hi> being arrived at <hi>Suſa,</hi> and finding the Agreement concluded, though he could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the prejudices which were apprehended by the Republick, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured at laſt, that the execution might be warily provided for, by deferring the departure of the King and the Army till Ratifications ſhould arrive from <hi>Spain.</hi> His conſiderations to the King and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal were; <hi>That Peace was not well grounded upon words alone and promiſes, in an Age, in which fraud paſſes for expedience, and infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is reckoned amongst advantages; but that ſecurity conſiſted in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling and effectuating Agreements. That fear of that unconquered Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had extorted from the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>a Conſent. Fame, the fore-runner of the Glory of ſo generous a Monarch, had forced the Governour of</hi> Milan <hi>from</hi> Caſal. <hi>But that agreements dictated from neceſſity, as by an unjuſt and violent Miniſter, have always been obſerved to be of ſhort continuance. If that troubleſom and inconſtant ſpirit of the Duke be thought to be ſufficiently fixed, it were but reaſon to looſen the bond of Force. If the will of</hi> Gonzales <hi>be thought changed, or the Maxims of the Councils of</hi> Spain <hi>moderated, he for his part conſented that the thought of Arms ſhould be laid aſide. But if in the one, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the affront, an ambitious heart be diſcovered, and in the other, vexed to the purpoſe with ſhame, a haughty mind, and in both the gnawing deſire of Ambition and Empire be invited from difficulty; a falſe ſecurity would delude the mind of ſo great a King, and ſcorn the counſel of his wiſe Miniſter. That Glory was a Plant, which endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red load and weight upon it ſelf; but if abandoned to the offences of time, and the injuries of men, naked and torn, though at firſt adored, within a while it would be deſpiſed. That from the</hi> Alps <hi>the proſperous name of the Crown of</hi> France <hi>reſounded through</hi> Italy; <hi>but if ſo ſoon as arrived it diſappears, its friends would within a while ſeek for prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>

two Archbiſhopricks, twelve Biſhopricks, and a great number of Abbies and rich Monaſteries, to the ſo great commotion of the Hereticks, that <hi>Saxe</hi> with all his Party highly complained of it, and denied that ſuch Authority was due to the Emperour alone without a Diet and the conſent of the States of the Empire. But flattered with a crafty promiſe, that the reſtitution ſhould not be preſſed but in a judiciary and civil way, he within a while perceives that the Generals of the Armies were deputed for the execution of it, who confounding the doubtful with the certain, filled the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire with alteration, and the Princes with loſſes and complaints. The contrivance ſeemed of moment, becauſe the beſt Pieces and the Churches which had Principalities annexed, were to be incorporated into the Sons and Family; the reſt, to promote the Reformation of Religion, were with vaſt riches to be given by the Emperour to the Jeſuits now exalted, and believed the Authors of this Decree, which, conſidering the condition of the times, even to the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſeemed unſeaſonable.</p>
               <p>Deſigns ſtopping not here, he ſends General <hi>Arnhein</hi> into <hi>Pruſſia</hi> with an Army in favour of the <hi>Polacks,</hi> not ſo much in a thankful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of the ſuccours in the greateſt preſſure of his neceſſities, obtained from King <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> as to keep the King of <hi>Swede</hi> intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in thoſe parts. But the effect was very differing from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; for the <hi>Polacks,</hi> having a natural diſtruſt of Strangers, and in particular deteſting the <hi>Germans,</hi> ſo ſoon as under the warmth of this aſſiſtance they began to breathe with ſome proſperity, obliged their King to make a Truce for ſix years. Whereupon <hi>Guſtavus</hi> began to ruminate in his vaſt mind upon vaſt thoughts, and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or deſirous to prevent the injuries he feared, lent his ear to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny invitations, which in the name of Princes diſcontented and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viers of the <hi>Austrians</hi> were brought to him; and to lay the grounds of ſome Intelligences and Agreement, he ſent ſecretly to divers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>Wolmar</hi> Count of <hi>Faremsback.</hi> But in <hi>Holland, England,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> he found as then rather a hearing than reflecting upon this Propoſition of moving Arms againſt <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> whilſt the late Wars in <hi>Poland,</hi> with the felicity of ſucceſſes, had rather gotten the King the reputation of wiſe and valiant, than renown to the Kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by all no leſs poor than remote, and by conſequence too weak to grapple with the Fortune and Power of the <hi>Austrians,</hi> now grown to a full age and well rooted.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who deſpiſed nought that was profitable and great, reſolves to ſend ſecretly Miniſters to ſound better the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and Power of the King and the diſpoſition of the Princes of the Empire. <hi>Faremsback,</hi> being by by-ways got into <hi>Italy,</hi> and come to <hi>Mantua</hi> about the time of the Arrival of the <hi>Germans,</hi> obſerved the Dukes great fear, and offered him diverſion in <hi>Germany,</hi> when with ready money he ſhould give motion and means to the good diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his King, richer in Courage and Iron than in Strength and Gold. At laſt diſcovering the Duke in a condition rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive than give aſſiſtance, he paſſes to <hi>Venice</hi> with Letters Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; but demands nothing but the convenience of a Galley to go

into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> his way lying to <hi>Buda,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania</hi> to <hi>Ragotzi,</hi> ſucceeded to <hi>Gabor</hi> deceaſed, to ſettle a friendſhip, and alſo to concert on that ſide more ſenſible and more than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther important moving of Arms againſt <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> Such was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, little regarded by ſome, and derided by others, of that boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous ſtorm, which was ſeen ſoon after to over-turn <hi>Germany</hi> in its greateſt proſperity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferdinands</hi> cares were now divided betwixt <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> to retribute to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the Treaſure ſo liberally ſpent, the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours given, and the Advantages procured him by ſo many Forces through the whole occurrences of the Empire. The States of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> with a powerful Army of twenty four thouſand Foot and five thouſand Horſe held <hi>Boiſleduc</hi> beſieged, a Town which with its Territory forms a principal part of <hi>Brabant;</hi> and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formerly attempted, but by its mooriſh ſituation defended, had fruſtrated both Art and Force. <hi>Orange</hi> having now diſpoſed his Quarters within a large Circumvallation, and ſtrengthened it with Works to be wondred at, incloſed it ſo ſtrongly, that having ſhut out all ſorts of ſuccours, and where the Earth permitted advancing his approaches, rendred all other attempts uſeleſs to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> but that of a diverſion. And to this they applied themſelves but late, Competition being riſen amongſt the Commanders; becauſe the Commiſſion of <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> being by the King conferred on Count <hi>Henry of Berg,</hi> native of the Provinces of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Strangers, and particularly the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> accuſtomed to command, refuſed to obey him. The diſpute at laſt adjuſted, they reſolved to carry their Army through <hi>Friſe</hi> into <hi>Holland</hi> to oblige <hi>Orange</hi> not only to raiſe the Siege, but to give the States ſuch a blow, that putting the Country into diſorder and confuſion, Tumults might be raiſed and ſome important Conqueſts alſo made. <hi>Weſel</hi> then upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> being appointed for the place of Arms, <hi>Berg</hi> arrives there with thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Foot, ſeventy Companies of Horſe, and forty pieces of Cannon, and after having ſcattered jealouſies in ſeveral places and feigned divers attacques, paſſes that River on a ſudden, and ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Paſs upon the <hi>Iſel,</hi> eſteemed the ſtrongeſt defence in thoſe parts, advancing into the <hi>Velaw,</hi> whence without much conteſt the way opened it ſelf to <hi>Amſterdam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſame time, according to reſolutions agreed on at <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Count <hi>Montecuculi</hi> with ten thouſand Imperialiſts arrives, Count <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> with eight thouſand more being not far off, ſent on purpoſe, that with the applauſe of the Family and name he might divide the people, and put <hi>Oranges</hi> party into confuſion. <hi>Amersfort</hi> was rendred with little ado to <hi>Berg; Hem</hi> fell into the hands of <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> the <hi>Croats</hi> in particular with the terrour of their Fame and Fortune pillaging to the Walls of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> filling every thing with fear and ſlaughter. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> then apply themſelves to the Siege of <hi>Hattem,</hi> placed in a ſituation, which, beſides that it cut off correſpondence with ſome Provinces and places of importance, was of marvellous uſe for the Armies wintering in the <hi>Velaw,</hi> which is
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53750:161"/>
the heart of the Country. The place was not over ſtrong, nor the Garriſon ſufficient to defend it; yet it held out for certain days. The belief in <hi>Holland</hi> was, that for ſo many loſſes there was no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but in <hi>Orange,</hi> who was thereupon ſollicited by the Council of State to abandon <hi>Boiſleduc,</hi> and come to the aſſiſtance of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in that extremity of dangers. He, either holding, as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> believed, ſecret Correſpondence with <hi>Berg,</hi> or deſirous to reap the fruit and glory of <hi>Boiſleduc,</hi> now reduced to extremity, ſends Count <hi>Erneſt Caſimir</hi> with ſome Troops, that, animating and aſſembling the Militia of the Country, he ſhould entertain and in the beſt manner he could for ſome days oppoſe the Enemy.</p>
               <p>But chance now brought a ſpeedy and more ſecure redreſs to the affairs of thoſe Provinces. The Governour of <hi>Emrick,</hi> a <hi>Hollander,</hi> knowing that the Garriſon in <hi>Weſel</hi> was weakened, and that in the Wall, for the heightning of a Baſtion there was a place incloſed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Paliſadoes, attempts to ſurprize it there, and luckily carries it, being favoured by ſome of the Inhabitants, moſt averſe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Religion to the <hi>Spaniards. Berg</hi> and <hi>Montecuculi</hi> greatly aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at this unexpected blow, ſeeing the way of their retreat and the paſſage for their Victuals cut off by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> not to loſe their Armies and remain buried in the dirt and ditches of that low Country, thought beſt, abandoning <hi>Amersford</hi> and the Siege of <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> to withdraw themſelves ſpeedily and with ſafety into their own Provinces. Only <hi>Naſſau</hi> remained in thoſe parts to ſee what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would bring forth: But <hi>Boiſleduc</hi> in this interim being rendred to <hi>Orange,</hi> he was alſo conſtrained to be gone.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by reaſon of their applications wholly intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Italy,</hi> where they hoped for great advantages, did not reſent loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes elſewhere, but inſtead of revenging themſelves, made a new of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the United Provinces of a Truce, which by ſome, now weary of the War, being hearkened to with applauſe, was at laſt by the major part rejected, after long conteſtations, upon the perſwaſions of the Miniſters of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> who by their diligent coope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration diverted them from it, doubting, leſt to that great diverſion a ſtop coming to be put, the full tide of their Armies might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow <hi>Italy.</hi> And they had juſt occaſion for it, becauſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their ingagements elſewhere, they ſaw draw near to their Confines a brave Army of <hi>Ferdinands:</hi> Who ſent Letters before to the <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Helvetia,</hi> by which he demanded paſſage for his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies through their Country, and beſides that for the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſecurity of his Enſigns he might be permitted to keep the paſſages with his own Souldiers.</p>
               <p>The Imperialiſts by ſuch a motion aimed rather to amuſe the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> and their Confederates, to the end to take them unprovided, than to obtain what they demanded of the <hi>Cantons;</hi> nor did their aim deceive them: for whilſt with wonted ſlowneſs the <hi>Switzers</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble themſelves in <hi>Baden,</hi> and that the minds of all, with the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the Princes intereſſed, were with great trouble turned that way; the form of denying the Paſs, and the means to oppoſe it
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53750:161"/>
being under conſideration in the Diet, the Imperial Troops joyning at <hi>Meminghen</hi> in <hi>Swabe,</hi> advanced with great expedition to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans,</hi> and receiving a months pay at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>berling,</hi> marched on to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe the <hi>Steich,</hi> the ſtrongeſt Paſs of <hi>Rhetia.</hi> Nor was it difficult to poſſeſs it, being unprovided, and through the whole Country in the place of defence confuſion and fear prevailing, <hi>Majanfelt</hi> in the very brunt ran the ſame Fortune with <hi>Coira,</hi> where <hi>Monſieur de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour, who was then there, was taken and kept Priſoner. The Count <hi>John de Merode</hi> led this party of men as a Vanguard conſiſting of ten thouſand Foot and fifteen hundred Horſe. At this violence offered to <hi>Rhetia, Italy</hi> juſtly trembled, ſeeing yet greater dangers imminent. The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Reſident of the Emperour, to provoke them to greater ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions, or to make tryal of them in this Conjuncture of their great apprehenſions, communicated to the <hi>Venetians</hi> the march of theſe Troops as intended only to maintain the Rights of the Empire in <hi>Italy,</hi> to which the Catholick King alſo, ſo nearly joyned in blood and intereſt to <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> could not deny him his aſſiſtance. And therefore invited the Republick to ſecond the deſign, and adhere to their party, approved by the occaſion and by Heaven, becauſe in their friendſhip they would find quiet and advantage.</p>
               <p>The Senate always accuſtomed in the greateſt hazards to ſhew themſelves more reſolute and conſtant, in ſhort and grave words complying with their duty, applied themſelves to their own defence, making Levies and providing the chief Cities and places with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Victuals, and every other thing neceſſary. It was given out, that the War would fall to be in <hi>Friuli,</hi> though every body believed, that <hi>Mantua</hi> was to receive the firſt blow; in regard that that State, as a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> being interwoven within that of the Republick, its danger concerned it equally with their own. Wherefore after having diſpatched <hi>Marco Anthonio Buſinello,</hi> Secretary, to reſide in <hi>Mantua,</hi> they ſent the Duke a great ſum of Money, Ammunition, and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, with Matroſes and Engeniers, that he might make proviſion of Corn, and be before hand with his Fortifications. In <hi>France</hi> preſſing inſtances were made for diverſions and ſuccours. But the King, though for the inſult upon the <hi>Griſons</hi> and the arreſt of his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour he ſhewed himſelf grievouſly offended; nevertheleſs inſtead of coming back to <hi>Suſa,</hi> returns to <hi>Paris, Richelieu</hi> with the Court following him. This retreat, which afflicted <hi>Italy</hi> and ſtruck the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> with great diſlike, had not ſo much its impulſe from the Kings apprehenſion, who ſaw many of the Gentry dye and ſick in the Camp, as from the Plots which were working againſt <hi>Richelieu</hi> by the Queens in <hi>Paris,</hi> and from the retreat of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> in diſguſt, that the Queen-mother fearing, leſt he ſhould with violence take away the Princeſs <hi>Mary</hi> to marry her, had cauſed her to be kept in a manner Priſoner in the <hi>Bois de Vincennes.</hi> The King indeed had cauſed her to be ſet at liberty, but with order to his Brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themſelves, not to marry her without the Mothers conſent; whereupon againſt the Cardinal, believed the Author of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53750:162"/>
was equally ſtirred the hatred of the Queen and of the Duke. The one therefore ſets her ſelf to work his deſtruction, whilſt the other, retired into <hi>Lorrain</hi> and well received by the Duke, being greedy to involve <hi>France</hi> in a civil Combuſtion, publiſhed a Manifeſt, in which concealing the cauſes of the amorous flames, thoſe of hatred againſt the Cardinal were ſufficiently vented, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning the form of the preſent Government.</p>
               <p>The burden then of the War of <hi>Italy</hi> reſted upon the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>France</hi> perſwaded them to undergo it without fear, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of greater aſſiſtance, when invaded in their own Dominion; it ſeeming, that the <hi>Mantuan,</hi> whither the Arms of that Crown could not reach, was in all reſpects to reſt upon the care of the Republick. <hi>Monſieur de Razilier</hi> was nevertheleſs diſpatched by the King to <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> with orders that he ſhould preſs <hi>Savoy</hi> to the execution of the Accord; and thence paſſing to <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſhould incourage that Duke, and ſollicite the <hi>Venetians</hi> to take into their poſſeſſion the paſſages of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> to ſtop the <hi>Germans</hi> way; but difficulties too great oppoſed themſelves, the Imperialiſts having now <hi>Rhetia</hi> in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and being able by other ways to go into the <hi>Milaneſe;</hi> whence the <hi>French</hi> ſaw it neceſſary to change deſign and reſiſt by more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful means the prejudices feared from that ſide. Whereupon a Council being held at <hi>Paris,</hi> where was preſent the Ambaſſadour <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranzo,</hi> who conſenting that the Republick ſhould come in for a third part, it was agreed, that at a common Charge four thouſand <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> ſhould be levied, to which joyning four thouſand <hi>French</hi> Foot and five hundred Horſe, the recovery of the Paſſes by force ſhould be attempted. The counſel was ſeaſonable to hinder the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from Succours in future, and to keep the Imperialiſts diſtracted or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged amidſt thoſe Mountains, if to the warmth of the reſolution there had followed an effect of ſuitable expedition. But whilſt the Mareſhal <hi>de Baſſompiere</hi> was deſigned for the command of theſe men and the direction of the enterpriſe, and that he knowing the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ill affected towards him, feared, leſt in the heat of the buſineſs he ſhould abandon him and ruine him, and whilſt that <hi>Coevre</hi> was ſubſtituted into his place, (who for the future ſhall be called the Mareſhal <hi>d'Etré</hi>) and whom the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Griſons,</hi> mindful of things happened formerly in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> openly oppoſed; the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and the ſeaſon vaniſhed: ſo that when <hi>Baſſompiere,</hi> acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting at laſt the Charge, went amongſt the <hi>Cantons,</hi> he effected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Levy of a Body of that Nation to re-inforce the Kings Army which returned into <hi>Italy; Richelieu</hi> excuſing to <hi>Soranzo</hi> the mutation of Councils by the change of times, becauſe the plague in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted <hi>Rhetia,</hi> the Snow ſhut up the paſſages, and above all the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> on ſeveral conſiderations refuſed to carry their Arms in open Hoſtility againſt the Colours of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo Emanuel,</hi> that had ſtirred up the Emperour to ſend his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies into <hi>Italy,</hi> and with ſpecious offers had preſented himſelf for his Captain General, ſollicited the <hi>French</hi> to render to him the Town of <hi>Suſa,</hi> alledging that by the retiring of <hi>Cordua,</hi> the Corn

brought into <hi>Caſal,</hi> and the giving paſſage to their Troops to garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it, he had on his ſide fulfilled the Accord. But he at the ſame time fortifying <hi>Avigliana,</hi> and more and more cloſing in confidence with the <hi>Austrians,</hi> gave clear arguments of an irreconciled and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile mind; whereupon <hi>Richelieu</hi> lets him know, that the Crown would keep that Paſs of the <hi>Alps,</hi> till the Emperour ſhould reſtore thoſe of <hi>Rhetia</hi> to the <hi>Griſons. Ferdinand</hi> on the other ſide, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reſpect of that people by giving liberty to the Ambaſſadour <hi>Memin,</hi> quits not the poſſeſſion of the Paſſes, nor gives the Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> though in order to the Treaty of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> King <hi>Lewis,</hi> by the means of <hi>Monſieur de Sabran,</hi> inſtantly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it; but rather refuſes every thing until the Crown of <hi>France</hi> ſhould ingage it ſelf in <hi>Italy,</hi> and take part in that cauſe, the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof belonged to his Authority.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo, alledging the introducing of the <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Monferrat,</hi> refuſed to ratifie the ſaid Treaty of <hi>Suſa;</hi> but to juſtifie the delay, or rather to try mens minds, and keep the Armies in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, diſpatch to <hi>Paris</hi> the Secretary <hi>Navazza</hi> with the Preſident <hi>Monfalcon,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to offer, that <hi>France</hi> withdrawing the Garriſons out of <hi>Monferrat</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> they on their ſide would forbear troubling of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and remove jealouſies from the other Confederates of that Crown. By this it was perceived, that they had no other aim but to exclude all defence from <hi>Italy,</hi> that ſo the Imperial Troops, entring thereupon and changing name or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, it might relapſe under ſcourges and plagues yet more cruel. Advertiſements of it came already from all parts, and the ſigns of it ſeemed clear; for that other nine thouſand Foot and fifteen hundred Imperial Horſe were near their arrival, and other Troops followed them under Count <hi>Rambald Colalto,</hi> a Vaſſal of the Republick, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the Character of a <hi>Patrician;</hi> but being bred in the Wars of <hi>Germany</hi> from his younger years, and enriched with an Eſtate and Honours ſerved <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in this Expedition in the Charge of Commander in chief. But the Emperour deſiring that terror might make plain the way for his Army, to divert by fear the Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But although in the ſtraightneſs and amidſt the wants of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Troops could not long ſubſiſt, nevertheleſs being ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Money and Victuals by the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ſtay there for ſome days; for, although the march was undertaken at the inſtigation of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> yet the Seat of the Monarchy and of the Councils being far remote, and the Genius of that Nation ſlow, Correſpondencies on their ſide could not be ſpeeded in a readineſs ſuitable to the reſolutions. <hi>Spinola</hi> eſpecially was expected in <hi>Italy,</hi> deſtined thither with great reputation and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53750:163"/>
vaſt hopes, that he would correct <hi>Cordua</hi>'s errours, and reſtore the Luſtre of Arms; but the ſcantneſs of pay being not ſufficient for the greatneſs of the preparations, he prolonged his imbarking for ſome months. In this interim thirty Gallions, come out of the Ocean, were his fore-runners to ſcour the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the attempts of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet, which, as ſaid, was by way of the Sea to bring men and ſuccours into <hi>Italy;</hi> and a report was added, that they were already advanced into the <hi>Adriatick:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Venetians,</hi> accuſtomed to conſider all where there was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of much, gave command that the Fleet ſhould he ſtrengthened with ten Gallies of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Candia</hi> to be preſently armed, and greater preparations were put into an order, if there ſhould be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. At Land, watchful with the greateſt diligence, they order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the aſſembling of ten thouſand Souldiers, their Subjects, and agreed for numerous Levies of <hi>French,</hi> which were to paſs out of <hi>Provence</hi> by Sea, under the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> the Chevalier <hi>de la Valletta,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who, to quiet the Jealouſies of the Court of <hi>France,</hi> was come to <hi>Venice;</hi> and they ſent to <hi>Mantua,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering as danger approached the faith of that people to be waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, four thouſand men for the preſervation of the place, and three hundred <hi>Albaneſe</hi> to arm a Galliot and ſome Barks in the <hi>Lake,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſing money, that the Duke under his own Colours might levy four thouſand men more. But <hi>Spinola,</hi> diſ-embarking at laſt in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi> with many Souldiers and with ſeven hundred Caſes of Pieces of Eight, came to <hi>Milan,</hi> and brought the money into the Caſtle with Pomp, with money and fame recruiting the Army in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And now the <hi>Germans,</hi> who, <hi>Colalto</hi> being joyned, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thirty thouſand Foot and five thouſand Horſe, marched, and being arrived in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> extended their Quarters, longſt the Rivers <hi>Adda</hi> and <hi>Oglio,</hi> to the Confines of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> On this ſide of the ſaid Rivers coaſted upon them <hi>Marco Juſtiniano</hi> Prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor Extraordinary in the <hi>Bergamaſco,</hi> with Colonel <hi>Milander</hi> and a Squadron volant of betwixt three and four thouſand choice men, to repreſs any inſult, which the inſolence of that Army might make; but miſerably afflicting the Towns of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> they contained themſelves towards thoſe of the <hi>Venetians</hi> in great diſcipline. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing afterwards their march towards <hi>Mantua,</hi> amidſt the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the fury of Arms brought with it, Treachery was alſo diſcovered; whereupon in <hi>Viadana</hi> was arreſted a <hi>French</hi> Officer, who by means of the Prince of <hi>Guaſtalla</hi> plotted to deliver that place to the Governour of <hi>Milan;</hi> and in <hi>Mantua</hi> was made publick a Conſpiracy framed againſt the life of the Prince. It happened at this very time, that the Duke of <hi>Main,</hi> Son of <hi>Carlo,</hi> in his paſſage to <hi>Caſal,</hi> was at <hi>Pergola</hi> on the Borders of the <hi>Piacentino</hi> taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner by the Marqueſs <hi>Maleſpina,</hi> with the loſs of certain Jewels and ſome money; but delivering him to a Company of Horſe to guard him to <hi>Milan,</hi> the Duke made his eſcape and got ſafely into <hi>Caſal.</hi> Amidſt ſo great diſturbances, <hi>Spinola</hi> ſecretly exhorts the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to humble himſelf, by lodging of Souldiers, depoſiting his
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:53750:163"/>
States, and referring himſelf without exception to the clemency of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the piety of <hi>Philip. Julio Mazarino,</hi> who, as ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to <hi>Panciroli,</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> begins now to appear in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as a thin Vapour that became afterwards the brighteſt Star of <hi>Europe,</hi> carried to the Duke himſelf a project in the name of <hi>Spinola</hi> for a Ceſſation of Arms. But that being not to be practiſed without depoſiting of places and giving Quarters to Troops; and <hi>Colalto</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that he had a power to conclude a Truce, the Duke, ſhewing himſelf reſolute in the moſt perilous courſes, declares, that being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> it behoved him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to that Court every Propoſition of Accord.</p>
               <p>The miſchiefs of the War being now not to be reſtrained longer, and the Siege of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſeeming to be near, the Republick reſolves to maintain it with all their power; for which purpoſe the General <hi>Erizzo,</hi> after having ſpoken with the Duke, incamps the Army, which conſiſted of about eighteen thouſand Foot and Horſe in <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lezzo,</hi> a place which covering <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Peſchiera,</hi> was made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for its own defence, and convenient to ſend ſuccours to <hi>Mantua. Colalto</hi> publiſhing an Edict in <hi>Milan,</hi> by which in the name of the Emperour he commanded the people to withdraw their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience from the Duke, requires of the Prince of <hi>Bozzolo</hi> the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Oſtiano,</hi> and at the ſame time, without expecting an anſwer, cauſed the Count <hi>de Soragna</hi> to ſurpriſe it. Caſting a Bridge there over the <hi>Oglio,</hi> and fortifying the Banks on each ſide with a Garriſon of fifteen hundred men, the Army halts there for ſome days, either by reaſon of the Rains which fell in the Autumn, or the Feaver, which having ſeized <hi>Colalto</hi> obliged him to ſtay in <hi>Cremona.</hi> The Army at laſt marching again, the firſt places of the <hi>Mantuan,</hi> that ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (which may be called rather deſolation than ſpoil) were <hi>Vogezzo, Cigognera,</hi> and <hi>Volongo.</hi> Thence four thouſand men took their Poſt at <hi>Iſola,</hi> and fifteen Companies at <hi>Piadene. Viadana,</hi> a great place, was preſently inveſted, and the Town being not able to reſiſt, <hi>la Rocca</hi> alſo, a very weak one, after ſome ſhot of Cannon was yielded. The Duke had not placed his hopes in their defence; but thinking by cutting the Banks to have drowned the <hi>Germans</hi> in the <hi>Po,</hi> the blow ſucceeded not; for that <hi>Balduino del Monte,</hi> to whom the care was committed, had executed the order out of time. By another body of the Imperialiſts was poſſeſſed <hi>Caneto,</hi> abandoned at their firſt appearance, becauſe it was a place not to be kept, by <hi>Angelo Corraro,</hi> a noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> who, baniſhed out of his Country, had taken Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice under the Duke. There being no Town capable to reſiſt, nor Army which could diſpute their progreſs in the field, the <hi>Germans</hi> ravaged over all, deſolating and burning every thing with ſo much ſlaughter, that ſacred things being violated by the military impiety, and this uſing yet more cruelty againſt the prophane, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of arrogance of burnings, killings, and rapines, that unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Country, heretofore amongſt the pleaſanteſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> was left for a long time a hideous field, where poſterity ſhall for a great while behold the moſt outragious marks of barbariſm. Nor did the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53750:164"/>
of the Republick ſcape wholly free, after the Imperialiſts had poſſeſſed in the <hi>Mantuan</hi> the Towns of <hi>Oſtia</hi> and <hi>Pontemolino;</hi> but there being diſpoſed into ſeveral places Horſe-Guards of <hi>Cappelletti,</hi> by them and the Peaſants the <hi>Germans</hi> were often repulſed and ſometimes beaten. Some hoped, that the <hi>Seraglio</hi> might amuſe the Army for ſome days. This is an incloſure a few miles out of <hi>Mantua,</hi> made up partly by mooriſh grounds, and partly by certain Works of Earth of a great circuit and difficult to be kept; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſome were of opinion that it ſhould be defended, becauſe Winter being near, and the Enemy ſuffering by many inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and great diſbandings, the gain of certain days was reckoned for no little advantage. The Duke doubting with reaſon, leſt in ſo great a compaſs, it being not poſſible to keep it every where, the <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould break in upon ſome one part, and cut off the way of retreat for his men into <hi>Mantua,</hi> abandons it. The force then of the attacque and the care of the defence was to be reduced to about the City alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mantua</hi> is by nature of a very ſtrong ſituation; the River which at its ſource is called <hi>Sarga,</hi> iſſuing out of the famous Lake <hi>di Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> takes the name of the <hi>Mincio,</hi> and paſſing through the midſt of <hi>Peſchiera,</hi> a little below enters into the Borders of <hi>Mantua.</hi> There where the City is placed it flows into a Lake, formed by Art in thoſe times that the principal Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> torn by inteſtine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, groaned under the Tyranny of particular Lords. So that <hi>Mantua</hi> is environed with waters in the midſt of many mooriſh grounds. Certain Bridges joyn it to the Continent; the two longeſt do end, the one <hi>al Porto,</hi> which is a Citadel with regular Baſtions, the other at the Suburbs of St. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> compoſed of many houſes, but of little defence. Near to this Bridge lies the Caſtle, joyned to the City by an ancient Building, and part of the moſt ample Palace of the Dukes. Where it came neareſt to the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> three other little Bridges called <hi>della Pradella, di Puſterla,</hi> and <hi>del Thé,</hi> ſerved to as many Ports, with a certain little Iſland between, kept for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Prince. The place therefore was not thought eaſie to be won, the Artillery being not able to batter the Walls but from far; the approaches being not to be joyned to the Wall; nor the largeneſs of the Lake ſuffering ſo ſtraight a Circumvallation, but there would remain many ways open for Succours. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference it ſelf of the Walls had been very much fortified with new Works, and the Dukes Souldiers being almoſt mouldered to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the Garriſon was increaſed by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> beſides the four thouſand Foot formerly ſent, with one thouſand Foot more and five hundred Horſe. The City was now believed in a condition able to conſume the Enemy, and give time for Succours, which was alone expected from <hi>France.</hi> Great doubt only aroſe from the courage of the Inhabitants inclining to the <hi>Auſtrians;</hi> becauſe under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a great Prince, ſome imagining they ſhould have peace, and others fancying to themſelves advantages, all abhorring the preſent evils and imminent calamities, deteſted their new Maſter, as
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53750:164"/>
who ſeemed the occaſion of them. As to other places of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it was agreed, by the means of <hi>Giovanni Martiningo,</hi> Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent of the Artillery, ſent by <hi>Erizzo</hi> to <hi>Mantua</hi> to view the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, that the Duke with his men ſhould keep <hi>Governolo,</hi> where the Water-ſluces ſerved to overflow the mooriſh grounds of the Lake, and that by the Garriſon of the Republick ſhould be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Caſtel Giufre</hi> and <hi>Goito</hi> together, which ſtanding on the Banks of the <hi>Mincio,</hi> betwixt <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Peſchiera,</hi> might be greatly uſeful to help in Succours. But <hi>Governolo,</hi> abandoned with weak reſiſtance by the <hi>Mantuans,</hi> fell into the <hi>Germans</hi> power, as alſo <hi>Gazuolo,</hi> whence ſome few <hi>Venetians</hi> withdrew, who neither for the place nor for the number were able to defend it. Amidſt the flames of the <hi>Mantuan</hi> were heard alſo the tears and cryes of the <hi>Monſerrins;</hi> for <hi>Spinola</hi> ſending <hi>Philip</hi> his Son to <hi>Valenza,</hi> had commanded <hi>Ferrante Guevara</hi> with four thouſand Foot and five hundred Horſe to poſſeſs that part of the <hi>Monferrat,</hi> which is called the Lower. The groſs of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army intrenched it ſelf at St. <hi>Salvador</hi> and other Poſts about <hi>Caſal,</hi> in which <hi>Thoiras,</hi> having abandoned all places elſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <hi>Roſſignano</hi> and <hi>Ponteſtura,</hi> was with three thouſand and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot. <hi>Spinola</hi> therefore had not yet a mind to ingage himſelf in the Siege of the place, but only environ it at large and incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date it, not ſo much becauſe the Winter ſeaſon was coming on, as to keep the Army free, to oppoſe the <hi>French,</hi> if they ſhould return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new into <hi>Italy,</hi> and that the <hi>Germans</hi> in the mean time might make themſelves Maſters of <hi>Mantua:</hi> Which place taken, <hi>Caſal</hi> was after to be attacqued by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the Imperial Army to be in a readineſs to hinder Succours.</p>
               <p>Theſe deſigns were made known in <hi>France,</hi> together with the progreſs of their Arms to the prejudice of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> and the danger of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who inceſſantly put the King and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal in mind of the Word, Faith, Intereſt, and Honour of the Crown, with thoſe incitements that might provoke the warlike Nation, the magnanimous King, and his moſt generous Miniſter. But nothing was obtained but hopes and promiſes, <hi>Richelieu</hi> proteſting, that neither <hi>Italy</hi> nor the Republick ſhould receive the leaſt preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; and ſo the motion of the <hi>French</hi> was retarded till towards the end of the year, either by the agitations of Court not yet fully quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or becauſe, believing it difficult in the concourſe of ſo many Forces in <hi>Italy</hi> to maintain, with a felicity of ſucceſs equal to the expectation of the World, the Grandeur and Glory of that Crown, they had a mind that the ſtorm ſhould vent it ſelf, and, the Armies of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> conſuming themſelves in the mean time, to come upon them afterwards with freſh Troops of greater ſtrength, to give Law more eaſily to their conſumed Enemies and wearied Friends. At laſt, miſchiefs drawing to extremity, it was reſolved at <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Cardinal with Title of <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> ſhould move towards <hi>Italy,</hi> and that, to draw to Court during his abſence <hi>Orleans,</hi> who ſhewed an abhorrency to him, the King ſhould go near to receive him on the Confines of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and ſhould, to content him with ſomething
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53750:165"/>
of appearance, put under his Command a ſmall body of an Army in <hi>Champaigne</hi> for the defence of the Frontiers. The Cardinal goes out of <hi>Paris</hi> with great applauſe, carrying in his hand the Authority of the King and the Forces of the Kingdom, but not with a mind free from many cares, which his long abſence from Court gave him, and the Orders, as preciſe as deep, of the Queen-mother, which charged him, upon ſevere proteſtations of diſgrace, not to break openly with <hi>Spain.</hi> Whilſt he was ordering his march in <hi>France, Mantua</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed bitterly in the Siege.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germans,</hi> to ſay truth, declined quickly in their ſtrength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, beſides the evils of the ſeaſon and the Climate, being accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the wide Provinces of <hi>Germany,</hi> where inſtead of pay they have recourſe to military licence, they were in want, in the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Mantuan,</hi> waſted already by Sword and Fire, not only of prey, but alſo of food. So that many died, ſome languiſhed with ſickneſs, and others ſought their eſcape by running away. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Army drawing near the City, threatned the <hi>Bourgh</hi> of St. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> believing it as weak to reſiſt as convenient to lodge in. The Prince <hi>de Buzzolo</hi> going into <hi>Mantua,</hi> endeavoured to perſwade the Duke, from dangers and accidents ſomething diſturbed and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, to deliver it up, to ſhew ſome kind of reſpect to the Emperors Colours, to give occaſion for a Treaty, and to ſtop the proceedings of the Army, which being weakned and in want of many things, had no pretence but to preſerve the Emperours honour with ſome ſeeming appearance. <hi>Durant,</hi> a Colonel of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> oppoſed that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, offering to maintain the <hi>Burg</hi> with his men, and for ſome days weary and hold the Enemy play, gaining by that vigour thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which could hardly be hoped for from a ſhewing of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But the Duke, too warily preferring the deceitful before the reaſonable, ſends to the Marqueſs <hi>Frederick Gonzagha</hi> to deliver it to <hi>Aldringher,</hi> who in the place of <hi>Colalto,</hi> yet indiſpoſed, had the Command of the Army. The <hi>Germans</hi> aſcribing all to neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and not to reſpect, were ſo far from conſenting to a ſuſpenſion of Arms, hoped for by the Duke, that they rather required to put a Garriſon into the Citadel of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and to have the keeping of a Gate. They then put by the hopes of obtaining it, becauſe the Duke incenſed ſhewed himſelf reſolute to hold out and defend himſelf, planted ſeveral Batteries in the <hi>Burg,</hi> and particularly in the Church-yard, which ſtands there in a ſituation ſomething eminent. Againſt the <hi>Cereſo</hi> they raiſed others to gain that Poſt, by which they opened an entry into the Iſland of the <hi>Thé,</hi> and might better than elſewhere approach to the Walls of the City. But finding ſtout reſiſtance, and being ſeveral times with great loſs repulſed, they betook themſelves to Art, making a Truce with the Garriſon for three hours only, during which, digging ſecretly a covered way, they ſurpriſed the Poſt, the Souldiers that kept it, upon ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for aſſault, taking the flight, leaving their Ammunition and Arms behind them. <hi>Durant,</hi> by reaſon of the importance of the place, not being able to ſuffer the loſs and miſchief by it, a while
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53750:165"/>
after making a Sally, drives them out of it with great bravery, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying himſelf there in ſuch ſort, as rendred all the Enemies attempts afterwards without effect.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Germans</hi> under the favour of their Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were advanced even to the middle of the Bridge of St. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> when being aſſaulted by a ſtrong and numerous Sally, they gave way leaving their Arms and Gabions in the power of the Duke. The Citadel of <hi>Porto</hi> with its Cannon made their approach to it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; when they, craftily ſending a Trumpet to that ſide, whilſt he went ſoftly on, and the Garriſon intermitted ſhooting to expect what Meſſage he ſhould bring, they planted one Gabion, and, under covert of that, ranging others with what haſte they could, covered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by flinging up earth. Thoſe within were quit with them in another place, driving the Enemy out of an Inn they had fortified, which gave them great annoyance. But if attacques were ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, hunger in the Camp advanced, the <hi>Venetians</hi> having ſtopped all paſſages for bringing Victuals to them, and Corn, for want of which all <hi>Italy</hi> miſerably ſuffered. The Army having wanted bread for ſome days, were ready to withdraw, when Corn being abundantly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied out of the Popes Dominions by a Contract made with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaguti</hi> Merchants in <hi>Ferrara,</hi> under the name whereof it was ſaid, that the Popes Kindred by buying and ſelling made great profit. The <hi>Venetians</hi> were offended at it, complaining and concealing it not, that for the price of that Corn was ſold the liberty and ſafety of <hi>Italy.</hi> No want of Victuals was as yet in <hi>Mantua,</hi> becauſe the Republick had plentifully provided it for a year but of the Souldiery in ſo many occaſions many were loſt, and the Ammunition conſumed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it being needful to think of relief, a thouſand Foot were ſent by <hi>Erizzo,</hi> with much Ammunition, convoyed by three thouſand other Foot and four hundred Horſe, which without any ill rencoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter coming to the Lake of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and, by errour in the adjuſtment, not finding Boats ready there to carry them into the Town, were forced to retire. Nevertheleſs a little while after, Intelligence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better ſetled with the Duke, they got ſafe in, to the unſpeakable joy of the beſieged. <hi>Pietro Quirini</hi> Proveditor of the Cavalry of <hi>Croats</hi> and <hi>Albaneſe,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Milander,</hi> returning from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, meeting with ſeven hundred <hi>German</hi> Horſe carrying away ſome Booty, beat them, chaſing them in ſuch ſort, that leaving, their prey, they had no thoughts but to ſave themſelves. <hi>Aldringher</hi> made aware by this ſuccour, of what importance the place of <hi>Goito</hi> was, goes thither with three thouſand Foot and twelve hundred Horſe; and was no ſooner arrived but gave an aſſault upon it, but was bravely repulſed by the Garriſon. Bringing afterwards Cannon and with a few ſhot making a breach in the Wall, not ſupported by a Rampart, the Governour taking fright renders it againſt the will of the Souldiers of the <hi>Greek</hi> Nation, who were of the opinion to maintain it, and therefore ſo ſoon as he came into <hi>Mantua</hi> he was publickly puniſhed with infamy; whereupon a great entrance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſhut for the relieving of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53750:166"/>
to keep open at leaſt that of <hi>Caſtel Giufré,</hi> whence <hi>Erizzo</hi> let in three Companies of Relief, and committed the Guard and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Poſt to Colonel <hi>Lunge,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man. And the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts knowing now the importance of it, had their aim upon it; but by reaſon of the time of the year, and not to divide their Troops into too many parts, ſparing force for the preſent, betook themſelves to Art, cauſing <hi>Giovanni Giacomo Pancirolo,</hi> the Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> to tempt the Duke with wonted flatteries to deliver it to <hi>Colalto,</hi> that from redoubled teſtimonies of obedience to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Colours being ſatisfied, he might at laſt incline to ſome Accord, or at leaſt to a ſuſpenſion of Arms. The Duke, rendred more wary from what had happened at St. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> rejecting ſo pernicious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, placed his ſafety now more in Defence than Treaty. He moleſted the Enemy with frequent Sallies, keeping him buſied and diſtracted in ſeveral parts, and one night particularly ſurprized <hi>la Vergiliana,</hi> where the <hi>Germans,</hi> that were not killed or Priſoners, were drowned in the water by the breaking of a Bridge, by which they thought to make a running eſcape: Aſſents nevertheleſs at the endeavours of the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> that there ſhould be a ſuſpenſion of Arms for a month, but to no purpoſe; becauſe <hi>Colalto</hi> pretended to have liberty in that interim to fortifie himſelf in his Poſts, that no Victuals ſhould be carried into <hi>Mantua</hi> but from Countries far off, and that <hi>Carlo</hi> ſhould ſign Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> refuſing the Expedient, which, ſomething to facilitate the buſineſs, he offered, to ſign by the name of <hi>Carlo,</hi> or of <hi>Carlo</hi> the Duke, without expreſſing of <hi>what.</hi> Hoſtility then continuing, the <hi>Venetian</hi> General conſidering of a new ſupply, ſends under Count <hi>Bartolomo Soardo, Bergamaſco,</hi> other five hundred Souldiers with Powder and Match, that were for the moſt part <hi>Greeks</hi> that were come out of <hi>Goito,</hi> the Nation deſiring it, that by the proof of hazard the Surrender might be confirmed not to have happened by their default. They all got ſafe in, convoyed near to <hi>Goito</hi> by a Body of Horſe which halted there to beat back whatſoever coming forth ſhould diſturb their way. With this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief the beſieged taking new courage, multiplied more and more their Sallies, and in one from the <hi>Cereſo</hi> gave the Enemy a notable blow. The <hi>Germans</hi> now began to find that there was no hope ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to famiſh the place or take it; but the thoughts of retiring vexed them not leſs, whilſt the Dukes Sallies and the difficulty of the miry ways made it impoſſible to bring off the Cannon in ſafety. Applying themſelves therefore to Artifice, they cauſed <hi>Mazarine</hi> to propoſe to the Duke a ſhort ſuſpenſion of Arms. He firſt rejects it in reſpect to the <hi>French</hi> Army, upon the way for his Relief, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not to make a ſtep without the Kings knowledge. At laſt, overcome by <hi>Mazarine</hi> with the urgency and power of his words, he conſents to abſtain ten days from Sallies. It was enough for the <hi>Germans</hi> to free themſelves and withdraw the Cannon, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nevertheleſs for haſte in their Quarters certain Morter-pieces with ſome Ammunition. The <hi>Venetians</hi> would have wiſhed, that Army might rather have conſumed it ſelf in the ſufferings and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53750:166"/>
about <hi>Mantua,</hi> than opportunity been given them to retire into more commodious Quarters, and were of opinion, that ſuch Treaties ſerved rather to retard than haſten the <hi>French</hi> Succours; nor did the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> fail to make uſe of it, ſending immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, to hinder <hi>Richelieu,</hi> the advice into <hi>France,</hi> that a ſuſpenſion of Arms being ſetled, there was great hopes of an adjuſtment. But the Cardinal, knowing the deceit and what was aimed at, continues his March.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germans,</hi> though at a diſtance from <hi>Mantua,</hi> kept it never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs blocked with ſeveral Poſts, placing the principal Quarters in ſeveral Fiefs of the Empire which are thereabouts, as <hi>Nuvolara, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regio,</hi> and others, and taking it by force where Quarter was denied, as happened in the County of <hi>Mirandola,</hi> with a great blow to that little Country. The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> freed himſelf by diſburſing money, and receiving <hi>Colalto,</hi> yet indiſpoſed, in <hi>Reggio,</hi> with his Guards. In <hi>Castiglione</hi> and in <hi>Solferino,</hi> by incouragement of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who, in caſe of Force, promiſed their aſſiſtance, they were kept out by the Mothers of thoſe Princes yet under Tutelage; and in <hi>Solferino,</hi> under the name of their own Fathers, the Princeſs, <hi>Donna Marcella Malaſpina</hi> of <hi>Verona,</hi> brought ſome Souldiers of the Republick. The Duke, to enlarge himſelf and to open Commerce with the Camp at <hi>Valezzo,</hi> recovers <hi>Curtartone</hi> and <hi>Montanara,</hi> and preſenting the Cannon before <hi>Marmirolo,</hi> forced the <hi>Germans</hi> to leave it, though thoſe of <hi>Goito</hi> attempted to bring ſuccours into it, but were beat back by two thouſand Foot and a thouſand Horſe of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which under Prince <hi>Luigi d' Eſté</hi> countenanced the deſign.</p>
               <p>In this manner ends this calamitous year; for with the entrance of the <hi>Germans</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> was introduced all ſort of miſeries, and eſpecially the plague, which, notwithſtanding the cold ſeaſon, ſpread it ſelf not only in their Quarters, but in the <hi>Mantuan,</hi> the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> and the <hi>Valteline,</hi> with ſo much increaſe and mortality, that the wrath of God clearly ſeemed with the moſt cruel chaſtiſements ſet to puniſh the luxuries and diſſoluteneſs of <hi>Italy.</hi> About the end of this year dies in <hi>Venice Giovanni Cornaro</hi> Duke, laden with age and troubles no leſs for publick than private concerns, diſguſt being raiſed betwixt the Pope and the Republick, by occaſion of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal his Son, Biſhop of <hi>Vincenza,</hi> who, promoted by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> to the Biſhoprick of <hi>Padua,</hi> of a much more plentiful Revenue, was by the Laws of the Republick, elſewhere mentioned, therein oppoſed. For which cauſe the Senate denied him poſſeſſion of the Temporalities; the Pope inſiſting that it ſhould not be diſpoſed of to any body elſe. The Cardinal himſelf ſupplicates him, but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> excuſed himſelf with having haſtily propoſed it in the Conſiſtory. <hi>Cornaro</hi> would have had the new Church renounced, but they being no leſs wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at <hi>Rome</hi> to admit of ſuch an Expedient, the diſpute laſted, till, after the Dukes death, <hi>Giovanni Tiepolo,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Venice</hi> dying, the Senate (the <hi>Jus Patronatûs</hi> being in the Republick) nominates the Cardinal to that Dignity, which was alſo approved by the Pope,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53750:167"/>
who afterwards aſſigns the Biſhoprick of <hi>Padua</hi> to <hi>Marc Anthonio Cornaro,</hi> Primicerio of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and the Cardinals own Brother.

                  <hi>NIcolo Contarini</hi> being aſſumed in the beginning of this year to the Principality of <hi>Venice,</hi> the care of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate was buſied about the defence of <hi>Mantua,</hi> whoſe preſervation being to be aſcribed to the Merit of the Republick, obliged for the future to a moſt vigilant minding of it. In order thereunto they brought into it a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of Men and Proviſions in abundance, repaired the Fortifications, paying the Garriſon with their own money, and maintaining alſo the Dukes Court. <hi>Marmirolo,</hi> and <hi>Caſtiglione</hi> (called the <hi>Mantuan</hi>) were guarded by their Souldiers, the Duke having abandoned <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartone</hi> and <hi>Montanara,</hi> not to diſtract his Forces into ſo many places. Frequent and bloody occaſions happened with the <hi>German</hi> Garriſons of <hi>Caſtelluzo, Gazzulo, Borgoforte,, Governolo,</hi> and <hi>Goito,</hi> with various Fortune. The Country was full of terrour and ſlaughter. The Campagnia was made deſolate, the Churches were pillaged, and the People were killed. The Inhabitants of ſome Towns taking Arms from deſpair, drove out the Enemies Garriſons; but not having a Force to defend themſelves equal to their impatience, paid miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the penalty with fire and blood; in particular <hi>la Volta,</hi> a great place, ſuffered a chaſtiſement ſo barbarous and cruel, that no ſort of cruelty was there omitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:53750:168"/>The Mareſhal <hi>d'Eſtré</hi> was <hi>Richelieu</hi> his fore-runner in <hi>Italy,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the King to reſide in <hi>Mantua</hi> in quality of Ambaſſadour Extraordinary. He being arrived at <hi>Venice,</hi> and followed a while after by <hi>Monſieur de Sabran,</hi> a Gentleman that was ſent, paſſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>D'Avaux</hi> Ambaſſador in Ordinary, moſt effectual offices with the Senate; that they would ſend their Army into the <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> magnifying with ſuch efficacy the Generoſity of the King, the Prudence of the Cardinal, the Felicity of their Colours, the Strength of their Army, that Conqueſts ſeemed ſecure, and Spoils certain. Their conſiderations were; <hi>That the</hi> Germans <hi>were weakened by what they had ſuffered, and were almoſt conſumed by the plague;</hi> Spinola's <hi>Army diminiſhed, and the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>conſtrained to ſubmit to the Kings will, or neceſſitated, if he ſhould reſiſt, to draw the Army of the</hi> Auſtrians <hi>into the boſom of his Country, though Auxiliaries, yet lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs than Enemies. So that the Common-wealths danger was every way diminiſhed, and the Enemy removed far off. When could that Chain ever be broken, which hath already held</hi> Italy <hi>ſo many years in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, if a reſolution were not taken to ſhake it off, now that Wills, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a Conjuncture conſpired for it? Let the Senate therefore hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily reſolve to be ſtirring with their Army; for that there remained no greater enemy to be overcome than the ſlowneſs of reſolutions and heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Councils. Let them beſtow this unheard of benefit upon</hi> Italy, <hi>and procure glory to themſelves, which carried with it quiet and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, becauſe the King liberally beſtowing on his Confederates the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, contented himſelf with his own Greatneſs and with the glorious Title of the Deliverer of</hi> Italy. The <hi>French</hi> were as much fixed in the reſolution not to break with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they effectually deſired the Republick ſhould do it. But the Republick, although it knew the preſent danger to be ſo great, that it was fit not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard future hazards, perſiſted in their firſt counſels; offered to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade ſo ſoon as the Kings Army, having paſſed the <hi>Alps,</hi> ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Country on the other ſide; alledged in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the conſideration of being over-powred by the <hi>Germans,</hi> and the neceſſity of not eſloignating the Army from <hi>Mantua.</hi> The Cardinal found himſelf ingaged with the general expectation of the World, to make good with actions and counſels that great reputation, which Fame had caſt upon his perſon; ſo that he diligently purſues his march, overcoming the difficulty of the ſeaſon and the artifices of the Enemy, who by ſeveral propoſitions attempted to amuſe him. At <hi>Ambrun</hi> he gave Audience to the Nuntio <hi>Pancirolo,</hi> and in the preſence of the Ambaſſadour <hi>Soranzo</hi> gave him a Project, which contained the departure of the <hi>Germans</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> the reſtitution of what they had taken, the Inveſtiture to <hi>Carlo,</hi> and the liberty of the <hi>Griſons.</hi> But the <hi>Austrian</hi> Miniſters, affirming to have no power to treat concerning the <hi>Griſons,</hi> inſiſted, that the <hi>French</hi> Garriſons ſhould be removed out of <hi>Caſal</hi> and out of <hi>Monſerrat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Peace then amidſt ſuch contrary propoſitions being deſpaired of, the Cardinal, by means of <hi>Monſieur Servient,</hi> turns his inſtances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to give paſſage to the Army, furniſh it
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:53750:168"/>
with Victuals, and joyn his Troops to the Royal Colours. He, to ſpend time, alledged ſometimes excuſes, then made difficulty about the way the Army was to take, and the means to provide it; at laſt he deſired that the enterpriſe of <hi>Genoua</hi> might be reſolved on, and that invading conjoyntly the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> Arms might not be laid down before it was wholly conquered. Nothing preſſed the Cardinal more than to mortifie the Duke. Declaring therefore friendſhip with the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> and publiſhing the carrying of Arms into <hi>Italy,</hi> to no other end but to advance and eſtabliſh an honourable and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Peace, firmly denies him that which he had formerly offered him; nay ſeeming doubtful, leſt <hi>Carlo</hi> with ſcanty Victuals, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Quarters, and other tricks, might go about to deſtroy and conſume that Army, he demands that <hi>Avigliana</hi> ſhould be demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it being neither ſeemly to march under the view and Cannon of that place, nor ſafe to leave it behind. At laſt it was agreed after long conteſts, that the new Works being diſmantled, three hundred Souldiers ſhould be put into the old Fortreſs; but it was quickly diſcovered, that the one Party retaining diſdain ſought for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts, and the other meditating on revenge, was framing Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The <hi>French</hi> beginning their march, beheld not only the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications ſtill on foot, but the place guarded by the Duke in perſon with three thouſand Horſe and fifteen thouſand Foot, the Militia of the Country, haſtily aſſembled for a ſhew. The Cardinal was not ignorant of it; but ſhewing himſelf at the ſight thereof bitterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, was yet more moved when he ſaw the Duke with the groſs of his Army flank his march on the other ſide of the <hi>Dora.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the <hi>French</hi> Chiefs, provoked by their natural prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, adviſed, that paſſing that little River, they ſhould attacque the Squadrons of the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> who had nothing of Souldiers but the appearance. But <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who had other things in deſign, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at <hi>Caſalette,</hi> complaining, that he found not the Proviſions rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and judging the intention of <hi>Carlo</hi> to be to make the <hi>French</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my periſh with hunger, and give time to the <hi>Austrians</hi> to come to his aſſiſtance. The Duke comes thither to him, partly excuſing whatever was wanting by the univerſal ſcarcity, and partly accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the haſty motion of the Army. But in this Conference nothing paſſing but mutual complaints, they ſeparated with perfect hatred and greater ſuſpicions. Amidſt theſe eager conteſts the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour <hi>Soranzo</hi> goes to <hi>Turin</hi> to mediate, ſent by the Cardinal to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the Duke to facilitate the paſſage and enter into the League, offering him in the Name of the King, to inveigle him, the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of ſix thouſand Foot and four hundred Horſe, of thoſe Troops, which for the Invaſion of the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> he was bound to joyn to the Army of the Confederates. The deſign of the Cardinal perhaps was, to ſend the Ambaſſadour further from him, that by his importunate counſels, knowing that the <hi>Venetians</hi> would not like the ingaging of the <hi>French</hi> Forces in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he might not attempt to diſturb the deſigns he intended; for <hi>Soranzo</hi> remaining yet in <hi>Turin,</hi> the Cardinal the 18. of <hi>March</hi> in the night ſuddenly recalling ſome
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:53750:169"/>
Troops which were advanced, and repaſſing the <hi>Dora,</hi> ſends two thouſand Horſe to <hi>Rivali,</hi> a Houſe of Pleaſure in the Country, to ſurprize the Duke, and make him with his Son <hi>Vittorio</hi> Priſoners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo</hi> kept himſelf there, to make ſhew, as was his cuſtom, of an unconcerned mind and generous heart, in delights and divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amongſt the greateſt cares and in the midſt of danger it ſelf. But getting notice of it by a Confident he had in the <hi>French</hi> Camp, which was ſuſpected to be the Duke <hi>de Momorancy,</hi> he could hardly get ſafe with his Son into <hi>Turin;</hi> where preſently ſhutting the Gates, manning the Walls, impriſoning ſome <hi>French,</hi> which were come in to ſee the Citadel, and cauſing others, which ſerved the Princeſs, to be put in cuſtody, the defence was in a moment ordered, out of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that the Cardinal would without delay inveſt the place. If the Duke, for this attempt of taking him Priſoner, flamed out publickly into rage, <hi>Richelieu</hi> was vexed at heart, that the deſign had failed him, and preſently betaking himſelf to his wonted Arts, diſpatches <hi>Monſieur Servient</hi> to <hi>Turin</hi> to ſpeak with the Prince and the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour <hi>Soranzo.</hi> The Duke hindring him of acceſs to the one and to the other, and to <hi>Soranzo</hi> himſelf, deteſting the craft and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Cardinal, refuſes, (giving him liberty to be gone) to hearken further to any overtures. And entring into ſuſpicion, that he might have had a hand in this contrivance, or vexed that the Arms and endeavours of the Republick oppoſed his ends, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges alſo the ordinary Ambaſſadour <hi>Franceſco Cornaro,</hi> who had order from the Senate to paſs in that quality to the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal imploying with equal dexterity the ſubtilties of Treaty and the Stratagems of War, makes as if he would attacque <hi>Turin,</hi> to draw defence and forces to the Metropolis. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bends towards <hi>Pignerol,</hi> cauſing it to be inveſted by <hi>Crequi</hi> with ſix thouſand Foot and a thouſand Horſe, and the day after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons it with the whole Army. The Town is twelve miles diſtant from <hi>Turin,</hi> ſituate upon a height, where the <hi>Alps</hi> terminating, or rather intermitting, certain Vallies fall in, which worthily give it the name of a large and eaſie entrance into <hi>Italy.</hi> It being not ſtrong, and one part of the Garriſon being gone to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Turin,</hi> the Town held out but one day. Count <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban di Schalenge,</hi> the Governour, was retired into the Citadel, which is in the higheſt part of it. But ſeeing himſelf but with a few men, and environed by a potent Army, nay with an Enemy, that under the ſhelter of the Town at their firſt arrival faſtened themſelves to a Bulwark, renders it the 30. of <hi>March,</hi> which was <hi>Easter</hi>-day. All the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent places, Vallies, and certain Forts thereabouts, newly built by the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> followed without diſpute, <hi>Richelieu</hi> triumphing at it, who preſently orders, to incloſe the Town with Royal Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as from that time deſigning it for the foundation of more vaſt deſigns. The Duke diſturbed both for the loſs and the inſult, but unable to revenge himſelf, had in his mind moſt vexing and violen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

and now reduced to an unhappy old age, ſaw his Maxims ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hopes defeated. He had in his boſom an Enemy implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and a Conquerour, nor ſaw other refuge but a recourſe to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Austrians,</hi> though they would prove little leſs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive and burdenſom, well underſtanding, that if the <hi>French</hi> Army had made paſſage into one Town, neceſſity obliged to ſet others wide open to the <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Whereupon, after waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a while between various counſels, making his Country the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of War, deſpairing to pacifie the <hi>French,</hi> he reſolves to caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the arms of the <hi>Austrians.</hi> The Abbot <hi>de Scaglia</hi> was ſent to the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who rejoyced more at the ingagement of the <hi>French</hi> than he was troubled at the Dukes loſſes. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that he might not be precipitated into a miſbecoming accord, he ſends two Regiments of Foot to his relief, and together with the Count <hi>Colalto</hi> goes to <hi>Carmagnola</hi> to confer with the Duke: where he requiring more vigorous aſſiſtance, <hi>Spinola</hi> refuſing, in regard of his own deſigns, to diſmember his Army, it was reſolved to ſuccour him with a Body of the <hi>Germans,</hi> ſeven thouſand more being now arrived in <hi>Italy.</hi> Theſe then coming into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> with the ſavage cuſtom to exerciſe publick Robbery and the cruelleſt of Spoils, left it doubtful, whether they contributed to the defence or the deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Duke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Spinola</hi> now believing to have oppoſed a defence ſufficient againſt the <hi>French,</hi> becauſe the Army of the <hi>Savoyards</hi> amounted to twenty thouſand Foot and ſix thouſand Horſe, and together with a Body of the <hi>German,</hi> under the title of Auxiliaries, to have chained up the Dukes inconſtancy, reſolves to attacque <hi>Caſal,</hi> and what with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and force to take it. <hi>Philip Spinola,</hi> his Son, with four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot poſſeſſes <hi>Ponteſtura,</hi> twelve hundred <hi>French,</hi> after a ſhort defence, marching out, on condition not to go into <hi>Caſal,</hi> but to paſs by way of the Sea into <hi>Provence. Roſſignano</hi> was by the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon abandoned, <hi>Thoiras</hi> judging it better to reduce the vigour of the defence to within that place. <hi>Caſal</hi> was afterwards, in the month of <hi>May,</hi> environed with the whole Army, notwithſtanding that the Miniſters of the Pope wearied themſelves with many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to have diverted the thought of it, and that the Cardinal <hi>Anthonio,</hi> Legate, went to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> thence to <hi>Turin,</hi> and to the <hi>French</hi> Camp: But in ſeveral Conferences with the Duke, with <hi>Richelieu,</hi> with the Imperial Miniſters, and thoſe of both the Crowns, finding jealouſies exceeding, and hatreds not to be dealt with, he thought it beſt to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> leaving <hi>Pancirolo</hi> with <hi>Mazarine</hi> in <hi>Piedmont</hi> to proſecute a Treaty. The War then continues at the coſts and loſſes of the <hi>Savoyards;</hi> for beſides the Vallies about <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol,</hi> the Cardinal eaſily poſſeſſed himſelf alſo of the Marquiſate of <hi>Saluſſes.</hi> The King on the other ſide, having received his Brother into favour, and being come into <hi>Savoy,</hi> had in four days taken <hi>Chambery,</hi> which is the Metropolis, and every place elſe, except <hi>Momilian,</hi> ſtrong both by ſituation and Art. But leaving the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>di Vignoles</hi> to block it, went himſelf into the <hi>Tarantaſia,</hi>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:53750:170"/>
where forcing the oppoſition of Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> and paſſing the Mountain St. <hi>Bernardo,</hi> he lays the paſſage open every way. Upon this new irruption of the <hi>French, Spinola</hi> began truly to be in diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but unwilling to quit the Siege, was contented to leſſen his Forces, by ſending to the Duke five Companies of Horſe and ſix thouſand <hi>German</hi> Foot, newly come to the Service of the Crown.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal, by reaſon of the diminution of his Army, concluding no further progreſs would be made worthy of his preſence, and by the force of his favour longing to be with the King, goes to him, leaving the Army about <hi>Pignerol,</hi> which quickly waſted by ſeveral accidents, particularly the plague, which notwithſtanding the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> remained at <hi>Poncalieri</hi> immoveable, though weakened. For the ſame cauſe the further proceedings of the King were ſlackned; for through apprehenſions of the plague being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to return to <hi>Lyons,</hi> though a few days after he came again to the Army into the Valley of <hi>Moriene,</hi> nevertheleſs falling into a Feaver, he was carried back to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where, contrary to his liking, both the Queens being arrived, under pretext to withdraw him from the hazards to which <hi>Richelieu</hi> expoſed him, they tryed all means to ſlacken, to the prejudice of the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the progreſs of the Army, and to fling the Cardinal out of his Miniſtry and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>The Confidents of Queen-mother went to work with Art, and the Marqueſs of <hi>Mirabel,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> with abundance of gold gained in a manner openly a Party in Court, in which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent her ſelf had the chiefeſt place. Amidſt theſe guſts of War and Court, <hi>Mazarine</hi> brought projects for Peace, all the ſecret workings of the <hi>Austrians</hi> conſiſting in excluding the <hi>French</hi> out of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Cardinal, in truth, held the Conqueſt of <hi>Pignerol</hi> for his dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; nevertheleſs, preſſed by the Queen-mother, with earneſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives or rather preciſe commands, lets himſelf, to faciliate Peace, be perſwaded to reſtore it; declaring to the Mediators, that other things being adjuſted, the Peace ſhould not remain interrupted for the cauſe of <hi>Pignerol.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> not able to put off the diſtruſt of the <hi>French</hi> Army, nor <hi>Spinola</hi> the hopes of conquering <hi>Caſal,</hi> the Treaty for this time alſo falls to the ground. In the <hi>Mantuan,</hi> the pillaging of the Campagnia, the burning of places, the rencounters of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery paſſed with indifferent ſucceſſes. The worſt was, that the plague from the Quarters of the <hi>Germans</hi> getting into the City, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured every thing: So that as many Souldiers as were brought in by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> into whoſe Country that evil was now creeping, they ſerved but to fill up Sepulchres; nevertheleſs ſuccours were not neglected, ſo much the more neceſſary as that a worſe enemy, which was the alienation of the people from the Duke and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Nobility towards the Emperour, began to take great ſtrength within. Some there were ſo much the more perfidious, as by how much the more ſecret, who feigning confidence, ſometimes amuſed the Duke with falſe advertiſements, then terrified him with
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53750:170"/>
vain fears, rendring him in counſels and reſolutions always wavering and uncertain. Amongſt the worſt fruits thereof, it happened, that being deceived by feigned advertiſements, he ſent five hundred Foot of thoſe of the Republick to <hi>Rodigo,</hi> an open Village, to ſurprize a great Convoy of Victuals, which he believed was to paſs towards <hi>Goito,</hi> and haſtily requires <hi>Zacharia Sagredo,</hi> who by the indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Erizzo</hi> was ſucceeded into the Generalat of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that on his ſide he would ſecond him with a body of his men.</p>
               <p>The Prince <hi>d'Eſté</hi> with two thouſand Foot and four hundred Horſe goes as far as <hi>Goito,</hi> but finding no Intelligence from the Duke, nor advice of the Convoy, returned. <hi>Matthias Galaſſo,</hi> who ſtood watching the opportunity to give this blow as in ambuſh, with four thouſand Foot and eight hundred Horſe advances to inveſt <hi>Rodigo,</hi> conſtraining the Souldiers to render themſelves, and making them all Priſoners; though with life liberty was alſo promiſed by the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Things then thus fluctuating in the <hi>Mantuan</hi> and in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> the Republick ſollicited the <hi>French,</hi> that for incouragement of the Duke no leſs than for the defence of the City and the ruling of the people, they would ſend a good body of men by Sea, offering to convoy them with their Naval and Land-forces, and to bring them in ſafety into <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Cardinal referring to them the care of that defence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them alſo to reſolve with an effort of their Arms to drive the <hi>Germans</hi> from thoſe Poſts, which incommodated the City, ſince <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalto</hi> with the greateſt ſtrength of the Imperial Troops were now buſied in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> He cauſed this inſtance to be made with great fervency and with power; and it being therefore neceſſary to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate about it in the Senate, <hi>Pietro Foſcarini, Savio</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, perſwading to comply with it, ſpake thus; <hi>If the reſolutions of Princes were inflexible, and that States were governed by everlaſting Decrees, our diſcourſe and the bringing reaſons in the preſent caſe would be in vain; becauſe rather than ſeek them by the light of prudence, which God kindles in mens minds, they would be found in the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials where Rules and Precepts are regiſtred. But Empires are not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Principles; they are rather regulated by their Intereſts, which taking a Proſpective from times and occaſion, repreſent various Events with variety of Counſels. I deny not, but that hitherto the opinion, to cooperate for the common Liberty by auxiliary Arms, not to provoke the</hi> Auſtrians, <hi>to expect the</hi> French <hi>Succours to come nearer to us, hath been commended by the event; becauſe the</hi> Dutch <hi>being haraſſed and waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Mantua <hi>maintained by ſeaſonable Succours, time given to King</hi> Lewis <hi>to come to the</hi> Alps, <hi>the Republick hath deſerved the juſt Title of the Defender and Protector of the Liberty of</hi> Italy. <hi>But it will be a too obſtinate prudence to continue always in the ſame thoughts, and that wind will at laſt blow contrary, which hitherto hath conducted us favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably. The Rules of the Sea and of the Port are not the ſame. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into it, and enjoy a calm, it is neceſſary to change the order. Your conſtancy, O Fathers, hath merited much in ſhewing your ſelves the alone Maintainers of the</hi> Italian <hi>Generoſity, in oppoſing and reſiſting the moſt
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53750:171"/>
powerful Princes, in aſſisting the Rights of the Duke of</hi> Mantua, <hi>uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Justice of his Cauſe, defending that City with your own money, with your own Garriſons, and I'le ſay more, with your own dangers. But this is the nature of Glory, that every little Cloud which is oppoſite to it defiles and eclipſes it. I muſt needs ſay, much hath been done, but ſomething yet is wanting; for though</hi> Mantua <hi>be preſerved from the Siege, it is not therefore freed from preſent damages and future dangers. So long as it remains begirt with the Enemies Poſts, and that their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters remain about it, that Succours are diſputed, that according to the ſucceſs of every Convoy its ſubſiſtance is hazarded, that Plots and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences are carrying on; I am afraid of open dangers, and much more of ſecret Treacheries. Who knows but that this very night while we ſleep, and that a certain falſe ſecurity makes way for it, and flatters us with the juſt applauſe of great deſerts for having maintained</hi> Mantua <hi>till now, it may not be ſurpriſed, and within the Walls thereof our own ſafety expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to hazard? What will avail the blood ſpilt, the Treaſures ſpent, the dangers run, if we be overcome by our own counſels and reſerves? It is now become a neceſſity to remove the Enemy, to diſlodge him, ſend him packing, and revenge, with the ſacrilegious blood of thoſe Souldiers, both Heaven and Earth equally violated and offended. It is marvellous to conſider the Senate a little while ago ſo couragious, as to have made head againſt a numerous Army, come out of</hi> Germany, <hi>laden with Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, animated with Fury, and uſhered in by Fame, and that now, too wary, they have reſpect to the miſerable reliques of a few Garriſons, which remain as the ſhadows of the Fortune they have run, having out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived ſufferings, plague, and penury. Let us herein, O Fathers, fix a reſolution, that by the ſuperiority of our Forces we ſhall beat them with ſafety, drive them away with glory, and ſhall then enjoy with quiet the fruit of paſt labours. What danger may we peradventure meet with? Are not theſe few</hi> Germans <hi>the miſerable reſts of that veteran Army, which we have forced to remove further of</hi> Mantua? <hi>Are they not the very ſame, that having every where lain in wait for our ſuccours, have never been able to hinder them, much leſs durſt attacque them? Are not thoſe which ought to be aſſaulted in their Poſts, the very ſame who often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times come and look upon our Convoys? And if we make no doubt at all times to expoſe the choiceſt of our Forces to convoy our Succours, why ſhould we fear, when a greater reward is in queſtion, to put Fortune once to the tryal? Let us ſuppoſe at worſt</hi> Mantua <hi>loſt, as certainly it will be, if we ſuffer it to be expoſed to continual contingencies, can we believe our modeſty will be reſpected by him, that hath ambition for his Guide, and the deſire of Dominion for his Limits? Will the</hi> Auſtrians, <hi>do you think, make leſs of our paſt offences than of our preſent injuries? I cannot ſee any difference betwixt fighting with them from the Walls of</hi> Mantua, <hi>and aſſaulting them in their own Trenches. Let us not, I pray, truſt Princes that have power, and are offended. We deceive our ſelves too much to believe the</hi> Auſtrians <hi>either ſatisfied with our paſt actions, or pacified with our preſent reſpect. But if we ought not to repent our ſelves of what we have done, why ſhould we abſtain from new attempts, ſo much the more juſt, as they have no further aim, but
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:53750:171"/>
to deprive them of the means of offending us? May we perhaps appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that an Inundation of</hi> Germans <hi>will come upon us to revenge the blood of the firſt? But who warrants us, that they come not expreſly upon us to blot out the ſhame for the ill ſucceſs of their undertaking? Will they think of paſſing into</hi> Italy, <hi>that ſhall perceive no foot-ſteps of their Companions but Graves and Sepulchres? But how much more ſhall we be expoſed to their injuries, when in our bowels, which the</hi> Mantuan <hi>may be ſaid to be, they will keep footing in their Poſts, and perhaps in the City, which muſt with the expence of time and blood be endeavoured to be regained? But let other Troops come; who ſees not but</hi> Piedmont <hi>will give them imployment; that the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>calls for them, that the plague conſumes them, that wearineſs and ſufferings, ſo ſoon as arrived, disbands them? The Invaſions of the</hi> French <hi>Army does at preſent take up their cares and their forces; and we alſo, when all is done, to a great King and Friend, that hath twice at our inſtance cauſed his moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Armies to paſs the</hi> Alps <hi>upon the Ice, nay hath paſſed them himſelf in perſon, owe this gratitude to ſecond his attacques with our Arms; otherwiſe I fear that the</hi> French <hi>Succours will quickly grow tired, when they perceive, they are made uſe of for a pretext and ſhadow to our ſloth. I know that great deliberations are ſubject to uncertainty, that of War eſpecially, which is the moſt peculiar Tribute of Fortune. But in things difficult, where by reaſon of danger counſel is not hearkned to, ſome ſteps muſt be left to Chance; for though through unthought of accidents the ſucceſs ſhould not fully juſtifie the prudence and neceſſity of the reſolution, it will at leaſt abſolve us from the blame and reproaches of a ſuperfluous reſervedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many mens minds were carried away with this opinion; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers contradicting it, <hi>Giovanni Nani, Savio</hi> of the Council, ſpake for them to this purpoſe; <hi>In the Decrees of the Country I preſage moſt happy events. But in the ſtrange Revolutions of times, I cannot promiſe them other than what the condition of things permit, very full of anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and uncertain. Sometimes hopes ſtirs us, and then again fear diſturbs us. But prudence ought to be the ſacred Anchor which ſhould keep us conſtant and firm amidſt the uncertainties of this afflicted Country. Great is the felicity of this Republick, which till now hath not known how to deſire greater prudence in its Decrees, nor wiſh for better For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Generoſity hath gone hand in hand with the moderation of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and if therein Courage hath not been wanting, ſucceſs hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded Courage.</hi> Mantua <hi>is preſerved to its lawful Prince;</hi> Italy <hi>is defended from more heavy Chains; our Confines and our Intereſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main untouched, if not by threats and dangers, at leaſt from Invaſions. What avails it to provoke Fortune further, or attempt longer to make our ſelves famous. Some</hi> Germans <hi>remain for the cuſtody of certain Poſts; but if they be ſuch as we think we may overcome with a diſcourſe only, wherefore ſhould we be ſo much afraid of them, why ſhall we ſuffer our ſelves to run into deſperate Counſels? I expreſly call thoſe Counſels ſuch, to which neceſſity perſwades us not; thoſe that not remedying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evils, haſten future calamities. Shall we attacque the</hi> Germans <hi>in their Poſts, fortified, guarded, and provided? They will yield to us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53750:172"/>
in number, but will have advantage from courage and neceſſity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no refuge but to deſpair and their Arms. There is no reaſon to deſpiſe them, a people made Souldiers by years, fierce by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, uſed to fight, wont to overcome, who, if they have blunted their fierceneſs againſt the Walls of</hi> Mantua, <hi>will in the field, where the</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Nation uſes to be invincible, repair with honour the loſſes they have ſuffered both of prey and glory. I have a regard for the</hi> Dutch <hi>even in their Quarters, and am alſo afraid to overcome them, leſt fighting and poſſeſſing thoſe Poſts, and mingling our ſelves with the conquered, we ſhould meet with a more cruel Enemy. The plague will infect our Army, and with the Army will in the concluſion infect and waſte the Country. Let us call to mind, what cares, what time, what money the raiſing of this Army hath coſt us, and upon thoſe reflections let us conſider, if they ought to be expoſed to unprofitable hazards, or be preſerved for more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Encounters. Let us, I pray, ſuffer our Enemies to conſume them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in wants and ſickneſs, and let it not be thought our intereſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their ruine with the danger of our own deſtruction. Heaven, made the Minister of our revenge, with the ſcourges of Nature puniſhes their wickedneſs. On the one ſide I confeſs I value the Enemies, and on the other I fear the caſual accidents of War. I know not what we may therein poſſibly meet with. This I know for certain, that Fortune uſes to delude the moſt adjuſted counſels, and can overturn in a moment glory gotten, and the hope of better ſucceſs. In that Army which lies incamped at</hi> Valezzo <hi>is placed our defence and the relief of</hi> Mantua. <hi>It is therefore needful to preſerve it and keep it as the utmoſt bound of our own and the common ſafety. Let us take a right meaſure of the State, Times, and Forces. Can we poſſibly hope, with one Victory, or rather with one advantage, to terminate the War? It will riſe again more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and more cruel when we turn our ſelves again to provoke it. May not the</hi> Germans <hi>perhaps come back out of</hi> Piedmont, <hi>and the</hi> Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards <hi>ſend a part of their Army, which upon our moving may re-inforce their Poſts, or invade our Confines? Does peradventure</hi> Germany, <hi>which is a Work-houſe ſo abounding with Warriers, want Souldiers and Armies, or will it be ignorant of the way to lead an Army to repair upon us their loſſes and affronts? We ſee at preſent a great number of freſh Troops deſcending the Mountains. We already hear, that</hi> Walle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain <hi>offers himſelf to overwhelm</hi> Italy <hi>with Armies, and to come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in perſon with his wonted Miniſters, Outrage and Cruelty. In</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthia <hi>and</hi> Stiria <hi>we hear the Drums beat from our Confines, and we ſee our ſelves every where environed with Armies and with threatnings, and ſhall we think to overcome the</hi> Auſtrians <hi>by driving them out of ſome Quarter? For my part I believe, that they have hitherto born re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our Affairs and Confines out of equity and neceſſity, which in our reſolutions our Enemies themſelves cannot deny. But if we ſhall aſſault or provoke them with offenſive Arms, there is great appearance, that we ſtir up againſt us the reſentments of two great Princes with ſtrokes more dangerous. I ſpeak not of the</hi> French <hi>Succours, becauſe being ingaged in</hi> Piedmont, <hi>there is no means to enjoy them nearer. Overturning then our Maxims, our Counſels, and all our Advantages, ſhall we declare
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53750:172"/>
our ſelves at preſent, and alone make War with the</hi> Auſtrians? <hi>In a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation ſo weighty, let us fully weigh the preſent with future dangers, and if Liberty be our Kingdom, let us put our ſelves in mind, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and peace have always been its moſt faithful Guardians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After ſome wavering in opinions, every one, as to the things ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, having in his judgment motives for the one or other Party, the moſt generous counſels prevailed over the more wary, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence to the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, it was referred to <hi>Sagredo,</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to prepare for the march, and undertake thoſe attempts to diſlodge the <hi>Germans,</hi> which by concert with the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> and the Mareſhal <hi>d'Eſtré,</hi> ſhould be judged fit. The ſaid Mareſhal was come into <hi>Mantua</hi> in quality of Ambaſſadour Extraordinary from the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and General of its Forces, to ſhew the protection which the King would take of thoſe Intereſts, and had found the Duke much troubled and perplexed; becauſe he being naturally inclined to diſcourſe rather, and undertake great matters, than with conſtancy to perfect them, finding himſelf pierced to the quick with tormenting cares, ſeemed weighed down under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his new Principality. He wanted not ſecret allurements from his Enemies, nor perverſe counſels from feigned Servants; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much encompaſſed with Treacheries as abandoned by ſound diſcernings. All this diſpleaſing him, which was working for his ſafety, he would not conſent to what was concerted, and haſtened, to others prejudice, his own ruine. In a Conference betwixt the Mareſhal and <hi>Sagredo,</hi> an attempt upon <hi>Goito</hi> being reſolved on to be executed by the Army of the Republick, which was encamped at <hi>Valezzo,</hi> it was agreed, that part of the Garriſon of <hi>Mantua,</hi> making a Sally, ſhould alarm the reſt of the Poſts. But notwithſtanding that they were the Republicks own men, and that they offered to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them with five hundred other Foot and three hundred Horſe, <hi>Carlo,</hi> alledging that he remained with the City ill provided, diſſents ſo openly from it, that they were forced to change the reſolution, and the two Generals to meet anew. During this ſuſpence, <hi>Michael Priuli,</hi> Proveditor in the <hi>Veroneſe,</hi> drives the <hi>Germans</hi> out of <hi>Ponte Molino</hi> and out of <hi>Ostia.</hi> In this Town, which, by reaſon it was well inhabited and ſituated upon the <hi>Po,</hi> is of ſome moment, the people had formerly made an attempt to rid themſelves of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, but in vain; becauſe retiring into the Citadel, and Succours arriving from the neighbouring places, they were able to recover it again, though, to the incouragement of the Inhabitants, ſome Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers came to them from the State of the <hi>Venetians. Priuli</hi> now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before it, better provided, brought to paſs, that the <hi>Germans</hi> abandoned it, without making any defence. At <hi>Volta</hi> alſo <hi>Quirini,</hi> Proveditor of the Cavalry, takes Poſt, and leaves there for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it <hi>Coſimo,</hi> one of the Marqueſſes <hi>del Monte.</hi> But the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe on <hi>Goito,</hi> which conſiſted much in expedition, unhappily came to nothing, by reaſon of the delays. For the <hi>Germans</hi> having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten notice of the deſign, recalled with great ſpeed out of <hi>Piedmont</hi> a good body of men, and <hi>Gallas</hi> entred into <hi>Goito</hi> with twenty Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53750:173"/>
of Foot, intending to fortifie it. Nevertheleſs <hi>d'Estré</hi> and <hi>Sagredo</hi> judged, that taking Poſt at <hi>Rivalta, Mantua</hi> would be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the taking of <hi>Goito</hi> made eaſie. No leſs by this attempt could the Dukes mind be overcome. Whereupon they were forced every day to change deſigns; and yet they were retarded, becauſe <hi>Monſieur de Sciabant,</hi> who carried the Word betwixt the two Generals, falling into an ambuſh, happened to be Priſoner with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> ſo that they ſuſpecting, that he might have diſcovered the deſigns, it was needful to change them, giving always more time to the <hi>Germans</hi> to ſtrengthen themſelves,</p>
               <p>The reſolution was at laſt fixed, that the Army of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſhould paſs from <hi>Valezzo</hi> to <hi>Marmirolo,</hi> and to <hi>Caſtiglione Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuano,</hi> Towns already garriſoned, but which now ſeemed fit to lodge the whole body, to the end to take counſel afterwards from the occaſion, if <hi>Goito</hi> might be attacqued, or ſome other Quarter of the <hi>Germans</hi> be aſſaulted, at leaſt to divide and incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them. To prepare the way for the deſign, <hi>la Valetta</hi> with three thouſand Foot and ſome Horſe advances to <hi>Villa bona</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengo,</hi> being convoyed with a greater ſtrength of men by <hi>Candale</hi> and <hi>Quirini,</hi> who were immediately to return to <hi>Valezzo</hi> ſo ſoon as they ſhould ſee him within thoſe Poſts to have begin to fling up earth. A little while after <hi>Gallas</hi> comes with great vigour to attacque him, and although at the firſt aſſault he was bravely repulſed, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs cauſing five Cannons to advance, he began ſo to demoliſh thoſe unperfected Trenches, that the Souldiers, remaining without ſhelter, fell by whole Files in the field. Being conſtrained to yield to the fury of the Aggreſſors, which entred every where, <hi>Valletta</hi> being hurt, remaining with ſome other Officers Priſoner, the others were diſperſed, every one ſeeking his eſcape. Some paſſing through the thickeſt of the Enemies Squadrons got into <hi>Mantua,</hi> others return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Valezzo,</hi> and they with greater hurt than the Enemy could have done; becauſe either from fear or excuſe aggravating the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they filled the Camp with confuſion and fear. In effect, the Quarter of <hi>Valezzo</hi> being of a great circuit, and defended with a weak Intrenchment, reſented enough this blow, both by reaſon of the number of Souldiers loſt or diſperſed, and alſo by reaſon of many others, which were ſeparated into ſeveral Poſts, and were not eaſie matter to be recalled; for that <hi>Gallas,</hi> ſeconding the preſence of ſo favourable Fortune, forming in a trice with other men, which joyned to him, a body of eight thouſand Foot and fifteen hundred Horſe, and marching thitherwards, gave no opportunity for Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſcarce for Councils. A Council being haſtily called, it was, by opinion of <hi>Candales</hi> and the other Chiefs of the Army, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to preſerve the Army, ſince it was not believed the Poſt could be defended. With the beſt order then that the caſe and time permitted, the Cannon was withdrawn in ſafety, the Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition fired, and the Militia ordered to march to <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Peſchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>era</hi> to divide the defence of the Country. The major part, by reaſon of the nearneſs, taking towards <hi>Peſchiera, Gallas,</hi> who had hoped to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53750:173"/>
ſubdue at one blow the Quarter of the beſt Troops of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, ſeeing the deſign failed, letting <hi>Valezzo</hi> lye, purſues them with great ſpeed, and ſeveral Skirmiſhes paſſing for ſeveral hours, the conteſt particularly grew hot at <hi>Caſtel Novo,</hi> to the greater loſs of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> of whom ſome valiantly fighting fell, and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves baſely to flight, leaving ſome Colours in the hands of the Enemy.</p>
               <p>The Fame, in truth; was greater than the effect of the <hi>Austrians</hi> Victory, few being on the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſide killed, but the number of the diſbanded great; ſome of which, and in particular the Cuiraſſiers, who abandoning the troth of their Oath, for prey infeſted with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Robberies the Country, which they were obliged to defend. <hi>Gallas</hi> not willing to ingage himſelf further under the Walls of <hi>Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiera,</hi> poſſeſſes without reſiſtance <hi>Valezzo,</hi> abandoned by <hi>Cornelio Vimes,</hi> who had the cuſtody of the Caſtle, and judging it a Poſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to endamage the Republick, and to hinder <hi>Mantua</hi> of Relief, environs it with a Fortification not ſo large. This ſo unhappy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs happened on the 30. of <hi>May.</hi> Fame quickly divulges it, ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſeveral places fear, and with fear the dangers of worſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; becauſe not only the <hi>Germans</hi> pillaged the Campagnia, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much miſchief, but there were diſcourſes of more cruel threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of attacques in <hi>Friuli</hi> and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> where two thouſand Foot with ſome Companies of Horſe made a ſhew of invading the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Bergamo</hi> and <hi>Crema,</hi> and a Body of <hi>Germans,</hi> which were coming through the <hi>Valteline,</hi> making a halt in <hi>Troana,</hi> it ſeemed as if, paſſing the Mountains, they would come to their aſſiſtance. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> might either have come to <hi>Peſchiera,</hi> or have advanced to <hi>Verona.</hi> But Conquerours can ſeldom undertake all that Fortune counſels, and of the conquered the danger is wont always to be greater than the loſs. Mens minds at <hi>Venice</hi> were truly diſturbed at the arrival of the news; but the conſtancy of the Government, and the fidelity of the people not at all wavering, it was made known, that, to ſecond proſperity, belonged only to private perſons, but that it was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Princes to grapple with the greateſt of misfortunes.</p>
               <p>The firſt care the Senate took, was, to conſole the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> promiſing him vigorous aſſiſtances, leſt, dejected by ſiniſter ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, he might abandon himſelf to more deſperate courſes. They writ afterwards to the Magiſtracy of the City, animating the people amidſt ſo great a tryal. Neither were ready ſupplies wanting, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place ſtriving to exceed other in the offers of money and men; <hi>Breſcia</hi> above all making it ſelf famous by the offer, that twenty thouſand men of that Territory ſhould take Arms for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and all other occurrences. <hi>Erizzo</hi> was ordered to ſucceed <hi>Sagredo</hi> in the place of Proveditor General for the War; two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, come by Sea out of <hi>France,</hi> ſerved for a ſeaſonable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement to the Garriſons, with other two thouſand of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Militia of <hi>Padua</hi> and <hi>Treviſo.</hi> Commiſſions were given out for great Levies in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and other ultramarine Countries; the Fleet alſo was aſſembled and ſtrengthened. The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> received
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53750:174"/>
into ſervice with a great ſalary, and with the obligation to levy, as there ſhould be occaſion, ten thouſand men, was ſent to be aſſiſtant to the General. With theſe proviſions the Town being preſently ſecured from all attacques, nothing remained but to reſtrain the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> plundering of the Country. For that purpoſe were drawn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Body at fit places Souldiers in pay, together with Peaſants, and <hi>Marco Giuſtiniano,</hi> Proveditor beyond the <hi>Mincio,</hi> taking the field with four thouſand Souldiers incamped at <hi>Lonato,</hi> greatly incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the people; ſo that the <hi>Dutch</hi> in ſeveral Encounters and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places being repulſed and beaten, leaving Garriſon in <hi>Valezzo,</hi> returned at laſt into the <hi>Mantuan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Republick having an eye on that ſide on what might be needful, orders <hi>Erizzo,</hi> that by ſome way or other, and at any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, he ſhould caſt into <hi>Mantua</hi> a thouſand Foot with a hundred Horſe and ſome money. But it being neceſſary to concert with the Duke the way of their getting in, he, with various pretexts, to the great difficulty interpoſed yet greater, in ſuch ſort, that <hi>Eſtré</hi> had a vexatious life of it, ſeeing him by the ſuggeſtions of ſome, that held a conſtant Correſpondence with the Imperialiſts, diſpoſed to ſome agreement, and to receive a Garriſon in <hi>Porto.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Miniſters repreſented lively to him; <hi>That by ſeparating his particular from the general Treaty, he deprived himſelf of the Warranty, which the Authority of</hi> France <hi>alone was able to afford him, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the League, for the aſſurance of that which ſhould be promiſed him; and that recourſe to Friends being for ever excluded by ingratitude, and having once received the yoke of Garriſons, it would be no more in his power to regulate the numbers nor the burdens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke at laſt, after having ſome days wavered amidſt various counſels, conſents to receive the new Succours. There happened a great diſpute about the difficulty of the way, and about the plague, ſpread through all the Country of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> with ſo great terrour and mortality, that counſels were very often confounded in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. Howeſover <hi>Marco Giuſtiniano</hi> advances with his men to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, and having made ſome <hi>German</hi> Troops to remove from <hi>Caſtiglione delle Stivere,</hi> who attempted to inveſt that place, poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Caneto;</hi> but the Caſtle making reſiſtance, and many men coming ſuddenly to its ſuccours, he retired. It not ſucceeding to put in men in a Body, it was hazarded to get them in by Parties. Some from the Confines of the <hi>Veroneſe</hi> entred; other two hundred and fifty conducted by Captain <hi>Carlincane,</hi> being attacqued by the way, were diſperſed, yet not in ſuch ſort, but that ſome few arrived ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a ſmall portion of money, which in gold they carried on their backs. From the ſide of <hi>Breſcia, Giuſtiniano</hi> ſent the Cavalier <hi>Gori,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> with two hundred and fifty Foot more, who, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating upon the way ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Guards, arrived happily there.</p>
               <p>But humane proviſions being of no force againſt the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heaven, although the Chevalier <hi>de la Valetta,</hi> with his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and with <hi>Sciabant</hi> eſcaped out of Priſon from <hi>Goito,</hi> related,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53750:174"/>
that the <hi>Germans</hi> prepared Ladders, Bridges, and Petards, which probably were to be uſed in the ſurpriſal of <hi>Mantua;</hi> nevertheleſs, the City negligently guarded, or rather treacherouſly ſold, felt the night after, the 18. of <hi>July,</hi> its cruel deſtiny. The <hi>Germans</hi> coming near without noiſe, in the ſtillneſs of the night, to the <hi>Lake</hi> at the Poſt called <hi>de la Palata,</hi> ſet down there certain ſmall Boats brought upon Waggons; a Guard of <hi>Venetian</hi> Barks armed, that was near, taking no notice of it, becauſe it was commanded by him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed the place, that they ſhould not ſtir that night, though they ſhould hear a noiſe, becauſe Succours was to be brought in. So that a ſmall number paſſing at firſt without diſturbance, and they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being increaſed, by the Boats paſſing to and again, they with a Petard flung down the Gate of the Caſtle, where the Duke with a Guard only of his own Souldiers was and <hi>Etré</hi> lodged. Upon the firſt Alarm, <hi>Durant,</hi> who had his Quarter near to the Gulph of St. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> would have gone out to fall upon the <hi>Germans</hi> at the place where they imbarked; but finding the Keys hidden, and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition carried away, was deprived alſo of the means to cauſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cannon or Muſkets to be diſcharged from the Walls upon the Aſſailants. Whereupon, all in fury, he ingages with <hi>Franceſco Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſino,</hi> one of the Dukes of <hi>Lamentana,</hi> who with the firſt relief of men was by the Republick ſent into <hi>Mantua</hi> and in the Siege, and afterwards had given proof of great courage, to charge the Enemy, which entred by the Caſtle and by the Gate of St. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> beaten down with a Petard; for that a Court of Guard, which on the middle of the Bridge might have hindred the paſſage, deceived by the Traitors, with the ſame order, formerly given the Boats, had given leave to the Enemy to come near to it. But <hi>Orſino</hi> was killed at the firſt Encounter, and <hi>Durant,</hi> hurt in the face, was with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen other Officers made Priſoners. Whereupon the Chiefs failing, all was peſtered with confuſion, as it happens in the actions of night, where Valour, not taken notice of, fights without reward, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe, not reproved for want of Witneſſes, is covered. The Poſt only of <hi>Predella,</hi> aſſaulted by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for a preſent diſtraction of the Forces, was by the <hi>Venetians</hi> defended; but they alſo quickly advertized by the cryes and clamour, that the Enemy, become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the City, was at their backs, were forced to yield; ſome, ſeeking ſafety in the waters of the <hi>Lake,</hi> were drowned there, the reſt, that were more in number, were cut to pieces. Thus the Garriſon was deſtroyed, thoſe that were in Arms being firſt killed in the fight, and thoſe afterwards that were without Arms; except ſome few, who preferring life and prey before honour and fidelity, joyning with the Enemy, took part in the ſpoil. The Duke with the Prince and Mareſhal <hi>d'Eſtré,</hi> at the firſt entry of the Souldiers into the Caſtle, retired haſtily into <hi>Porto;</hi> the Princeſs <hi>Mary,</hi> having ſaved her ſelf at firſt with her little Children into a Monaſtery, and being reſpected there by reaſon of her Sex and Relation to the Empreſs, deſired alſo to be brought. Not one of the Inhabitants ſtirred for defence, ſome rather applauding the Imperialiſts, and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53750:175"/>
hanging out of their houſes with lights the Imperial Eagles, thought to preſerve themſelves, but had the experience what the inſolence of a victorious and cruel Army could do; for the Souldiers making no diſtinction, and the Chiefs not regarding that inclination, which that unhappy people had nouriſhed towards the Colours and Name of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> nothing either prophane or ſacred eſcaped free from impiety, luſt, and cruelty. The pillaging laſted for three days, but will remain infamous to all Ages; for there was ſeen a direful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of all ſorts of calamity, with all the exceſſes which Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Licence ſuggeſted to Conquerours. The City, for many years increaſed in idleneſs, and nuzled up in pleaſures, became the Spectacle of deplorable miſery; Boys and Virgins were raviſhed, Churches robbed, Houſes pillaged, Fire and Sword every where, heaps of dead bodies and Arms appearing at every ſtep, with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of blood and tears.</p>
               <p>The Dukes had, in a long Peace, made a collection of precious things, with ſo much pomp, that Treaſures having been profuſely expended for oſtentation, it ſeemed now, that luxury ſerved for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Funerals of Fortune. The Palace was given to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo many Rarities and ſo much Wealth were every where found, that the value of the prey exceeds the memory of all other ſpoils whatever. Nevertheleſs the enjoyment was but ſhort; for God, the righteous Survivor of all, quickly vanquiſhes the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhers with contagious ſickneſs and untimely deaths. And it was generally publiſhed, that the Emperour himſelf, juſtly moved at thoſe execrable things, which were there committed, deteſted not only the occaſion but the effects of a ſucceſs ſo tragical, and that <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora</hi> the Empreſs deplored with tears the cruel deſtruction of the Country, and the calamity of her Fathers houſe; many preſaging that the Fortune of the <hi>Austrians</hi> would ſuffer ſhipwrack in the blood of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke, retired, as hath been ſaid, into <hi>Porto</hi> with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, was ſcarce got in, but he ſaw, as the full accompliſhment of the Treaſon, fire put to the Ammunition; ſo that there was a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to agree the day following to the delivery on conditions, that the Garriſon of the Republick ſhould depart in freedom. He and the Son, the Daughter-in-law, the little Nephews, and <hi>Eſtré,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed by two Companies of <hi>German</hi> Horſe, went into the Country of <hi>Ferrara</hi> to remain at <hi>Melara,</hi> where the Duke was ſupplied by the Republick with money to maintain him. A Prince doubly unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, becauſe to the bitterneſs of Fortune, which drove him from his Country, was added the cenſure of the World, which attributed to him ſome part of the blame, though in effect he could not be accuſed of ought, but that, ſeeing the people full of infidelity, he had his mind always perplexed with great fears, which begat in him in all buſineſs irreſolutions, diſtruſts, and ſlackneſs.</p>
               <p>Nor was Fame wanting to tax many of the Dukes Subjects, and ſome of the Family of <hi>Gonzagha,</hi> and in particular the Marqueſs <hi>Giovanni Franceſco</hi> as guilty of betraying <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Carlo</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53750:175"/>
to ſift them out; but at firſt in the confuſion of things and his want of power, afterwards reſtored to his Country by the Peace he diſſembled it, and like a new Prince, it behoved him to ſecure mens minds by ſhewing confidence in all, and receiving equally the guilty with the innocent. To <hi>Marc Anthonio Buſinello,</hi> Reſident for the Republick, liberty was given by the Capitulation with the Duke to go out of <hi>Porto,</hi> if he ſhould be found there; the Accord having been ſo haſty, that it was not known who was there, or who not. But he had with the firſt been pillaged in the City by the <hi>Germans,</hi> and kept Priſoner till the Emperour, reflecting on the exemption of his Character, orders he ſhould be releaſed. <hi>Durant</hi> and the other Officers of War got not their liberty but with great ranſom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> at this blow of the taking of <hi>Mantua</hi> greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, deplored, not without reaſon, ſo many cares, ſo much gold unprofitably inployed, ſo much blood unhappily ſpilt, and ſo many people miſerably conſumed; becauſe having at ſeveral times brought into <hi>Mantua</hi> and other Poſts fourteen thouſand of their Souldiers, they were reckoned to have all periſhed, either by the Enemy, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or diſeaſes. They were moreover in doubt, leſt the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which were in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> ſhould make a ſhew on that ſide to attacque them, ſo to divert a part of their Forces beyond the Mountains, that thoſe which lodged in the <hi>Mantuan</hi> might ſtrike them in the bowels with greater force. Howſoever accommodating themſelves to Fortune and Time, they not at all diſmayed, order the defence of their Frontiers, abandoning as of no uſe <hi>Caſtel Giufré</hi> and the other places of the <hi>Mantuan,</hi> the Fortifications being firſt demoliſhed, and the Cannon withdrawn. The <hi>Germans</hi> contented with ſo important a Conqueſt, applied themſelves only to the affairs of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> whence if they had the luck to drive the <hi>French,</hi> and lock them out of <hi>Italy,</hi> they well underſtood that the reſt would fall to their arbitrement and be their prey.</p>
               <p>The Republick thereupon had liberty to apply themſelves to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide with leſs diſorder againſt the plague, that more cruel enemy which devoured every thing without diſtinction, ſweeping away the Souldiers, the People, and the Chiefs, there being dead amongſt others <hi>Giorgio Badoaro,</hi> Commiſſary in Campo, and <hi>Marc Anthonio Moroſini,</hi> Cavalier Proveditor in the <hi>Bergamaſco.</hi> Not omitting care for the State were ſent Proveditors over health <hi>Giorgio Piſani</hi> into the Territory of <hi>Padua,</hi> and <hi>Luigi Valareſſo</hi> Cavalier, into that of <hi>Verona;</hi> whilſt in <hi>Venice</hi> alſo the diſeaſe broken out in great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, after it had for ſome time gone creeping ſlowly on, required vigilance and an infinite charge. Certainly better Rules or more punctual Orders could not be given, the publick charity and piety of private men contending with a rare example: So that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment going on in its immutable order, the functions of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Migiſtrates of the Republick were never omitted. The oldeſt Senators did not remember to have at any time ſeen the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try moleſted in ſo many parts; for no ſmall ſtorm aroſe alſo from the Sea, and there was not one of them that cauſed not trouble and required not conſtancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:53750:176"/>
                  <hi>Mary,</hi> the Siſter of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> betrothed to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> Son of the Emperour, with a numerous Squadron of Gallies and a Pomp worthy of ſo great Princes, being arrived at <hi>Naples,</hi> purpoſed to paſs to <hi>Trieſte</hi> with the ſame <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the accuſtomed Squadrons of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princeſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the way by Land through <hi>Genoua</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> was interdicted by the plague. That, by reaſon of violating the Dominion of the Sea, could not be ſuffered by the Republick, who offered all, or part of its Fleet, to ſerve for her tranſport; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> refuſed it, alledging a fear, though a falſe one, that the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ships were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the plague. The Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain</hi> believing that the Senate, diverted by ſo many cares, might poſſibly condeſcend to this prejudice, communicates to it the paſſage of the Queen with the Army of the Crown, deſiring, that if it ſhould happen to touch in the Ports of the Republick, it might receive good entertainment. But in anſwer found with weighty reaſons an open denial, whereat the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhewing diſtaſt, threatned to paſs without their conſent.</p>
               <p>The Senate thereupon ordered <hi>Anthonio Piſani,</hi> General of the Iſlands, that aſſembling and augmenting the Fleet with the Gallies of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Candia,</hi> and with ten Ships armed for this occaſion, he ſhould oppoſe their entry into the Gulph, and fight with whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever with armed Ships would dare to attempt it. At the ſame time they make the Queen a new offer to conduct her with their own Gallies, and cauſed <hi>Giovanni Peſari</hi> Cavalier, to declare at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Marco Anthonio Padavino</hi> Reſident at <hi>Naples,</hi> that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would prefer the force of Arms before the Civility of their offer, the Queen would be obliged to paſs through the Cannon and a Battel to her Wedding. The Miniſters had not the boldneſs to hazard her in ſuch an Encounter; whereupon ſuſpending the Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age till new Orders from the Courts, the Republick was afterwards deſired in an honourable way to lend their Fleet and the paſſage. She then, which was about the end of the year, arriving by the way of <hi>Abruzzo</hi> at <hi>Ancona, Anthonio Piſani</hi> receives her with thirteen nimble Gallies, and lands her at <hi>Trieſte,</hi> with ſuch treatment and magnificence, that in the ſtraightneſs of the Ships was ſeen abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained all that which every Element furniſhes for the uſe of Luxury and the honour of Greatneſs. For which the Republick in the Name of the Emperour and Catholick King received thanks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spinola</hi> had preſſed the Siege of <hi>Caſal,</hi> now brought to ſtraights; for Proviſions beginning to fail, and the Garriſon diminiſhed, being reduced to only two thouſand Foot and three hundred Horſe, no hope remained but in the Succours of the <hi>French,</hi> excepted by the Inhabitants, who although weary of ſo long vexations, retained ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs a conſtant fidelity towards their Prince. <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Duke <hi>de Maine,</hi> incouraged the defence with his preſence, but the command, the fatigue, and the vigilancy reſted upon <hi>Monſieur de Thoiras</hi> with great equality of Valour and Renown of two ſo great Captains; for if <hi>Spinola</hi> had a confidence, that at his name alone as to a fatal
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53750:176"/>
Conquerour of ſtrong places, <hi>Caſal</hi> ſhould yield the glory gotten at the Iſle of <hi>Rhé,</hi> did no leſs ſtir up the other to confirm it with moſt vigorous proofs. <hi>Spinola</hi> towards the Citadel had ſtrengthened his approaches, which in the circumference of the Camp were four, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to the <hi>Spaniſh, German, Neapolitan,</hi> and <hi>Lombard</hi> Nations, and beyond the <hi>Po</hi> cauſed to drive away the <hi>French,</hi> with the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of many, out of a Fort upon a certain Iſland which defended the Mills.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoiras,</hi> not amazed at any thing, bringing into the Citadel for its better defence ſome <hi>French</hi> Companies, tormented the beſiegers with frequent Sallies, and in one particularly upon the <hi>Lombards,</hi> killing the Count <hi>Soragna</hi> with many Souldiers, drives him out of certain Redoubts, flinging down the Works. The Enterpriſe not advancing with the ſpeed ſuppoſed, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was highly offended with <hi>Spinola,</hi> becauſe, neglecting to ſuccour him with all his Forces in his great dangers, in hopes to profit by his calamities, he had ingaged himſelf before <hi>Caſal.</hi> Wherefore the diſpatching the Abbot <hi>de Scaglia</hi> to <hi>Madrid</hi> to accuſe him and complain, was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to perſwade him to ſend him more powerful aſſiſtance, by which the Siege ſlackning, gave time to the <hi>French</hi> to ſend new Forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> under the Mareſhal <hi>de la Force</hi> and <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Momorancy.</hi> He with his Troops, which exceeded not three thouſand men, paſſing towards <hi>Pignarol</hi> to joyn with the others, was near <hi>Avigliana</hi> attacqued by the Prince <hi>Vittorio</hi> with five thouſand Foot and one thouſand Horſe in a narrow paſſage, where the groſs being paſſed beyond it, the Duke was left with only ſix hundred Foot and two hundred Horſe. But the reſiſtance of the <hi>French</hi> and the Valour of the Duke was ſuch, that he not only paſſed, but routed the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> taking Priſoner <hi>Pagano Doria,</hi> who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cavalry. The Prince ſaving himſelf with few, <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> arrives thereupon to beſiege <hi>Avigliana,</hi> which was rendred after a Siege but of eight days, <hi>Colalto</hi> having refuſed to ſend ſuccours to the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>la Force</hi> had reduced into his power <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> making the Garriſon Priſoners; <hi>Villa Franca</hi> and <hi>Poncalieri</hi> yielded to the Conquerour, and the beſt of the <hi>Austrian</hi> Forces, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched at the Bridge of <hi>Carignano</hi> to hinder the paſſage over the <hi>Po,</hi> received a great blow; for being aſſaulted by the <hi>French,</hi> and loſing a Half-moon, they abandoned the Poſt with great loſs and no leſs confuſion. Nevertheleſs the <hi>French</hi> preſſed not forward, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed amidſt the advantages of War by a moſt cruel plague. <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> now really ſerved for a miſerable ſpectacle, being made the Stage of all ſort of Cruelty, deſtroyed by the Enemies through ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and by Friends in deriſion.</p>
               <p>Amidſt ſo many and ſo grievous accidents, the Duke <hi>Carlo Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> burdened with ſixty and nine years, but much more pierced to the heart by infinite afflictions and the mocqueries of Fortune, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of <hi>July</hi> being ſurprized by an Apoplexy, dies in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigliano.</hi> Death ſurely took him in the greateſt ſtraight of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53750:177"/>
and he juſt at that time had his thoughts buſied in more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſigns. But cancelled the memory of them in the fire, burning a little before he expired many Papers, which contained, as was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged, to the prejudice of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> Intelligences and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with <hi>Walleſtain,</hi> (who was to come for the Emperour into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>) ſo much the more eaſily believed, by how much the Duke was againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for their ſcanty and longſom ſuccours the more implacably provoked; and <hi>Walleſtain</hi> above meaſure diſguſted with the Emperour, becauſe, reſolving to take from him the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Command of the Armies, he had a mind to ſend him into <hi>Italy,</hi> as into a ſpecious Baniſhment; but amidſt ſo great chaſtiſements, God ſpared <hi>Italy</hi> from ſo great ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo Emanuel</hi> was without queſtion a great Prince, brought up in the experience of the one and the other Fortune; magnanimous, perſevering, and valiant in War; vertues which might be ſaid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by ambition, luſt, and prodigality, if his very defects, dreſſed up by his lively Art, had not paſſed almoſt for things approved and commended. He directed his actions immoveably to his own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt alone, and meaſuring by the ſame ſteps profit and glory, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf highly inconſtant in his friendſhips, more than liberal of his own, greedy of what was anothers, always poor, never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; with the money of his friends he out-ſtood ſo many Wars, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Wealth of his Subjects, oppreſſed with moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Impoſitions. Nevertheleſs, exerciſing Command in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Authority in his Houſe, and among Strangers keeping up his honour, he was by all reverenced and eſteemed. In Wars ſeeking advantages, or in Peace ſowing the ſeeds of other Wars, his deſigns wanting ſucceſs rather than induſtry, as the Architect of ſo many confuſions he dyed, buried amidſt his own ruines. With his death the face of affairs was changed; for <hi>Vittorio,</hi> though of a profound, yet of a more compoſed, ambition, aſſuming the Government incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Peace; and not having with <hi>Richelieu</hi> cauſes of ſo great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but rather as the Kings Kinſman ſhewing himſelf prone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>France,</hi> would not cloſe with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nor totally ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from them. Declaring himſelf therefore to adhere to that ſide which would moſt facilitate Peace, he exhorted the <hi>Popes</hi> Miniſters to urge new Propoſitions; whereupon <hi>Mazarine</hi> had the luck in <hi>September</hi> to conclude a Truce, which though blamed, by reaſon of the conditions, by every one, was nevertheleſs by neceſſity obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all. It was to laſt till the end of <hi>October</hi> following, within which time, delivering to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the City and Caſtle of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi> they were to furniſh Victuals for the Citadel, and afterwards to have it, if within the preſcribed time no ſuccours ſhould arrive. Some imputed in this Treaty to the <hi>French,</hi> that by rendring the Town they yielded a point of ſo much honour, and left means to the Enemy to hinder the ſuccours. Others accuſed the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that hunger having reduced all to extremity, they would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented only with a part, and would for ſeveral weeks furniſh Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals to the Enemy. But by contrary motives theſe juſtified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53750:177"/>
with a ſuſpicion, that ſuccours were at hand; and thoſe by a doubt, they were not in a condition to bring it, ſo ſoon.</p>
               <p>That which truly induced the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> was the fear that <hi>Vitto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> would adhere to <hi>France;</hi> for that without expecting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, he greedily embraced before any other the Truce. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Spinola</hi> was for it in <hi>Madrid</hi> reprehended with great cenſure; which being added to the frequent reproofs, ſuffered by the occaſion of the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> and to the limited Powers, which through Jealouſie of a certain Correſpondence of his, which he officiouſly held with <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> were come upon him from <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeeing his Command reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his Honour wounded, he was afflicted in ſuch ſort, that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ill with a Delirium of mind and failing of ſtrength, retiring himſelf into <hi>Caſtel-novo di Scrivia,</hi> he departs this life within a few days. A Captain, ſaving in theſe latter days of his, always fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, but without exception always prudent. Being advanced in years, from a Merchant coming to the command of great Actions and Armies, before he had paſſed an Apprentiſhip in Arms, he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in counſel, in underſtanding, and in the executions of things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, ſuch reputation, that nothing elſe hath blemiſhed the ſplendour of his name but the envy of Strangers, whom, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to juſtifie ingratitude by ſuſpicions, he, an <hi>Italian,</hi> for the deſire alone of glory ſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spinola</hi> dead, the Marqueſs of <hi>Santa Croix</hi> takes the Command, and keeping his Troops within <hi>Caſal,</hi> waited for the time prefixed to receive the poſſeſſion of the Citadel, and the <hi>French</hi> ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves by the benefit of the Truce, prepared to relieve it. In this doubtful ſtate of things, a Peace being concluded in <hi>Germany,</hi> the news of it arrives unexpected in <hi>Italy. Ferdinand,</hi> for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the Empire and of his Houſe, held a Diet in <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> where the Electors being aſſembled, and taking courage from their Union, in their declared Judgments deteſted the War of <hi>Italy</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable and unjuſt, together with many complaints, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, at the inſtance of Strangers, without the knowledge and conſent of the principal Members of the Empire, had undertaken it. They exhorted to Peace, and offered to mediate; whereupon the <hi>French,</hi> to intereſt themſelves, and take the buſineſs out of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Arbitrement of the Emperour and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, ſent thither <hi>Monſieur de Leon,</hi> aſſiſted by Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> a Capucin, with whom <hi>Richelieu</hi> not only communicated the confidence, but it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed had in a manner imparted capacity for it. Theſe had in charge to make overtures of Peace, but much more to ſearch into the ſtate of things, foment the oppoſition of the Electors againſt the Creation of a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and with other Princes of the Empire to ſettle, according to the occaſion, thoſe agreements which a while after brake forth. King <hi>Lewis</hi> had now ſecretly treated with <hi>Sweden</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Empire, promiſing them a ſum of money; the <hi>Venetians</hi> alſo coming in for their ſhare, when it ſhould be time to be ſtirring to divert the War out of <hi>Italy.</hi> Yet they by invitation from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Miniſters, inſinuated to <hi>Pietro Vico,</hi> their Reſident with <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand,</hi>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:53750:178"/>
to ſend a Miniſter to the Diet, not without hope to ſeparate them by that means from the friendſhip of the <hi>French,</hi> diſpatched thither <hi>Sebaſtian Veniero,</hi> Procurator of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> as their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour Extraordinary; but with charge not to ſeparate from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, both in managing and concluding any Treaties. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ambaſſadour could arrive, the Peace upon the 13. of <hi>October</hi> was agreed upon in ſome ſhort Conferences betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Anthonio,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Crembs Munſter, Otho</hi> Baron of <hi>Noſtiz,</hi> and <hi>Herman</hi> Count <hi>de Queſtemberg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Articles at length were reduced; <hi>To promiſe mutually not to invade one anothers Countries, nor give aſſiſtance to Rebels or Enemies. As to</hi> Mantua, <hi>the pretenſions of the Houſe of</hi> Lorrain, <hi>for ſome kind of decency, were referred to the Emperour or to an amicable Agreement. To the Prince of</hi> Guaſtalla <hi>were aſſigned Lands of the Territory of</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua <hi>to the Revenue of ſix thouſand Crowns, to the end he ſhould renounce his pretenſions to</hi> Carlo <hi>and his Line maſculine. To the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>were ſet apart in</hi> Monferrat <hi>eighteen thouſand Crowns of annual, old, and ſtable Revenue,</hi> Trino <hi>being therein comprehended. To the Duke</hi> Carlo, <hi>who ſhould petition for it, was by the Imperialiſts promiſed the Inveſtiture of both the Dukedoms within ſix weeks, and within a while after to withdraw their Troops, except out of</hi> Mantua <hi>and</hi> Caneto. <hi>That the</hi> Spaniards <hi>ſhould quit</hi> Monferrat <hi>and</hi> Caſal, <hi>and retire out of</hi> Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont. <hi>The</hi> French <hi>in like manner going out of the Citadel of</hi> Caſal, <hi>obliged themſelves to repaſs the</hi> Alps, <hi>and to reſtore what they poſſeſſed in</hi> Savoy, <hi>except</hi> Pignerol, Suſa, Avigliana, <hi>and</hi> Briqueraſco. <hi>In</hi> Caſal <hi>the Duke had the liberty leſt to keep ſuch a Garriſon as his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had been accuſtomed to do, without jealouſie to the Neighbours, that notwithſtanding being to have its effect, which might by peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be ere this concerted in</hi> Italy <hi>for the demoliſhing of the Citadel. The Inveſtiture being diſpatched, and</hi> Carlo <hi>put in poſſeſſion, the places which were in the hands of the Imperialiſts and</hi> French, <hi>were</hi> bona fide <hi>to be reſtored, and laſt of all, the Forts in</hi> Rhetia <hi>newly built, were by</hi> Ferdinand <hi>to be razed, the Country to remain in the ſame liberty it formerly enjoyed. For the execution of all this, Hoſtages were to be given, and to be put into the cuſtody of the Pope or the Grand Duke, or ſome Prince of the Empire. The Duke of</hi> Lorrain <hi>was comprehended in this Treaty, and alſo the</hi> Venetians, <hi>they, upon reſtoring what they had taken, not to be troubled for any thing done in this preſent War; they alſo were to give their promiſe not to give any offence, and to reduce their Army to a condition of not giving jealouſie to their Neighbours; provided nevertheleſs, that before the ſigning hereof no other Agreement had been concluded in</hi> Italy <hi>to their excluſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Compendium of the Treaty of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being received with bleſſings and applauſes, met with the diſlike of many, and the blame of all. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that he in effect was obliged to pay the Charge of the War, and that his Countries were mangled and diſmembred. It ſeemed to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that though their Intereſts were ſecured, yet their conſtant friendſhip to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> in the form of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53750:178"/>
was but ill appayed. Above all, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> accuſtomed to preheminence, were inraged, to be (as little more than acceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) conſtrained to a Peace, the determination whereof they ſaw divided betwixt <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and the <hi>French.</hi> But at this time as well the Princes Contractors, as their Miniſters, had not looked at ought but their own intereſts, and to provide in ſome meaſure for their preſent occaſions, for the <hi>Emperour</hi> now felt himſelf touched to the quick with the <hi>Swedes</hi> Army, and <hi>France</hi> feared ſome imminent change within it ſelf. The King had in the end of <hi>September</hi> by a great ſickneſs at <hi>Lyons</hi> run the hazard of death; whereupon the Cardinal ſeeing, by the averſion of the two Queens and of <hi>Orleans,</hi> a furious ſtorm coming upon him, thought to compoſe Affairs abroad, hoping that if the King recovered, that he ſhould not want means to overturn all that which had been agreed. He had not for all that aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the care of the War of <hi>Italy;</hi> for the Army under the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals <hi>de la Force</hi> and <hi>Schiomberg,</hi> augmented to the number of ſix and twenty thouſand Foot and three thouſand Horſe, with Victuals for fifteen days, near the expiration of the Truce marched to bring ſuccours into the Citadel of <hi>Caſal. Vittorio</hi> was not diſpleaſed that it ſhould ſucceed, believing that with the falling of that place into the hands of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the Peace might be made more difficult, and <hi>Colaeltoes</hi> judgment and Commiſſion were differing, the Emperour deſiring, that he might make uſe of thoſe Troops againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> that by all means the Peace ſhould be made. Both therefore gave way that the <hi>French</hi> Army croſſing the <hi>Po,</hi> ſhould paſs ſecurely through <hi>Piedmont,</hi> although the Duke afar off with ſome Horſe marched on its ſide.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>French</hi> purſuing their march without diſpute, there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives a Currier from <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> which by the advice of the Peace put the Mareſhals into great perplexity, whether by advancing they ſhould break the accord, or rather halting loſe the Army for hunger in the bowels of the Enemies Country. They reſolved at laſt to go on for the ſecuring the Citadel, for which the Peace of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> had not ſufficiently provided, hoping with their appearance to bring the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſome more reaſonable agreement. Nor did that thought deceive them; for <hi>Sainte croix</hi> in a fright ſends <hi>Mazarine</hi> to meet them, offering to receive the Articles of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> and beſides fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Victuals to the Citadel for the ſix weeks, within which <hi>Carlo</hi> was to receive inveſtiture. The <hi>French</hi> perceiving the fright the Marqueſs was in, hoping by preſſing of him to draw him to better conditions, pretended that he with his Army ſhould retire out of the Town, the Caſtle, and all <hi>Monferrat.</hi> So that marching reſolutely forwards they preſented themſelves before <hi>Caſal,</hi> where the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army ſtood within their infranchment, and <hi>Colalto</hi> was come thither alſo, who, to poiſe things equally, had formerly denied the Marqueſs aſſiſtance, but now would not ſuffer that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould totally prevail. They on the other ſide of the <hi>Gattola,</hi> a very ſmall ſtream, put themſelves in Battel, and with Troops well in order, after having repulſed certain <hi>Poliſh</hi> Cavalry which came forth to diſcover, marched a round pace to aſſault the Trenches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:53750:179"/>But <hi>Mazarine</hi> taking advantage from the conſternation of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Chiefs, and magnifying the Forces and gallantry of enemy Troops, perſwaded them to conſent haſtily to the condition of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Town. Lo then he coming out of the Trenches, and with his hat and his hand making a ſign to the Troops to make a ſtand, being brought to the Mareſhals, concludes the Agreement upon the Field, in which the Armies were in a moment ſeen to paſs from fighting to peaceable meetings, and from animoſities to civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Conditions were, <hi>That the</hi> Spaniards <hi>going immediately out of</hi> Caſal <hi>and the</hi> Monferrat, <hi>the Posts ſhould be conſigned in token of honour to the Emperour, to one of his Commiſſioners, who for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould remain in</hi> Caſal <hi>with his Family only, but in ought elſe but carrying the name was not to meddle. He afterwards, the term prefixed for the inveſtiture being expired, was to depart, and the</hi> French <hi>Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons likewiſe were then preſently to go out of the Citadel, and thoſe of the Country to go in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The accord was no ſooner concluded, but <hi>Thoiras</hi> comes forth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured already by the King with the Title of Mareſhal of <hi>France,</hi> and was received with the acclamations of all the Army. Nor did the <hi>Spaniards</hi> delay to go out of it, <hi>Caſal</hi> remaining betwixt the two Armies, after having defloured the glory of two great Captains equally deſired by him that ſaved it and by him that loſt it. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon grew ſome delays in the execution of the Treaty, becauſe the <hi>French</hi> ſcarce gone twenty miles, caſt into it fifteen hundred Foot and five hundred Horſe, upon pretence that the Inhabitants were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to defend it, whilſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> lodging near might attempt to retake it. But <hi>Sainte Croix</hi> highly offended repoſſeſſes <hi>Fonteſtura</hi> and ſome other Poſts, blocking the place, which was quickly like to fall into its firſt languiſhing, becauſe the univerſal ſcarcity of the Country had not afforded means to furniſh it but ſcantily with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mazarine</hi> was hereupon obliged, though by the conceit that in his Negotiations he had advantaged the <hi>French,</hi> he was become diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> to take the buſineſs in hand again, and at the end of five and twenty days he had the ſucceſs to concert anew the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal abandoning of the Poſts. But after this retreat the <hi>Spaniards</hi> remaining armed on the Frontiers of <hi>Milan,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Chiefs, who had made a halt, prone to ſuſpicions, or pretexts, ſend thither five hundred <hi>Switzers</hi> as of a Nation free and indifferent. They being of thoſe that bore arms in their Army, <hi>Santa Croix</hi> taking it for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe and breach of the Treaty, advances with <hi>Gallus,</hi> who, <hi>Colalto</hi> being gone and dead in <hi>Coira,</hi> commanded the <hi>German</hi> Troops in <hi>Italy,</hi> to take again the Poſts. The <hi>Pope</hi>'s Miniſters being gone, the Ambaſſador <hi>Soranzo,</hi> who in his return home was come with the <hi>French</hi> Army as far as <hi>Caſal,</hi> undertook the mediation, by which the going forth of the <hi>Switzers</hi> being conſented, the Armies at laſt on both ſides went further off. There remained in the place the Duke of <hi>Main</hi> with the Commiſſary of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the Garriſon of the <hi>Monſerrins,</hi> to which in <hi>Carlo</hi>'s poverty <hi>France</hi> ſupplied. The
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53750:179"/>
Peace then of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> was in this manner executed in the <hi>Monſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> notwithſtanding that at the ſame time <hi>France</hi> blamed it; for as much as the King being recovered and returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> it was ſo far, that the contrivances framed by Queen-Mother had any force againſt the Cardinal, that he rather found himſelf no leſs by his cunning Arts, than by his ſo glorious Undertakings, advanced to a greater height in the favour of King <hi>Lewis.</hi> The favours of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reſembling a dangerous Voyage at Sea, that either brings Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack or Wealth, <hi>Richelieu</hi> having ſcaped the rocks and ſnares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came exalted with Praiſes, Honours, and Riches. The Queen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made ſo much the more impatient, broke forth at laſt into an open preſſing of the King, that he would put him out of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Court. But by ſuch Arts ſhe confirmed him in place of ruining him, becauſe <hi>Lewis,</hi> jealous of his own Authority and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, feigning as then, if not to ſatisfie her, at leaſt not to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect her, retiring himſelf afterwards for ſome days under pretence of hunting to <hi>Verſailles,</hi> cauſed <hi>Marigliac,</hi> her Keeper of the Seal, to be arreſted Priſoner, together with his Brother in <hi>Italy,</hi> as they that ſuggeſted to the Queen ſuch animoſities and counſels; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Cardinal, ſecured by greater favour, continues the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Affairs and the purſuit of his great Deſigns. The cauſes then ceaſing, for which he had ſecretly injoyned the Capucin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> upon any conditions, he feigns to be greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him and Monſieur <hi>de Lyon,</hi> that they had conſented to a Treaty, in which tranſgreſſing the bounds of the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> there was mention made of thoſe of the <hi>Empire</hi> and of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> being ambiguouſly comprehended, and the Liberty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Griſons</hi> not ſufficiently provided for. The doubt particularly vexed him, leſt upon the noiſe of ſuch a Treaty and the obligation not to aſſiſt Enemies and Rebels, the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſhould be diſcouraged, together with thoſe Princes of the Empire, to whom <hi>France</hi> had made large promiſes of aſſiſtance. He was afraid alſo, leſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſhould grow jealous, with whom he had lately renewed the League with an obligation of great ſuccours, and their reciprocal promiſe, that they ſhould not for ſeven years liſten to a Truce; not becauſe the Treaty of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> did in truth intereſt thoſe Provinces, but in doubt, leſt by frequent relapſes into agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without due conſideration had of their Confederates, <hi>France</hi> ſhould be diſcredited amongſt its Friends. It was added, that if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> themſelves, ſtartled at the Peace newly concluded betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> with opening of Commerce, and renewing the old Treaties, which for ſome years hitherwards ſeemed rather inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in name than by Arms, ſhould ſuſpect they ſhould be alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned by <hi>France,</hi> it would be no ſtrange thing, that they ſhould at laſt embrace the Propoſitions of a Truce, inceſſantly offered by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> For this cauſe the Cardinal with diligent diſpatches of Courriers aſſures all the Friends of the Crown, that the Treaty concluded without the Kings order, and contrary to the good liking of his Confederates, was diſavowed, pretending to have it qualified and mended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:53750:180"/>The <hi>French</hi> Miniſters foreſeeing what might happen, remained, under pretext to wait for the Kings Orders, in <hi>Ratisbone;</hi> and the Emperour returning to <hi>Vienna,</hi> was followed by <hi>Veniero,</hi> the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters there imploying many inſtances, that the Republick would ſign, ſeparate from the <hi>French,</hi> and cut off thoſe demurs caſt in by them. But the Senate refuſed to advance a ſtep but by concert with that Crown, although, by reaſon of the charges and calamities, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Peſt, weary rather with the War than contented with the Treaty, it deſired it might be quickly executed for the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Italy,</hi> having now by many experiences learnt, how unequal and dangerous friendſhips are betwixt States and Princes of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering conſtitution; whilſt the one proceeding with a conſtant or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in their Maxims and aims, the other either by inteſtine altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the change of Miniſters, oftentimes by paſſion, and always by the intereſts of Favourites, are obliged either to go out of their way or ſtand ſtill. But the buſineſs was carried on with many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays and difficulties; notwithſtanding which, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> preſſed by his own neceſſities, recals the Troops out of <hi>Italy,</hi> leaving then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Gallas</hi> ſome few, which took Quarters in the <hi>Mantuan,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Solferino</hi> and <hi>Caſtiglione,</hi> which had been free till now. The Affairs of the Empire began now to take a quite other plight than they had hitherto had, experiencing by a ſudden and ſtrange mutation, that in the immoderate deſires to greaten Empires, the troubles to loſe them are moſt commonly neareſt; ſuch being the deſtiny of thoſe States, which are increaſed amidſt many cares, that they eaſily ſhake with their augmented Conqueſts, and at laſt ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, periſh either by inteſtine Diviſions or foreign Aſſaults. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its own weight, to the dread of the Princes of the Empire and the univerſal ſuſpicions of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Monarchy of the <hi>Austrians</hi> began now to ſink.</p>
               <p>The beginning appeared at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> whence they hoped to draw more greatneſs; the Electors being aſſembled there by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> with pretext to apply remedy to the grievances of the Empire, but indeed to place upon the head of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Son, adorned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready with the Crowns of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> that alſo of the <hi>Romans.</hi> The Emperour was blamed by ſome, that he having the Empire ſubjected and in poſſeſſion with an hundred and thirty thouſand Souldiers, he ſhould call to them the Electors, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, trembled, but united, knowing not their own ſtrength, but their Authority and the wants of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> might reſolve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great and ſtrange reſolutions. The <hi>Protestants</hi> were much againſt the Election, <hi>Saxony</hi> eſpecially full of wrath for the Edict concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eccleſiaſtical Goods.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bavaria</hi> above all, though he acknowledged his Electoral Vote from <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> having, as the moſt powerful, ſo the greater apprehenſions, declared his Judgment more freely, provoked by great diſlikes againſt <hi>Wallestain</hi> and againſt the <hi>Austrians,</hi> ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by an under-hand League made with the <hi>French.</hi> Making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf then the Head and Author of the common complaints of the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53750:180"/>
Empire, he was the firſt that denied to proceed to the Election of a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Diet having not been called for that purpoſe, and then expreſſed himſelf; <hi>That it was not becoming the Electoral Colledge to reſolve ſo great a buſineſs, environed by Arms and armed men. That the Empire groaned under the cruel ſlavery of</hi> Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtain, <hi>who confounded all, amidſt the frighting of the Princes, and the afflicting of the People. For what ſerved ſo many Armies, when the Empire was in peace, but for ſo many Miniſters of Cruelty to that moſt ſavage Chief? That he, ſevere in execution, rigid in command, and covetous in exactions, conſumed the blood of the</hi> Germans, <hi>and extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Gold of the Provinces. That the Emperour ought at laſt to give a ceſſation to the grievances of the Country in general, and in his piety, by a ſeparation as it were more ſtrong than that of the fire, to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh at length in that metal, ſo unjuſtly drawn out of the bowels of his Vaſſals, and ſo unprofitably ſpent, the tears and blood of ſo many Innocents. That it was fit to divulge with detestation, that to the People of</hi> Germany, <hi>otherwiſe endowed with a most entire fidelity, the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Emperour was now become more odious than the cruelty of the Miniſter: That the ſighs and neglected groans of ſo many oppreſſed would at laſt make the Empire ſhake; becauſe being aſcended to Heaven, though deemed light vapours, they are converted into the heavieſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements of Lightnings and Tempeſts. Such a heavy ſcourge therefore ought now to be removed, Arms to be laid down, the Command to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from</hi> Walleſtain, <hi>and then with quiet minds and free Votes proceed to the Election of a King of the</hi> Romans. Thus did he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly expreſs himſelf, and was ſeconded by others; but in private gave great and aſſured hopes, that, giving ſatisfaction, they would all agree in the Election of <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> And now taking the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks into the Council, he made it be believed, that <hi>Wallestain</hi> being diſpoſſeſſed, and their advice aſked to whom the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of thoſe Troops, which were to remain on foot, ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that they ſhould inſinuate and propoſe the King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> By ſuch allurements the Emperour was perſwaded to disband fifteen thouſand Horſe at a blow, and the reſt afterwards by pieces, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining but few in pay, beſides thoſe which were in <hi>Italy,</hi> and a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which under the command of <hi>Torquato Conti</hi> was kept in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces towards the <hi>Baltique</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walleſtein,</hi> not being able to bear this, did his utmoſt to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to the Emperour the prejudice, which he ſaw would reſult from it; whilſt <hi>Germany,</hi> brought under by Arms, could not but by the terrour of the ſame be kept in obedience. He preſaged revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of great importance, the alienations of Princes and States, becauſe, by reaſon of diviſion in Religion many being offended, and all diſguſted, if the yoak of Iron were removed, that of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would eaſily be ſhaken off. He was wont to ſay, that it was impoſſible for the Emperour to entertain ten thouſand Souldiers, but very eaſie to maintain a hundred thouſand; becauſe the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Germany</hi> abounding not only with ſtore of people, but they alſo a warlike Nation, with ſmall Armies might diſpute not
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53750:181"/>
only paſſages, but Victuals and Quarters, whereas thoſe of greater power, making themſelves way, overcame every thing, and what with fear and what with force, by getting themſelves reputation and exacting Contributions, might feed themſelves, and withall gain honour and reſpect to the Prince. His counſel was, that ſhewing rigour and a Whip, <hi>Ratisbone</hi> ſhould be environed from far with a part of the Army, and with the reſt the Countries of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant threatned, and particularly of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to bring him to the Election by force.</p>
               <p>But the Emperour, either perſwaded that he ſhould peaceably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to his purpoſe, or not believing to be able without greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions, ſo highly to violate the Conſtitutions of the Empire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the mild before the more violent counſels. But it troubled not his thoughts a little, how to take away the command from <hi>Fridt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which he exerciſed with an abſolute power, and with ſo much the more applauſe of the Souldiery, as it was with hatred to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Wherefore he deputes, to perſwade him, the Counts of <hi>Verdem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> and <hi>Queſtemberg</hi> his intimate friends, who were received at <hi>Memminghen,</hi> and forbidden at firſt to ſpeak of buſineſs; but, after having entertained them with divers divertiſements, he hearkned to them with a mind free from trouble, and aſcribing all to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, amongſt which, beſides <hi>Bavaria,</hi> he reckoned the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and Jeſuites, foretold the evil event which would ariſe from it, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with biting taunts and jeſtings, more than with reaſons, his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Decree, but not his approbation of the Council. And refuſing every of thoſe ſatisfactions which the Emperour largely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him, except the exemption from rendring account of his paſt adminiſtration, he lays down his Command, and retires to his own eſtate, leaving it doubtful, whether he appeared greater in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe than in the quitting of it. But the Electors having obtained their deſign, ſhewed themſelves ſo much the more averſe to elect a King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as they thought themſelves leſs capable to be conſtrained to it. Now did they conſent to confer on the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> the direction of the Forces; but the Eccleſiaſticks, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to give their opinion, propoſed <hi>Bavaria</hi> for the Generalat, to the Emperours great apprehenſion, leſt that Elector aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by adding this command to the other which he already had of the Catholick League, to make himſelf Arbiter of the Empire, and in a condition to give Law to the <hi>Auſtrians.</hi> Nevertheleſs diſſembling his diſpleaſure, and rather feigning to applaud the propoſition, he propoſes ſuch conditions to <hi>Maximilian</hi> for the exerciſe of the Charge, that he diſſenting from them was the cauſe, that amidſt the difficulties and delays the project vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of things and minds, <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> invited (as hath been ſaid) by ſome, and deſired by others, enters into <hi>Germany,</hi> ſending certain Letters as his fore-runners to <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> in which he complains that the Emperour ſhould have prohibited him Levies in the Empire, given aſſiſtance to the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacks,</hi> intercepted his Diſpatches, taken his Ships upon the Sea,

               <p>From ſuch diſturbances in <hi>Germany</hi> was <hi>Italy</hi> now again obliged to acknowledge her quiet, though for ſome months it was toſſed to and fro without Peace, and without War, whilſt all parties ſeeking advantages by Treaties, and the Armies being wearied and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the War was made with treating, and the treating with Arms. The Plague depopulated whole Provinces, and in the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly (the wickedneſs of man adding Thunderbolts to the wrath
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53750:182"/>

The poiſon of their deadly &amp; abominable mixtures killed by the touch only, and was not to be avoided, whilſt the treachery was found hidden every where, by the drops of this ſo cruel liquor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſprinkled through the Churches and the Streets. The names of theſe men deſerve nothing but oblivion, the moſt juſt puniſhment of actions famous for wickedneſs. Though the imagination of the people, moved by fear, fancied many things; yet the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was diſcovered and puniſhed, there remaining yet in <hi>Milan</hi> the Inſcriptions and Memorials of the Houſes pulled down, where theſe Monſters had their meetings. But in the State of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and in the City, the malignant influence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the remedies, till the Senate vowing a magnificent Temple, under the protection of our Lady of health, ſending a rich Lamp of Gold to <hi>Loretto,</hi> and reſolving to ſollicite with the <hi>Pope</hi> the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of the bleſſed <hi>Lorenzo Juſtiniani,</hi> Patrician and Patriarch of the City, beſides publick and private Prayers, with Alms and Faſtings, God being pacified, the ſcourge ceaſed. Whereupon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the year, the City was with great ſolemnity pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed free from Contagion, but the skars remained for a long time, there having periſhed in <hi>Venice</hi> ſixty thouſand perſons, and in the State of the Republick more than five hundred thouſand. As to the Treaties, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> accepting the offer of the <hi>French,</hi> that the Peace ſhould be executed only for the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> oppoſed it, irritated by their not ſo happy ſucceſſes; and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>Olivares,</hi> far diſtant from the dangers and difficulties, was vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his deſigns had not taken effect. He ſends <hi>Feria</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Milan,</hi> with new inſtructions to diſturb rather than promote the Peace; and into <hi>Germany</hi> ſends the Regent <hi>Villani,</hi> that he might ſlacken in <hi>Ferdinand</hi> that ſpeed with which he drove on the Peace in <hi>Italy;</hi> offering againſt the <hi>Swede</hi> vaſt aſſiſtances, if putting <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands, he would leave to them the care of the War on this ſide the Mountains. But the Emperour reflecting on the iſſue of paſt Councils, and ſeeing the fire of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Arms blazing throughout <hi>Germany</hi> with moſt devouring Flames, ſent <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> power to conclude and execute the Peace in <hi>Italy.</hi> The meeting was held in <hi>Chievaſco,</hi> a Town of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> whither with the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Popes</hi> Miniſters, and the Duke <hi>Vittorio</hi> being preſent, <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> came, together with the Mareſhal <hi>Thoiras,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>de Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient</hi> deputed from <hi>France,</hi> to whom <hi>Trajano Viſcardi</hi> in the name of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> had yielded the Plenipotence.</p>
               <p>For the Republick <hi>Girolamo Cavazza;</hi> their Secretary, aſſiſted, and for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the Count <hi>della Rocca,</hi> their Ambaſſador in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> who took a greater ſhare in the underſtanding than manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Treaties. Theſe publick Negotiations were facilitated by ſome very private concerts betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards,</hi> till the concluſion whereof, <hi>Servien,</hi> though in appearance for ſomething
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53750:182"/>
elſe, had retarded his appearing at <hi>Chievaſco.</hi> And the promoter and mediator, not without the ſecret conſent of the <hi>Pope,</hi> was <hi>Julio Mazarini,</hi> who for his happineſs in paſt Negotiations gaining cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and giving greater hopes, having by various arts reduced <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cirollo</hi> to the alone name and appearance of the miniſtry, had with great applauſe, and with ſo much more confidence with <hi>Richelieu,</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the reality of the moſt important Affairs. He in ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences declares to the Duke <hi>Vittorio, That vain was that hope with which he was poſſeſſed, to recover by the Peace, what the Crown of</hi> France <hi>poſſeſſed of his. That the Cardinal, ambitious of glory, would what ever came of it, retain in</hi> Italy <hi>a memorial of his great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous actions. And who was there, that could hinder that deſign of his, if</hi> Ferdinand, <hi>having great troubles upon him, had no thought but of his own defence? That the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>low in reputation and Forces, mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only their own advantages, had neither the power or the will to repair the loſſes of</hi> Piedmont. <hi>The</hi> Italians <hi>unanimouſly foreſaw the power for the future divided betwixt the two Crowns, not to ſuffer the arbitrement and jealouſies of one of them alone. He himſelf might now from paſt dangers ſufficiently comprehend, what was the price of his Peace, and Principality. That he was to compare the relinquiſhing of one Town with the moſt certain conqueſt of</hi> Savoy, Tarentaſia, Moriena, Avigliana, Suza, Saluzzo, Bricheraſco, <hi>with ſo many Vallies, Forts, and other places, as rend</hi> Piedmont <hi>into bits, and beſiege the Metropolis it ſelf. And when did he think to drive away the</hi> French <hi>by force, who by their nearneſs are able to over-run the Country, and by their courage and power ſwallow the reſt? Could he peradventure expect ſuccours from the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>who, under the title of protection, would uſurp others of his places? He had no way then, but to ſacrifice to the unſatiable deſire, the Cardinal had of glory, one little part, as</hi> Pignerol <hi>might be ſaid to be; becauſe the reſt being reſtored, there would not one day want opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to recover that alſo, it being an eaſier matter to weary the</hi> French <hi>by giving way to the keeping of their Conqueſts, than by reſiſting. But there were offered at preſent conſiderable advantages, whilſt the diviſion of</hi> Monferrat <hi>being to depend upon the arbitrement of the Miniſters of that Crown, there might be given to him, together with</hi> Trino, <hi>ſo am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a ſhare, that the worth of</hi> Pignerol <hi>might be ſufficiently recompenſed; That that was the very thing which his Father had for many years, and amidſt ſo many troubles, ſought for. Nor could the Duke of</hi> Mantua <hi>complain; becauſe, if the Crown, at the price of its own Conqueſts, cauſe his capital City to be reſtored, having preſerved</hi> Caſal <hi>by its treaſure and blood, what leſſer gratitude can be returned to ſo magnanimous a King, than by paying the price of that paſſage, which for his own ſafety and aſſiſtance he deſires may be kept for future accidents?</hi> Vittorio <hi>was to weigh the preſent conjunctures, and his own intereſts; becauſe if he ſhould not conſent to yield</hi> Pignerol, France <hi>remained not only in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that place, but of moſt ample Conqueſts made in</hi> Savoy <hi>and</hi> Piedmont. <hi>That</hi> France <hi>was now the Arbiter of Peace or War: Its power and authority extended into</hi> Caſal. <hi>For</hi> Mantua, <hi>it was not ſo much taken care of, being far from its Confines, and ballanced by great
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53750:183"/>
Conqueſts, with which it could liberally both compenſate the loſſes of him that had depended on him, and overcome the advantages of the</hi> Spaniards.</p>
               <p>The Duke was wavering amidſt his troubled thoughts; for on the one ſide the deſire of Peace allured him, and the hopes to recover by Treaty that, which by other means he was not able to get again from the <hi>French;</hi> on the other, he well underſtood, that giving up the cuſtody of the <hi>Alps</hi> and paſſages into <hi>Italy,</hi> his friendſhip would no more be valued by the Crowns. At laſt yielding to the neceſſity, and to the time, he conſents to part with <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and the Vallies, which are ſerviceable for paſſage into <hi>Italy,</hi> with ſo much circumſpection and ſilence, that the effect appeared certain Months before any thing tending towards it was known. The Miniſters af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Treaty being all come to <hi>Chievaſco,</hi> the agreement for the execution of the Peace of <hi>Italy</hi> was upon the ſixth of <hi>April</hi> without much ado concluded: for, the longeſt and moſt difficult point being the liquidation of the Lands of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> which were to be given to <hi>Vittorio,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> gave way to all advantage of the <hi>Savoyards, Gallas</hi> not diſſenting, who deſired to make a ſpeedy concluſion, and, the <hi>Mantuans</hi> not oppoſing, being deſirous to reſtore the Duke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt important of his Countries. For the fifteen thouſand Crowns then of yearly Revenue, which was given to <hi>Savoy,</hi> they aſſign, beſides <hi>Trin</hi> and <hi>Alba,</hi> eighty other Villages of the beſt: That Duke taking upon himſelf the Dowry of <hi>Margherita,</hi> and, for the overplus of Revenue, which might ariſe, promiſing to depoſite in <hi>Lyons</hi> Jewels or money. The inveſtiture of this part of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> the Emperour was to give to <hi>Savoy;</hi> the nomination to the Abby of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadio</hi> was left to <hi>Mantua,</hi> and the <hi>Savoyards</hi> obliged themſelves to permit a yearly draught of ten thouſand Sacks of Grain to <hi>Caſal,</hi> which without the help of the moſt fertile part of <hi>Monferrat</hi> might eaſily fall into want. As to the reſtitution of places poſſeſſed, little elſe was added to the Treaty of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> but that in <hi>Suſa</hi> and <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliana</hi> there ſhould remain Garriſons of thoſe <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Helvetia</hi> which were confederate with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> with condition to deliver them again to <hi>France,</hi> in caſe that on the day prefixed the <hi>German</hi> Troops ſhould not be retired out of <hi>Rhetia.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> were comprehended in <hi>ampliſſima forma,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> obliged themſelves to ratifie the Treaty, and to withdraw their Army into the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> without offering offence, or giving jealouſies to thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which had had no part in the preſent War.</p>
               <p>The Treaty was no ſooner concluded, but the <hi>Germans</hi> ſilently abandoning <hi>Valezzo,</hi> retired out of the State of the <hi>Republick,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that a little before a certain caſual accident had in ſome ſort exaſperated mens minds; whilſt a party of <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe, which had ſerved under the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> paſſing through the way cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Steccato,</hi> heretofore mentioned, betwixt the Confines of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo</hi> and <hi>Crema</hi> were aſſaulted by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Guards, who killing and taking ſome, made prey of their goods and money. But upon the complaint of the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Aldringher,</hi> they were
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:53750:183"/>
releaſed, and the Booty reſtored. More vehement were the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of <hi>Feria</hi> for the things concluded in <hi>Chieraſco,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that denying to approve them, and to have powers for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, he ordered proviſions, ſought pretexts, croſſed the march of the <hi>Germans</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and invited <hi>Ottavio Piccolomini</hi> to remain in his pay with three Regiments of that Nation, and laſtly fomenting the diſguſt of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> at the unreaſonable dividing of the <hi>Monferrat,</hi> promiſed him, if he would adhere to the <hi>Austrians,</hi> not only to reſtore him in the <hi>Mantuan,</hi> but to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh him in every one of thoſe places, which the <hi>French</hi> ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally alienated from his States; but <hi>Carlo</hi> deeming it too dangerous to paſs from hatred of ſo freſh a date to friendſhips ſo ſuſpicious, contenting himſelf with complaints and proteſts in ſecret, believed, that it was not for him to diſturb the execution of things agreed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> obſerving the workings of <hi>Feria,</hi> ſtop their march from going out of <hi>Italy;</hi> whereupon the Popes Miniſters were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to interpoſe anew, and becauſe the point, which moſt galled the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> conſiſted in the ſtay of the <hi>Switzers</hi> in <hi>Suſa</hi> and in <hi>Avigliana,</hi> it was on the 19. of <hi>June</hi> agreed, <hi>That either all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions ſhould be made to</hi> Savoy, Mantua, <hi>and the</hi> Griſons, <hi>upon one and the ſame day,</hi> viz. <hi>the</hi> 20. <hi>of</hi> Auguſt, <hi>or that upon the ſame day ſhould be quitted by the Imperialists the Forts of</hi> Rhetia <hi>and</hi> Briche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſco <hi>by the</hi> French. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the</hi> 26. <hi>ſhould be releaſed to</hi> Savoy, Suſa <hi>and</hi> Avigliana, <hi>and to</hi> Mantua, Porto <hi>and</hi> Caneto. <hi>Then the firſt of</hi> September <hi>the City it ſelf of Mantua ſhould be rendred to its Duke, and</hi> Pignarol <hi>delivered to</hi> Vittorio.</p>
               <p>This laſt way as the moſt ſecure was choſen, and Hoſtages were added; and becauſe the Pope, to whom they were to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would not intereſt himſelf in that which concerned the <hi>Griſons,</hi> it was concluded, <hi>That for</hi> Bricheraſco, Thoiras <hi>ſhould be given to the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>and for the Forts of</hi> Rhetia, Gallas <hi>to the Duke of</hi> Mantua. <hi>It was beſides determined, that by</hi> Feria <hi>ſix thouſand Foot and one thouſand Horſe ſhould be ſent away out of</hi> Italy, <hi>and the</hi> Milaneſe <hi>be afterwards diſarmed, except but of ordinary Garriſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reſtitutions at their times gradually executed, gave great ſatisfaction and no leſs hope, that <hi>Italy</hi> might at laſt breathe after ſo many calamities; and the Pope wrote to the Republick a Brief with worthy expreſſions, exalting their deſervings, both in maintaining the War, and promoting the Peace. In the mean time while the reſtitutions were in doing, <hi>Monſieur de Razzilier,</hi> arriving in the Name of King <hi>Lewis</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> did not only communicate the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord concluded, but inſiſted with great earneſt, that the Republick would aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> with means to re-enter into his Country, repreſenting his preſent condition to want counſel, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and aſſiſtance: <hi>That he returned from Baniſhment and Poverty to a Principality, but brought nothing with him but his Perſon, his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and his Name, without Souldiers, without Credit, and without Money. The City of</hi> Mantua <hi>was miſerably reduced into the form of a Skeleton, the Towns into Deſerts, and the whole Territory into great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53750:184"/>
Was it any ways poſſible to raiſe Garriſons and Revenues out of Aſhes and Sepulchres? It was therefore neceſſary to garriſon thoſe Walls, for the preſervation and reſcue whereof, ſo much gold, ſo much labour, and ſo much blood had been ſpent.</hi> France <hi>being far off, had in</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua <hi>no other interest but that of affection and care. The keeping of it therefore belonged to the Republick as a Neighbour. That ſhe was to be careful not to believe too much in the Peace, becauſe thoſe are the moſt certain blows which throw themſelves upon us under the Cloak of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. That the danger of the War had been perhaps leſs than that which ought to be feared at preſent from Treacheries. The</hi> Spaniards <hi>being no longer able to oppreſs the liberty of</hi> Italy <hi>by force, would now be attempting it by Art. And if</hi> Mantua <hi>ſhould by ſome deceitful trick be taken, what elſe would it be but to wound</hi> Italy <hi>again in the ſcar ſcarce healed, to make it incurable and more painful? The King charged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with</hi> Caſal, <hi>nay with the univerſal care of</hi> Italy; <hi>promiſing, on any danger of that Country, any attempts of its Enemies, any notice from the Confederates, to deſcend again the</hi> Alps <hi>with puiſſant Forces. He that was the Author of the Peace would be the Guardian of it; intreated the Republick to cooperate with him in ſo generous intentions, and if ſhe had been his Companion in the War, ſhe would have the ſatisfaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides with him to maintain the Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> after ſo long diſturbances, infinitely deſirous of quiet, were in a doubt, leſt upon new emergencies and the news of introducing Garriſon, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> taking Jealouſie might diſturb the Peace. They were beſides perſwaded, that the Duke drawing ſome relief from his Eſtate in <hi>France,</hi> might ſupply his preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, with which they hoped at laſt that the Councils of <hi>Spain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moderated by events, <hi>Italy</hi> was to enjoy a long and ſecure tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. For this cauſe they excuſe themſelves from lending the Duke new aſſiſtance, nevertheleſs promiſing, if other diſturbances ſhould ariſe, to concur with the vigilance and readineſs uſual in their ancient Cuſtoms, together with the Crown, for the relief of him and the common Liberty of <hi>Italy.</hi> But the Dukes neceſſities not at all yielding to theſe conſiderations, nor the Kings inſtances ſlackning; but the Mareſhal <hi>Thoiras</hi> being ſent Ambaſſadour Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, to give weight to the buſineſs by the quality of a perſon ſo famous, he repeats with great urgency, that the Republick, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving even in his utmoſt calamity aſſiſted <hi>Carlo</hi> with a careful libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, would alſo compleat the kindneſs by giving him means to enjoy his preſent better Fortune. The Senate reſolved for that time only to diſband upon the Borders certain Foot, that the Duke taking them into pay, might be accommodated with them; but in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Feria</hi> not diſbanding, and it being diſcovered, that by the means of the Commander <hi>Collredo,</hi> he perſwaded the Duke, rejecting the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetian</hi> Garriſons, to admit into <hi>Mantua</hi> thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> with offers of vaſt recompences, and there happening in <hi>Goito,</hi> juſt at the time it was to be reſtored to the State, the death of the Eldeſt Prince, without leaving other Iſſue than a Son in Swadling-clouts and one Daughter, the <hi>Venetians</hi> determined to prevent every trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:53750:184"/>
accident,, to ſend to the Duke, under the Command of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco Martinengo,</hi> a thouſand Foot and two Companies of Horſe with Ammunition, and all that was elſe needful. Jealouſies afterwards increaſing more and more, they brought in four hundred other Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, <hi>Monſieur de Tavanes</hi> aſſiſting by the Duke to give him the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appearance and reputation by the protection of that Crown. Nor were the ſuſpicions ill grounded; for <hi>Feria</hi> having not ſucceeded to bring the Duke by Treaty to his ends, attempted more ſecret contrivances, and had ſent to <hi>Mantua</hi> the <hi>Infanta Margaret,</hi> under pretext to conſole the Widdowhood of the young Princeſs, her Daughter, but in effect to ſow Diſcord, ſuggeſt Marriages, form Parties, that by dividing the Houſe and the Government, a way miht be opened to ſome diſorder.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Duke of <hi>Main</hi> being dead in <hi>Caſal,</hi> in the ſo tender age of the little Prince, new jealouſies, deſigns, and hopes were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to ariſe for the Succeſſion. But <hi>Feria,</hi> by more compelling apprehenſions, was forced to lead his thoughts elſewhere; for when he thought the <hi>French</hi> gone out of <hi>Italy,</hi> he diſcovered a Garriſon in <hi>Pignarol,</hi> and the Colours of that Crown diſplayed. All followed in order to the fore-related Treaties, for pledge whereof was the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> gone to <hi>Paris</hi> under the ſhew of fulfilling them. But the <hi>French</hi> making ſhew of a ſuſpicion, that the Governour had no intention ſincerely to obſerve the agreement, complained that he did not diſarm, and that he kept ſome <hi>Germans</hi> of <hi>Schomberg</hi> in his pay, notwithſtanding that it was alledged by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that that Regiment in particular belonged to the Crown, under whoſe Colours it had long before born Arms, and that in the proceſs of the paſt Negotiations, having made mention of it to the Popes Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they had obtained of the <hi>French</hi> in expreſs terms, that that was not underſtood to be comprehended amongſt thoſe Troops which were to go out of <hi>Italy.</hi> But they, who ſought for excuſes and pretexts, ſhewing themſelves not at all ſatisfied, feigned to demand, for the keeping of a ſecure paſſage open for their return into <hi>Italy,</hi> a place of the Duke <hi>Vittorio.</hi> And he diſſembling what had been agreed, in a mocquery to <hi>Feria,</hi> communicates to him the requeſt, and at the ſame time, though it obliged him to deny it, demands of him aſſiſtance; but in ſuch a number, and within a time ſo ſhort, that he could not be able to give it him. The Governour defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf partly with great complaints, and partly with various and ambiguous anſwers, the Duke taking pretext from the delays and denial, publiſhes, that he had conſented to yield to preſſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and deliver <hi>Pignarol</hi> for ſix months to the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a little while after a new Treaty was divulged, in which it appeared, that that Town with the Vallies adjacent was ſold to the Crown in perpetuity, and that the price of it was that money, (which amounted to five hundred thouſand Crowns) which <hi>Vittorio,</hi> for the ſatisfying of <hi>Mantua,</hi> being to depoſite in <hi>Lyons,</hi> the King now charging himſelf with that debt, took it upon himſelf. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon really, at the executing of the Treaty, did
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:53750:185"/>
go out of <hi>Pignarol,</hi> and afterwards went in again, after that the <hi>Savoyards</hi> for the freeing of the Hoſtages gave aſſurance, that the place was delivered; or whether a part did not remain in the Cellars or in ſubterranean places hidden, was then much and doubtfully talked of; but time hath at laſt diſcovered, that the <hi>French</hi> not truſting the quitting of the place entirely, one part only went out, and another remained ſecretly within, and the Count <hi>de la Rocca,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Turin,</hi> who would have gone thither to ſee the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual delivery, was diverted by <hi>Mazarine</hi> by the fear of the Plague, making him believe, that it raged much and mortally in that place. This action moved on a ſudden the minds of all <hi>Europe,</hi> and chiefly in <hi>Italy,</hi> many at ſo great a novelty ſtanding amazed, others in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, others contented, according to affections and intereſts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who for want of power had till now kept in their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> breathed again deſires and hopes of alterations and changes. On the other ſide, he that in the preſent ſtate of things found himſelf at quiet, equally fearing a yoke and aſſiſtance, preſaged new and more laſting calamities, if it ſhould remain in the power of the unquiet and head-long Genius of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, unſeaſonably to diſturb <hi>Italy;</hi> but others that deſired to ſee it in an equal ſtate of liberty and ſecurity, highly rejoycing, that that Crown alſo was come in for a ſhare, perſwaded themſelves, that what with reputation, and what with the terrour of the name, it was like to preſerve her peaceable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richelieu</hi> had reaſon above any other to rejoyce, the Arbitrement of Peace and War being now put into his hand, and having mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly revenged himſelf of <hi>Olivares,</hi> who, if with clandeſtine blows, ſowing factions and diſcords in the Kingdom and in the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily he had endeavoured to ruine him, he on the other ſide, by ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal advantages in Negotiations, and upholding himſelf by Arms, had diſcredited and confounded him. In theſe two was lodged the Deſtiny of <hi>Europe,</hi> now openly become Rivals in ambition, envy, ſtrife, and hatred, to ſuch a degree, that the World could no longer bear them either at odds or agreeing without great deſtruction. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeemed highly moved, ſeeing the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to their ſhame eſtabliſhed in his Countries, and both by inclination and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude adhering to <hi>France,</hi> he of <hi>Savoy</hi> conſtrained to depend upon the ſame Crown, and the <hi>French</hi> with Reputation and Forces fixed in <hi>Italy,</hi> to give jealouſie and diſpute the predominancy till now by them enjoyed. And for this cauſe they made their complaints in all Courts, amplifying in words, that <hi>Richelieu</hi> had deluded pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, Conditions were broken, and the Peace diſturbed. But complaints being vain in an Age wherein Intereſt gives the Law, <hi>Feria,</hi> beyond meaſure in diſorder for that, having formerly by poſſeſſing the <hi>Valteline</hi> with ſo much labour endeavoured to ſhut up every paſſage into <hi>Italy</hi> from Strangers, the Gate of the <hi>Alps</hi> was now in his Government ſet wide open by the <hi>French,</hi> armed with great diligence, and from <hi>Naples</hi> and the other Kingdoms drew men and money; and to the end to diſcover affections in ſo great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:53750:185"/>
of things, he preſſes the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> for their obliged aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as if the Invaſion of the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> were near at hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richelieu</hi> nevertheleſs had not as yet brought things to that paſs at Court, nor ripened his deſigns abroad ſo as to be able openly to break with <hi>Spain;</hi> but laying hold of advantages, his aims were to make himſelf Maſter of Avenues and places of conſequence. <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> by this means open to the Arms of the <hi>French,</hi> he contrives to exclude ſuccours by the way of the <hi>Griſons</hi> to the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> out of <hi>Germany.</hi> But it being difficult without the joyning or at leaſt the making uſe of the Frontier of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to maintain an Army in that Country, he ſounds them to joyn to three thouſand of the Kings two thouſand of their Souldiers, propoſing <hi>Rohan</hi> General over all, under the title of preſerving thoſe Poſts and the Liberty of the Country; but chiefly to prevent the deſigns of <hi>Feria,</hi> leſt to be quit with him for <hi>Pignarol,</hi> he might elſewhere and particularly in <hi>Rhetia</hi> direct his craft.</p>
               <p>The Senate intent upon Peace, and doubtful leſt the ſpight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Crowns ſhould proceed ſo far as to be the cauſe of a new War, did not only refuſe to cooperate there, but in all the Courts made it their buſineſs by effectual offices to remove what was obſcure, and aſſure the Peace. Howſoever <hi>Rohan,</hi> without expecting leave from <hi>Venice,</hi> departs, and going into <hi>Helvetia</hi> among the Proteſtant <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi> where, by reaſon of conformity of Religion he was in great eſteem, he applies himſelf to diſpoſe things for the future deſigns, whilſt in the <hi>Griſons, Monſieur de la Lande</hi> raiſing with money from <hi>France</hi> three thouſand Souldiers of that Country, fortifies the <hi>Steich,</hi> and guardes other Paſſes. <hi>Feria,</hi> to oppoſe him, ſends into <hi>Rhetia Caſati,</hi> advances Troops to <hi>Como</hi> and the Confines of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> ſolliciting the Archduke of <hi>Insbruck</hi> to poſſeſs in the County of <hi>Bormio</hi> the Poſt of <hi>Sainte Maria</hi> to keep the Communication with the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> open, and inciting the Emperour to be ſenſible of ſo great an emergency. But <hi>Leopold</hi> admoniſhing the three Leagues to abſtain from unſeaſonable novelties, would not by proceeding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther procure himſelf diſturbance; and <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> in the declination of his own Intereſts, takes little notice of the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to pleaſe the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and redeem for a time the prejudices to form ſecretly a Decree, by which he declares the Inveſtiture null, granted to Duke <hi>Carlo,</hi> in caſe of tranſgreſſion in the Peace of <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</hi> As to the reſt, exhorts the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to ſufferance, and to aſſiſt with all their Forces the common Cauſe, which in <hi>Germany</hi> was running a hazard. <hi>Feria</hi> for this, and alſo underſtanding the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant defeat, which near <hi>Leipzich</hi> the <hi>Swedes</hi> gave the Emperor, was obliged to ſuſpend his motion, and to defer the reſentments to more proper Conjunctures and time.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the year there had been publiſhed in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Camp at <hi>Berwald</hi> the League betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Guſtavus</hi> for the defence of their common Friends, ſecurity of the Commerce of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, and reſtoring of Liberty in <hi>Germany</hi> and the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> Theſe were obliged to proceed in their enterpriſe with thirty
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53750:186"/>
thouſand Foot and ſix thouſand Horſe, and <hi>that,</hi> to diſburſe to them four hundred thouſand Ricks Dollers by the year. They had condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, that in the places which ſhould be taken, Religion ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as the Peace appoints, which they call the Religious Peace in the Empire, and where the Catholick was, the Worſhip ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main free. The <hi>Swede</hi> during the Winter made ſufficient progreſs, for that the Souldiers, by reaſon of the natural coldneſs of the Clime, equally ſtrong in body and mind, made light of hardſhips; ſo that in a ſhort time were taken in, not without ſome diſpute, <hi>Griffenhag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hen, Gartz, Damin,</hi> and other places, amongſt which was <hi>New-bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi> re-taken a while after by <hi>Tilly,</hi> with the Impriſonment of Colonel <hi>Kniphauſen,</hi> that kept it, and an infinite ſlaughter of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon and Inhabitants. But the King at <hi>Franckfort</hi> upon the <hi>Oder,</hi> a Town of greater moment, was even with them; for forcing it by aſſault, he permitted that the whole Garriſon ſhould be cut to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Towns of <hi>Colberg</hi> and <hi>Landtſperg</hi> intimidated with this ſucceſs, yielded to him on conditions, whilſt <hi>Tilly</hi> in this interim was ingaged in the Siege of <hi>Magdenburg.</hi> The Proteſtants held at this time a Diet in <hi>Leipzich,</hi> and publiſhed under the warmth of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Protection thoſe conceptions, which the Emperours power had for a long time ſuppreſſed; nay they appeared the more irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for that in <hi>Swabe</hi> the Troops of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in their return out of <hi>Italy,</hi> had, as they paſſed, to ſome of that Religion done very great miſchief. The Emperour had alſo denied them to recall the Edict concerning the reſtitution of the Goods of the Church; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they reſolved to arm themſelves, and to joyn with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> imploring of the King ſpeedy and vigorous ſuccours for <hi>Magdenburg. Guſtavus</hi> denied it not; but being firſt deſirous to aſſure himſelf of the Electors of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> while they were negotiating about the delivery of the places and union of Forces, <hi>Magdenburg</hi> was taken by aſſault, deſtroyed by the Sword, and deſolated by Fire, with ſuch a ſlaughter, as was made a terrour to the Proteſtants, and a horrour to the Catholicks, to the great reproach of <hi>Tilli,</hi> who ſeemed, as is uſual to thoſe that are accuſtomed to good Fortune, to grow cruel in ſeeing himſelf abandoned to a contrariety. At laſt after reciprocal and various ſucceſſes of no great moment, whilſt <hi>Saxe</hi> armed, <hi>Tilli,</hi> to aſſure himſelf of his ends, demands of him an Union, Paſſages, and Quarters, and the Elector not complying with him, he enters into <hi>Miſnia</hi> to fright him, and having taken ſome Towns, attacques <hi>Leipzich</hi> that refuſed to receive his Garriſon. The City being of a large circuit and weak Walls, after two days yields. But <hi>Saxe</hi> thus provoked, joyns preſently the <hi>Swedes</hi> with his Army of twelve thouſand men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guſtavus</hi> judged, that to maintain credit and his conqueſts, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved him to purſue ſome new deſigns, and, without giving the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my time to unite and augment his Forces, to joyn Battel with him under the favour of his Reputation and Fortune. Nor could, the Armies being too near, <hi>Tilli</hi> refuſe it; for to retire would put him upon diſadvantage and diſhonour, and the King following him,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53750:186"/>
would have diſordered him, and beaten him without hazard. The Armies then faced one another near <hi>Leipzich,</hi> equal in valour and number, commanded by two Chiefs, that in actions of War had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inequality, ſave in the dignity. The Armies ranged themſelves into a very long Line upon a ſituation almoſt plain, a little riſing ground interpoſing.</p>
               <p>Among the Imperialiſts <hi>Tilli</hi> commanded in the middle, <hi>Firſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> on the right, and <hi>Papenheim</hi> on the left hand. Of the <hi>Swedes</hi> the King took the right Wing, and <hi>Saxe</hi> with his men had the care of the left. In the Reer of the one and the other ſtood ſome Troops of reſerve. <hi>Tilli,</hi> with the ſkill of an experienced Captain, had choſen the advantage of the Sun and Wind; but the King with an Art not at all-inferior, partly by protracting the time of the Battel, and partly by wrying his order, as he charged the Enemy, got it in a great meaſure to himſelf. With a ſoft pace then and in great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, upon the 7. day of <hi>September</hi> the Troops advance to the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, the Cannon on both ſides by inceſſant ſhooting doing conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hurt, but moſt to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who nevertheleſs immoveable, kept their order, waiting for the ſign to give on. The King at laſt gave the command to charge, and it was no ſooner given but the Troops on both ſides were ſeen to be mingled and diſordered. The lives of ſo many warlike men were now placed upon the points of their Swords, courage was encreaſed by blows, the wounded appeared in heaps, and the dead bodies were piled up a great height in the Field. In the heat of the Fight, the Chiefs themſelves were ingaged in the Battel, equalizing fortune and dangers. The Victory, it ſeemed, was uncertain, when after about an hours doubtful conflict the right Wing of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> broke and diſperſed the <hi>Saxons</hi> left. But the <hi>King,</hi> after many Charges, pierced into and diſordered the left of <hi>Papenheim,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that finding no more reſiſtance, he had the liberty (cauſing the Troops of reſerve to march) to go him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with fury to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and charge the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts with ſo much heat, that they quit the Field. And now there was no longer fighting, but ſlaughter and running away, till night coming on, the Conquerors then firſt ceaſed to purſue, and the conquered to fly. <hi>Tilli</hi> with many wounds, but very few Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers retires into <hi>Hall.</hi> The report was, that the number of the dead amounted to fifteen thouſand; the reſt were diſperſed, leaving to the <hi>Swedes</hi> the Field and the glory, with the Cannon and the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.</p>
               <p>After ſo ſignal a Victory <hi>Germany</hi> was divided as it were for a prey, betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Saxony.</hi> The <hi>Saxe</hi> choſe <hi>Bohemia</hi> with the Provinces adjacent, leaving the reſt to the <hi>King.</hi> It was no ill grounded opinion, that if the Army in a Body had advanced di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards the patrimonial Countries of the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> it would have found no reſiſtance; for that confuſion and fear ſubverting Councils, the ſpeed of the Enemy would not have given time for redreſs or defence. But <hi>Leipzich</hi> being recovered, while the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor takes in <hi>Eyra</hi> and <hi>Prague</hi> with almoſt all the Kingdom of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:53750:187"/>
the <hi>King</hi> bends towards <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Germany,</hi> and travelling ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than fighting, with a carreer of proſperity, poſſeſſes himſelf of <hi>Franconia,</hi> and of the <hi>Lower Palatinate,</hi> with the Countries of the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> and ſo many other places along the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> and elſewhere, that it almoſt appeared, that Fame had uſed leſs ſpeed in publiſhing the ſucceſs, than the King in ſubduing the Countries. He now ſends to <hi>Venice Lewis Chriſtophoro Ratſhio,</hi> Cavalier, his Ambaſſador extraordinary, to communicate his advantages and deſigns, tending to the relief of the oppreſſed, to the liberty of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the humbling of the <hi>Auſtrians;</hi> whereupon having it in his power to advance the peace and ſecurity of <hi>Italy,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded money and aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Senate honouring in officious terms the proſperity of that Prince, condeſcended not to ought elſe, but to call to memory the much which the Republick had contributed to the liberty and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Italy;</hi> over which not without care and charge it was no leſs vigilant at preſent. The diſcourſes of the felicity of theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, paſſing to this ſide of the Mountains, troubled with no ſmall fears the minds of many, and in particular of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> who very unwillingly ſaw a King ſupported by great Forces, and ſo great fortune draw near to <hi>Italy,</hi> where perhaps he might find no fewer invitations than pretexts.</p>
               <p>Apprehenſions were increaſed from Nature and from Chance; for the Mount <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> which with its burnings had, it ſeems, formerly preſaged either the inundations of people or the grievous calamities of <hi>Italy,</hi> caſt up flames with ſuch violence and aſtoniſhment, that the City of <hi>Naples</hi> was afraid either to be ſwallowed in the Earthquake, or to be buried in the aſhes. The ſhaking overturned houſes, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the courſe of Rivers, repulſed the Sea, toſſed and opened the Mountains: In ſum, there were evaporated by contrary and hideous effects Waters, Flames, and Aſhes, by which ſome neighbouring pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did not only remain covered, but it was doubted, leſt, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the air being taken away, that whole people might be ſuffocated. But Heaven being appeaſed by publick penitencies, the groans of an innumerable multitude being every where heard, ſuch a wind aroſe from the contrary quarter, as carried them to fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea as far as <hi>Cataro,</hi> and other places of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi> The ſulphureous aliment being at laſt conſumed in the bowels of the earth, the fire extinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Germany,</hi> amidſt the fears of <hi>Italy,</hi> experiencing with ſtrange viciſſitudes more ſenſible miſchiefs; the proſperity of the Emperour, which a little while ago threatned the Hereticks, could not now ſerve the Catholicks for a ſupport or countenance, becauſe from the higheſt mountain of divine judgments was let looſe that ſtone which makes the ſtrongeſt of Empires to totter. The Elector of <hi>Trier,</hi> ſeeing him of <hi>Mentz</hi> driven out of his Country, took occaſion to publiſh the protection which <hi>France</hi> had ſecretly ſome years before conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, when he, offended with the Emperour for not having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged the Abby of St. <hi>Maximine,</hi> which he pretended was annexed
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53750:187"/>
to that Crown, and now opening the Gates to his Forces puts <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtain</hi> into their hands. <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who forced to play faſt and looſe, without ſeparating himſelf from the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> but no leſs to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard himſelf with them, had likewiſe made a late Treaty with the <hi>French,</hi> in which they promiſing him the conſervation of the Electoral Vote in his Family, both the King and Duke obliged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves mutually to defend thoſe Countries, which they then poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, with a certain number of Horſe and Foot. By this alliance <hi>Richelieu</hi> obtained the ſeparation of <hi>Bavaria</hi> as head of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick League from giving aſſiſtance to <hi>Lorrain;</hi> becauſe that Duke, after the Conſpiracies with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> deſpairing of ever reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf to that Miniſter, had not only given himſelf to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>Auſtrians;</hi> but during the War of <hi>Italy</hi> had perſwaded the <hi>Emperour</hi> to fortifie <hi>Moyenvich,</hi> a place of conſequence upon the Frontier of <hi>Mets,</hi> and of the juriſdiction of that Biſhoprick, and afterward to deliver the place to him, to the end that with it he might cover his own Country, and withall upon occaſion give paſſage for the invading of <hi>France.</hi> He had afterwards received <hi>Orleans</hi> in his Country; and now though the protection which he expected from the Emperour appeared weakned, nevertheleſs provoking the King with offences, and the Cardinal with diſguſts, drew unſeaſonable troubles into his boſom. The ſaid Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> by the ſuggeſtion of the Queen Mother and of his Siſter in Law, no leſs than of his Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, taking the plauſible pretext of ill Government, of a ſudden retires from Court. The King now comprehending, that both by domeſtick and foreign encouragements his Brother went about to obtain the Kingdom in preſent rather than hope any longer for it, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him towards <hi>Orleans</hi> with ſo much ſpeed, that the Duke not willing to be taken by force, nor to truſt to any accord, departs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where with the Duke of <hi>Bellegard,</hi> Governour of that Province, he had already contrived intelligences and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The King coming thither alſo and the Cardinal, conſtrained him to paſs into the <hi>Franche Conté,</hi> and from thence to take refuge in <hi>Lorrain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis,</hi> well to ſecure himſelf firſt in the Kingdom, reforms the Court of the Queen his Wife, diſcarding the perſons ſuſpected, and forbidding the Ambaſſador of <hi>Spain</hi> to viſit her in private. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brings his Mother to <hi>Compiegne,</hi> and of a ſudden parting thence, leaves her there, kept under the care of the Mareſhal <hi>d' Eſtré.</hi> His will after was, that ſhe ſhould be removed to <hi>Molins,</hi> a Town not ſtrong, and in the heart of the Kingdom, giving her as a token of honour the Government of the <hi>Bourbonois;</hi> but the Queen inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing delays by the pretext of her weakneſs, inſinuated to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>la Chapelle,</hi> that giving her entrance, ſhe ſhould reſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the place to him; and in this confidence, whilſt the Cardinal privy to all, to facilitate her flight dexterouſly cauſes the Guards to be ſlackened, ſhe ſecretly departs. But coming to <hi>la Chapelle</hi> finds it in Arms againſt her, there being entred into it the Marqueſs <hi>de Vardes,</hi> Father of the Governour, ſent thither ſeaſonably by the
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53750:188"/>
Cardinal himſelf; whereupon entrance being denied her, ſhe was forced to paſs into the Province of <hi>Henault,</hi> and thence to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where being received with great tenderneſs by the <hi>Infanta Iſabella,</hi> ſhe ſpreads throughout the whole world the complaints of her condition; that, being driven out of that happy Kingdom, where ſhe had heretofore commanded, ſhe was now in her old age put to ſeek for entertainment, and perhaps a Grave, amongſt ſtrangers. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> hoped from theſe domeſtick broils in <hi>France</hi> great advantages, having the Mother of the King in their hand, and the Brother in the houſe of a Prince their friend. Nevertheleſs they could not with Forces proportionable to ſo great a deſign promote the diſturbances of the Kingdom, being engaged in <hi>Germany,</hi> and beaten in <hi>Flanders</hi> by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> whilſt by the <hi>Scheld</hi> they were attempting a ſurpriſe in <hi>Zealand.</hi> They ſaw <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> alſo not well provided with Forces, nor with the intelligencies they expected: for thoſe, who, as it was ſaid, were to take Arms and kindle the War in the Kingdom, being prevented by the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance and authority of the Cardinal, had been able to effect nothing, but provide for their ſafety by running away. The Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> who had in his hand the pledge of the Succeſſor of the Crown, thought himſelf ſecure; yet to bind him faſter, perſwades him to marry <hi>Margaret</hi> his Siſter, a Princeſs of great virtue and rare beauty. On the advice whereof, <hi>Lewis</hi> was inflamed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream anger, and <hi>Richelieu</hi> taking hold of the occaſion to revenge himſelf, perſwades him to cauſe the Mareſhal <hi>de la Force</hi> to inveſt <hi>Moyenvich,</hi> which the Imperialiſts being not able to relieve, nor the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> daring without their help to attempt, it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few days rendred.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Army would then have proceeded farther, if <hi>Carlo,</hi> in perſon humbling himſelf to the King, had not made this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>To renounce all intelligence and junction prejudicial to</hi> France; <hi>to cauſe the Rebels and enemies to the King to go out of his Country, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them entrance for the future, and to join to the Kings Army four thouſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe, with which entring into</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many <hi>the third part of the Conqueſts ſhould be the Dukes.

The King, to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the more <hi>Richelieu</hi> was attacqued by envy and hatred, the more he embraced him in his favour, created him Duke and Peer of <hi>France.</hi> So that by thoſe applauſes, with which, over and above the rejoycings of thoſe of his own party, fame exalted him, he vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated himſelf from certain invectives, which ſpread abroad in print by unknown Pens, came to be publiſhed by the diſcontented, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by thoſe in the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> In <hi>Venice</hi> alſo, at the requiſition of the Ambaſſador <hi>d' Avan,</hi> he was by the great Council received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Order of the <hi>Patricians</hi> with unanimous Votes.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICK OF VENICE. THE NINTH BOOK.</head>
            <p>WE ſhall now deſcribe ſome peaceable years of the Republick, rendred more joyous from the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of paſt calamities, and the hideouſneſs of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers undergone, out of which, amidſt Fire and Sword, ſhe was with ſafety and glory reſcued, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the aſſiſtance of Heaven by the conſtancy and counſels of the Citizens, rather than by her own ſtrength or the aſſiſtances of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. With theſe better times began the Principality of <hi>Franceſco Erizzo,</hi> aſſumed to be Duke, after the death of <hi>Nicholo Contarini,</hi> with great applauſe, for having through the courſe of many years aſſiſted the Country with counſel, and joyntly defended it by Arms. And becauſe he held the Generalſhip of the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> there was put into that Charge, as his Succeſſor, <hi>Luigi Giorgio,</hi> at that time Proveditor in the Army. But States being like the Sea where it fluctuates, though there be no ſtorm, there aroſe at this time ſeveral diverſities in opinion and unkindneſſes with the Pope, which, though they moleſted not <hi>Italy</hi> with Arms, diſtracted nevertheleſs mens minds with troubleſom buſineſs.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> after the death of <hi>Franceſco Maria della Rovere,</hi> the laſt Duke of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> had united to the Church that moſt noble Fief. And becauſe during the life of the Duke, who was now grown very old, he kept a Prelate in that Country, which aſſiſted in all affairs, he had after his death ſo little trouble to poſſeſs himſelf of it, that
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53750:189"/>
               <hi>Taddeo Barberino,</hi> Prince of <hi>Paleſtrina,</hi> entring into it with Souldiers to take quietly poſſeſſion of it, it looked as if the old Dominion was rather continued than another new one introduced. The Pope un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext of the Commotions of <hi>Italy</hi> was already in Arms, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting this accident, to the end that if in ſo great a confuſion of affairs any body ſhould go about to diſturb him, he might be able to maintain his right with a puiſſant Force. But the Princes rather offered him to ſtrives their aſſiſtance, and exhorted him to inveſt his Nephews with it, ſome believing to oblige him, others, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that State, deſiring that the Church ſhould not ſo much increaſe its temporal Dominion. The <hi>Pope</hi> having regard to the ſevere Bulls of his Predeceſſors, and apprehending to leave to his Houſe a Patrimony of unquietneſs and trouble, rather than a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Dominion, made ſhew to think his Kinſmen more worthy of the Principality by refuſing it, than by retaining it. He only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, as the Spoils of ſo noble a Conqueſt, upon his Nephew <hi>Taddeo</hi> the Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> a long time enjoyed by the Family of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.</hi> This dignity retains a certain ancient and venerable memory of the <hi>Praetor Praetorii,</hi> in the times of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> of ſo much eſteem and authority; though at preſent there remained nothing of it but the dreſs and the name. From hence brake forth a great diſtaſte with the Princes, becauſe the Prefect or Governour pretending pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of Ambaſſadours, who in the moſt ſolemn Functions aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Popes Chair of State, repreſenting the members of all Chriſtendom united to their head, did all diſſent from it. The <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berins</hi> attempted to gain the Emperour; becauſe from his example other great Princes would certainly depend, and they omitted not any means, offering him great ſuccours and powerful aſſiſtances. But in vain; for the Emperour, reſolving not to depart from what was fit, and complaining that Merchandize for private reſpects was made of his neceſſity, pulled upon him by maintaining of a cauſe in which Religion had the chief part, orders his Ambaſſadour to abſtain from the Churches, and the other Miniſters of the Crown followed him, conſidering the Pope in his own houſe, and in the cauſe of his Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, Uncle, and Party no leſs than a Prince. From this common diſtaſte of the Princes roſe afterwards a particular one of the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> for <hi>Giovanni Peſari,</hi> Cavalier Ambaſſadour of the Republick, meeting caſually in a ſtreet with the Prefect, who ſtopping his Coach, and the other not obſerving it, by reaſon of the obſcurity, it being now late, though he civilly cauſed an excuſe to be made for it, yet the Prefect taking offence at it, meets him another time on purpoſe, having corrupted the Ambaſſadours Coach-man, who feigning that his Hat was fallen off, ſtaid the Horſes, and run his way. <hi>Peſary</hi> was no ſooner got home to his houſe, but the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans flight was backed by ſome armed men, to reſcue him from the puniſhment he deſerved.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Rome</hi> always talking, and always greedy of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for it, meaſuring things by appearances and ſhadows, judges ſuch Formalities to be of no leſs account than bloody Battels and

The Senate, knowing that by the ſupport of the Uncle the party of the <hi>Barberins</hi> would be too ſtrong in <hi>Rome,</hi> order <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,</hi> that, for a publick reſentment, he ſhould immediately leave the City, without taking leave of the Pope or his Nephews, and at <hi>Venice</hi> they ſuſpend giving audience to the <hi>Nuntio.</hi> With this ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſguſt was interwoven, upon occaſion that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> at a time which was judged very unſeaſonable, while Chriſtendom was in a flame, and <hi>Italy</hi> deſtroyed betwixt War and Plague, had in the year paſt by his Bull decreed to the Cardinals, the Eccleſiaſtical Electors, and the great Maſter of <hi>Malta,</hi> the Title of Eminence, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them to receive any other, except from Kings. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick notwithſtanding continued to write in the ſtile accuſtomed; but ſome of the Cardinals taking occaſion from the affliction which they ſaw it would be to the Pope and his Kindred, refuſed the Letters, to the great reſentment of the Senate. There were added ſharp conteſts betwixt thoſe of <hi>Loreo,</hi> ſubjects to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Arriano,</hi> which belong to thoſe of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where the Cardinal <hi>Palotta,</hi> the Legate, diſturbing the undoubted Confines of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> by impriſonings and other miſchiefs, ſhewed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to attempt greater novelties, by erecting new high-ways, making the <hi>Po</hi> uſeleſs, and changing the courſe of the Waters.</p>
            <p>Nor were the <hi>Venetians</hi> wanting, by equal miſchiefs, to repair themſelves; but <hi>Luca Peſaro,</hi> Captain of the Gulph, entring into the <hi>Sacca di Goro</hi> with certain Gallies and armed Barques, ſtopped the Ships, which with Victuals and Merchandiſe, contrary to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Republick, paſſed by Sea towards <hi>Ferrara.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed alſo in the River the works newly made to divert its courſe; whereupon ſpirits imbittering, it looked as if things would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further; becauſe Troops increaſing on both ſides, the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks on their Confines raiſed a Fort called <hi>delle Bocchette,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> oppoſed another calling it <hi>della Donzella.</hi>

               <p>To the end this firſt heat of Arms might not proceed to greater ingagements, the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters interpoſed, propoſing a ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of offences, and that the Souldiers ſhould be withdrawn from thoſe Borders, where juſt at that time the Agreement was ready to be concluded, it hapned, that in an occaſion ſome of thoſe of the Popes were killed, and thirty three taken Priſoners, with hurt on the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſide. But the <hi>Pope</hi> and the Republick giving their promiſe to King <hi>Lewis,</hi> not to offend one another by Arms, and to remove the ſouldiery, there remained a larger field for Treaty, by which ſome of the difficulties were quieted; for as much as the <hi>Pope,</hi> affirming to Monſieur <hi>de Braſſac,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, that concerning what had hapned at <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Peſari,</hi> he had not till now

had notice of it, much leſs that his Nephew had been concerned in reſcuing the Coach-man out of his houſe, expreſſed himſelf particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly diſcontented at it, and cauſed them to be puniſhed with Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that were guilty of the offence. Declares over and above to the Cardinals, that the Republick was, as it had always been, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated with the reſt of the Kings comprehended in the excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Title of Eminence, and commanded them to receive the Letters in the wonted form. The Senate reſting ſatisfied, admitted the <hi>Nuntio</hi> to Audience, and ſent <hi>Luigi Contarini</hi> Cavalier for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ambaſſadour to the Pope. But the differences about the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as being of an ancienter date, met with greater difficulties, though to end them it was reſolved to ſend Commiſſioners on the place; whereupon from the Pope were appointed <hi>Ottavio Corſini,</hi> Preſident of <hi>Romagna,</hi> and <hi>Fabio Chigi,</hi> Vice-Legat of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and from the Republick <hi>Baptiſta Nani</hi> and <hi>Luigi Mocenigo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the meeting was no ſooner compleat, but the buſineſs was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated in the doubt, what the ancient Confines were, which by both parties had been interrupted by reciprocal acts of poſſeſſion. The Eccleſiaſticks came afterwards to lay claim to certain new-grown Lands <hi>(Alluvioni)</hi> which may in a manner be called the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcencies of the <hi>Po,</hi> where with ſeveral Streams impetuouſly pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, it breaks the Waters of the Sea, and then meeting with a greater force, ſlackning its courſe, leaves ſand and forms certain mooriſh places, which ſometimes lying bare, ſometimes covered with the ſalt water, vary according to the courſe of the Stream, and the blowing of the winds, their ſituation, extent, and proſpect. The conteſt ſeemed of no value, but the parties judged it of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, eſpecially the <hi>Venetians;</hi> becauſe it carried along with it the Rights and Juriſdiction of the Sea, the which although the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticks confeſſed belonged to the Republick, their Commiſſioners nevertheleſs contended for thoſe new parts of the Waters, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were extended beyond their Borders. On the other ſide the <hi>Venetians</hi> diſſented to treat about it, as not comprehended in their preſent Commiſſion, nor in that of 1613. when the ſame bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Confines was in debate; but without effect. So that the Commiſſioners themſelves not agreeing, no not ſo much as upon the grounds of their buſineſs, <hi>Nani</hi> falling ſick was forced to retire, and <hi>Corſini</hi> follows him, returning to his Government. <hi>Chigi</hi> and <hi>Mocenigo</hi> remained there idle for a time. The buſineſs at laſt was brought into <hi>Venice</hi> by the Mediation of the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, and the Treaty continued part of the year following, the <hi>Venetians</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring themſelves always ready to accept thoſe conditions, which with the Juriſdiction of the Sea, of the Mouths of the Rivers, and of the <hi>Sacca di Goro,</hi> preſerved the ancient Covenants with thoſe of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and the power to divert the prejudices of Ports and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, which are the veins and heart of the Capital City.</p>
               <p>Theſe differences were of ſmall moment in reſpect of the Rupture which now fatally drew near betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> kept an Army betwixt the <hi>Moſelle</hi> and the <hi>Rhine</hi> to bridle the Duke of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:53750:190"/>
                  <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that he ſhould not deviate from the late agreements, as alſo to extend his Authority in <hi>Germany,</hi> and invite the Catholicks to ſhelter themſelves under his protection. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Trier</hi> ſerved to others for an example; but the Chapter of that Church, not approving his reſolutions, brought a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon into the City. Whereupon the Mareſhal <hi>d'Estré</hi> beſieges it, and in a ſhort time taking it, the Elector was confirmed there with a <hi>French</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coblents</hi> alſo, kept by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and taken by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> was delivered to <hi>France,</hi> as appertaining to the ſaid Elector. It was notwithſtanding diſcovered, that the <hi>French</hi> now either envied the proſperity of his Arms, or feared the neighbourhood of the King <hi>Gustavus;</hi> the Mareſhal <hi>de Brezzé</hi> being thereupon ſent Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, Neutralities were propoſed for the Catholick Ligue and for <hi>Bavaria.</hi> But without effect; becauſe the <hi>Swede</hi> pretending that he ſhould wholly ſeparate himſelf from <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and for ſecurity ſhould deliver over ſome places to him, beſides the reſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and of all that which the Catholick Arms had from the year 1618. poſſeſſed, <hi>Bavaria</hi> aſſents not to it, and drew the Elector of <hi>Collen</hi> his Brother into the ſame reſolution: whereupon the King, leaving ſome Chiefs to make progreſs in <hi>Francony</hi> and <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> advances againſt <hi>Bavaria</hi> with the greateſt power of his Forces. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken <hi>Donawert,</hi> he eaſily paſſes the <hi>Danube,</hi> drawing near to the <hi>Lech,</hi> upon the brink whereof <hi>Tilli</hi> had ordered his defence. But <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> under the favour of many Cannon, paſſed it with great ſlaughter of the Catholicks, amongſt which <hi>Tilli</hi> was killed, and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringer</hi> hurt. The <hi>Swedes</hi> found, upon what to vent their cruelty by Fire and Sword, and to ſatiate their covetouſneſs with Booty in ſo flouriſhing and populous a Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Munichen,</hi> the Reſidence of the Dukes, and ſome other places, yielded with little oppoſition. <hi>Ingolſtat</hi> reſiſted; but the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received in <hi>Ausburg</hi> with incredible applauſes of thoſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, fears began to increaſe in <hi>Italy,</hi> amorouſly looked at ſo near hand by the King, as that, which as much as it renders its people with its opulence contented, ſo much by its wealth, pleaſures, and ſituation allures Strangers. The Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> in particular doubtful, leſt the King by ſending men to <hi>Rohan</hi> ſhould attempt the <hi>Valteline,</hi> ſends Souldiers to the Confines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> fearing, leſt the <hi>Swedes</hi> through <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſhould attacque his Patrimonial Provinces in <hi>Flanque,</hi> reſolves, to great miſchiefs to apply a deſperate remedy, and knowing, that together with money faith failing, and with faith credit, Armies were not to be ſet on foot without gold and the reputation of a great Captain, he recalls <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtain,</hi> who had in an equal meaſure gained Glory and Wealth, and undergone, no leſs with applauſe among the Souldiery than with ſkill, the Generalſhip of Armies, and agrees to all the conditions he could deviſe to pretend to. They conſiſted in an abſolute power, with which <hi>He ſhould order War and Peace, having the Command of all the Armies which were in the Empire, belonging either to the Emperour, the</hi>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:53750:191"/>
Spaniards <hi>or the Catholick League; that the King of</hi> Hungary <hi>ſhould not go into</hi> Bohemia, <hi>nor to the Army; that he ſhould diſpoſe of charges, puniſhments, and rewards; of quarters, contributions, and of Conqueſts; without the recovery of the Dukedom of</hi> Mechelburg <hi>he ſhould not make Peace, and in recompence of his merit and charges, ſome one of the hereditary Provinces ſhould be aſſigned to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſum, the Empire was divided betwixt <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Walle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi> but with this difference, that the General, without expecting commands, had power to do every thing, and the Emperour could only command that which the other was not pleaſed to do. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from that very time it was judged, that neither the one would be contented to remain a private man, nor the other as a Prince would be long able to ſuffer him. He applying himſelf in <hi>Moravia</hi> to raiſe an Army, eaſily compleated it, Souldiers flocking from all parts to his reputation and pay.</p>
               <p>Nor did <hi>Saxony</hi> give him the leaſt diſturbance, intent only upon Conqueſts in <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Sileſia;</hi> and perhaps deſirous alſo, that ſome ſtop might be put to the boundleſs progreſſes of the King <hi>Guſtavus.</hi> The Emperour demanded of the Catholick Princes ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy aſſiſtance, for that purpoſe ſending into <hi>Italy</hi> the Baron <hi>de Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bata,</hi> and, taking it for a common cauſe of Religion, in which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Pope by his example to exceed all others, ſends to him the Cardinal <hi>Paſman</hi> Ambaſſador extraordinary. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> was very unwilling to be thus preſſed, becauſe ſuch inſtances were not to be disjoined from reproofs and proteſts; wherefore avoiding to admit ſuch an Ambaſſador, he alledged, that a Cardinal, honoured with the Purple and a holy Character, could not be employed in the ſervice of ſecular Princes. <hi>Paſman,</hi> a man of profound learning and moſt diſcreet in all his actions, replying, that the intereſt of Religion obliged every one, and in particular the Eccleſiaſticks, to take care of it, and procure its defence; declares, that if the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or habit hindred him from the exerciſe of that Miniſtry, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and laid down every thing, being ready alſo to ſpeak in his ſhirt, ſo the imminent neceſſities of the Church Catholick might be provided for.</p>
               <p>At laſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> ſeeing that the excluding the inſtances would be more complained of, than the not hearing of them, admitted him, and heard ſuccours demanded, with a powerful eloquence, as of a <hi>Pope</hi> and of a Father, in the dangers of Religion, and the urgent neceſſities of his Sons. His firſt anſwers were made up of excuſes, that his Treaſury was empty, and that he wanted power, which chiefly aroſe from the <hi>German</hi> Armies having in theſe laſt years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably diſturbed <hi>Italy,</hi> and obliged the Church it ſelf, together with offenſive jealouſies, to exceſſive charges. Whereupon, offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens minds rather than ſatisfying the demands, the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Miniſters reſolved to aſſemble the Cardinals ſubjects, and the friends they had in Court, to compel the <hi>Pope</hi> with ſhame, and preſſing of him yet more home. For which purpoſe Cardinal <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> in the Conſiſtory with others, who had a mind to ſhew incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53750:191"/>
to the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> admoniſhed the <hi>Pope,</hi> and preſented to him a proteſt in writing, laying in a manner to his charge, that he neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in ſo important a neceſſity the duty of his Paſtoral Office. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> to juſtifie himſelf to the Catholick world, publiſhes inſtead of a <hi>Croiſada,</hi> which had been required of him, a <hi>Jubilé,</hi> by which he invites Chriſtendom with publick prayers to pacifie the divine wrath of God, and laying a certain impoſition upon Eccleſiaſtical Goods in <hi>Italy,</hi> raiſes ſome money for the ſupply of the Emperours neceſſities. But of thoſe Cardinals, who had been ſo bold to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the proteſt, he tormented ſome with his long and great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, forced others to retire out of <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Borgia</hi> for one, by a rigorous <hi>Bull</hi> which obliged Biſhops to their reſidence.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Rabata,</hi> he brought nothing back from the Princes but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> in particular ſhewed him the horrid ſpectacle of his wounds yet bleeding. He deſired ſuccours of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and offered an alliance, producing certain Articles, which he affirmed would be aſſented to by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> for the defence of the Catholick Religion in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Empire. It was generally believed, that not ſo much the hopes to obtain ſuccours, as the deſire to make <hi>France</hi> jealous, ſuggeſted the deſign; it being obſerved, that at the ſame time there arrived, in the name of the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator <hi>Picinardi</hi> to atteſt the juſt intention of the Catholick King for Peace, the deſire for that purpoſe to unite himſelf with the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> in a ſtrict alliance, and in particular that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick would contribute counſel, example, and endeavours. He concealed not the jealouſies, that the Governour had for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of nine hundred <hi>French</hi> with <hi>Thoiras</hi> into <hi>Caſal,</hi> and preſaged troubles and ſtirs about it. The Senate anſwered to all with offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous expreſſions of a neutrality, which it had reſolved to obſerve, declaring its earneſt endeavours applied to Peace, and, conſidering the State of <hi>Italy</hi> ſcarce recovered out of its great evils, exhorted, that employing that zeal which all have to quiet, the appearances and jealouſies of relapſing into troubles might be removed. The like endeavours were uſed with <hi>France,</hi> which ſeemed equally preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, offering alliances and Treaties. But the <hi>Senate,</hi> holding their intereſt and Arms ingaged for the ſecurity of <hi>Mantua,</hi> refuſed in effect every thing that might haſten new troubles in <hi>Italy,</hi> which though quiet, yet under fear, apprehended ſtranger and greater acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Nor amongſt the leaſt was reckoned the ſuſpicion, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſigned the ſurpriſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to oppoſe it to <hi>Pignerol</hi> and <hi>Caſal,</hi> where the Duke, overcome by the perſwaſions of the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, and of the jealouſies, which they repreſented to him to be of imminent danger, had (as hath been before ſaid) admitted their Garriſon. It was commonly ſpoken, that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> were to intrude themſelves into <hi>Sabioneda,</hi> by marrying the Princeſs of <hi>Stigliana</hi> to <hi>Giovanni Carolo,</hi> Brother of the Great Duke, and upon the report thereof, the Marqueſs <hi>de Fomar</hi> offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to attempt the ſurpriſe, and to deliver the place to the Prince
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53750:192"/>
of <hi>Buzzolo,</hi> to whom he ſaid it did belong, if <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> would ſend their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> did not believe, that it was fit to promote thoſe miſchiefs, which they feared but too near, if the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the young Princeſs coming to marry, that State ſhould be expoſed to new contingencies, and the rights of the Family be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. For that purpoſe there was ſollicited in <hi>Rome</hi> a diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of marriage betwixt the Duke and his Daughter-in-Law, but the <hi>Pope</hi> denyed it, it ſeeming an unfit thing, <hi>that on the Hearſe of the Son ſhould be made the Nuptial Bed of the Father.</hi> To all this, to augment ſuſpicions, was added the great preparations the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made in <hi>Italy,</hi> particularly in the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> where money was provided, men were raiſed, Ships were making ready, with other proviſions, ſhewing thoughts of War and deſigns of ſome undertaking. But at laſt every thing being imbarqued, ſix thouſand Foot and one thouſand Horſe were ſeen to paſs into <hi>Spain,</hi> to foment the commotions of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orleans,</hi> diſmiſſed out of <hi>Lorrain</hi> by virtue of the Agreement, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs to his Mother at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> giving hopes to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to raiſe in the Kingdom a great party in his favour, to which there was no doubt but the <hi>Foreigners</hi> would join. In <hi>France</hi> there ſtill continued againſt <hi>Richelieu</hi> hatred, and envy, the wonted ſhadow of great favours, and was more and more encreaſed, as provoked from the puniſhment which was inflicted on the Mareſhal of <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liac,</hi> who, generally eſteemed, if not innocent, at leaſt guilty but of very ſmall faults, was beheaded by the ſentence of the Judges, who, it was conceived, looked more at the ſevere mind of the Cardinal, that implacably hated him, than at the offence. The Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morenci,</hi> beſides this, ill ſatisfied that he had not the recompences which he pretended due to his merit, offered <hi>Orleans</hi> the Province of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> whereof he was Governour; and others were not wanting, for many cauſes and various aims, to be ready to encreaſe the Faction. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> promiſed to ſend an Army beyond the <hi>Pyrenean,</hi> to ſecond <hi>Monmorenci,</hi> and give <hi>Orleans</hi> the command of another in the Low Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richelieu</hi> on this ſide eluded the deſigns, both by threatning thoſe Provinces to come upon their backs with the Army, which lay about <hi>Triers,</hi> and by inducing the <hi>Hollanders</hi> by the ſtrength of money to go powerfully into the Field. The King now, whilſt <hi>Pont a Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was with little oppoſition rendred to his Army in <hi>Germany,</hi> takes in <hi>Bar le Duc,</hi> and S. <hi>Michael,</hi> and drawing near to <hi>Nancy,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges <hi>Carlo,</hi> who with many excuſes turned himſelf every way, to make it believed that his Kinſman was come into his houſe without his conſent, to make him be gone, and confirming by a new Treaty the conditions of the firſt, to yield to the Crown in propriety the County of <hi>Clermont,</hi> and to deliver the Towns of <hi>Aſtene</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> for ſome years in Hoſtage. <hi>Orleans,</hi> uncertain what to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, had not above two thouſand Horſe, part of his own Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops; but having caſt himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53750:192"/>
Forces proportionable to the deſign into an ingagement of ſuch weight, to put things as far as they could go, enters in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in hope to give a beginning to a general Revolt in the Kingdom. The Cardinal, exalted by the equal ſucceſſes of Fame and Fortune, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting it by wit and artifice, had ſo diſpoſed of things, that not a man durſt open his Gates to the Duke; whereupon ſtraigthned one Flank by <hi>Schomberg,</hi> and followed in the Reer by the Mareſhal <hi>de la Force,</hi> he was forced to caſt himſelf into <hi>Languedock,</hi> though the agreements with certain Governours of places had not as yet been perfected, and that the arrival of the Ships, expected out of <hi>Italy</hi> with Souldiers, being retarded, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to appear in the field. Nevertheleſs <hi>Orleans</hi> was received by <hi>Monmorancy,</hi> and by many of the Province, which united in a Body acknowledged him Lieutenant General for the King againſt the preſent Government. But the Marqueſs <hi>de Foſſez,</hi> Governour of <hi>Monpellier,</hi> refuſes to deliver that place to him, and ſome were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of <hi>Narbone,</hi> who contrived to bring in the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord afterwards, either ſowed by the Art of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> or riſing from the nature of ſuch Unions, where the chief commands precariouſly, brake the neck of that Party; for many deſiring the command, and in particular <hi>Monmorancy, D'Elbeuf,</hi> and <hi>Puilaurens (Orleans</hi> his Favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite) were ſo diſguſted, that, to content them, there was a neceſſity to divide the Army into ſeveral Bodies.</p>
               <p>The King, aſſigning the command of the Armies for the keeping of the Frontiers to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and to the Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> who being of the Blood Royal willingly embraced, by the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the promotion of their hopes to the Crown, haſtens towards thoſe parts, but the ſtorm quickly vaniſhed; for <hi>la Force</hi> diſperſed ſome men that were getting into a body, and ſeveral de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns which were forming in ſeveral parts, and <hi>Schomberg</hi> near to <hi>Chaſtelnodari,</hi> meeting <hi>Orleans,</hi> joyned with <hi>Monmorancy,</hi> ballancing with the advantage of a narrow paſſage the Forces, which he had leſs, charges him with ſo much boldneſs and ſo good fortune, that at the firſt encounter, there being ſlain the Count <hi>de Moret,</hi> Son, but not legitimate, of <hi>Henry</hi> IV, <hi>de Rieux,</hi> and <hi>de la Feuillade,</hi> the reſt was all diſperſed. <hi>Monmorancy</hi> being hurt, was taken Priſoner, and <hi>Orleans</hi> ſaved himſelf by flight. This blow adding to the defeat diſcredit, the Gentry and the chief Cities yielded who could ſooneſt, the King and Cardinal being come ſo near as to receive the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſome, and withal puniſh the diſobedience of others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orleans</hi> demanded peace and pardon upon conditions, that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exceed the fortune of one conquered: for he pretended the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Monmorancy,</hi> the abolition of all faults for his Followers, the reſtitution of the places of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the return of Queen mother, and for himſelf a place of ſecurity; but he was determinately given to underſtand, <hi>That only by his own reputation and the Kings clemency his fault could be covered; for the crimes of others, he ought not to ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh himſelf with them; the King being reſolved that henceforward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion ſhould not be rewarded, and that his Subjects ſhould not find be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:53750:193"/>
or ſecurity but in duty and obedience.</hi> Reduced therefore to be without followers and without places, he was forced to receive any conditions, <hi>Richelieu</hi> aiming ſo to diſcredit him, that, he abandoning thoſe that had taken part with him, no man hereafter might dare to follow him, or truſt to depend upon him. He was no ſooner reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Champagne</hi> (his Country-houſe) but he heard, that <hi>Monmorancy</hi> with a ſevere but neceſſary example, by Sentence of the Parliament of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> had loſt his head. A death without doubt unworthy thoſe famous actions, with which he had adorned the years, as yet but young, of his life; but which, he having ſo often in fight cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly encountred at the head of ſo many dangers, was with equal undauntedneſs undergone by him, amidſt the unhappineſs of the miſdemeanours and the ignominy of the Sentence. <hi>Orleans</hi> greatly moved, publiſhed, that <hi>Monſieur de Bouillon,</hi> in the Treaty made with him, had ſecretly promiſed his indemnity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore complaining to have been deceived, makes an eſcape once more into <hi>Lorrain.</hi> The Cardinal, after a ſhort indiſpoſition reſtored to health, and having diſcarded the Guarde-ſceau <hi>Chaſteauneuf,</hi> for having had the boldneſs by ſecret Engines to aſpire to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, proves no leſs happy in ſowing civil diſcord betwixt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad, than he had been in rooting them out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Henry Van de Berg</hi> had the Command in <hi>Flanders</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, notwithſtanding the envy, emulation, and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Miniſters, who laid to his charge the holding intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with <hi>Orange,</hi> to whom he was nearly allied, and who, when they paſſed the <hi>Iſſel,</hi> was backward in oppreſſing the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> to extend the Proſperity and Domination of the King. Vexed therefore with many diſguſts, and obſerved with a jealous eye, he at laſt endures it no longer, retiring on a ſudden into <hi>Holland,</hi> and thence paſſing to <hi>Liege,</hi> from thence inviting the people to ſhake off the yoke, and redeem their liberty, in imitation of the <hi>Helvetians</hi> by driving away the Strangers. Having with ſecret incouragement from <hi>France</hi> got together ſome Troops, he removes to <hi>Aken,</hi> in hope to form a third party; but ſeeing no body come to him, was forced, not without ſome diſcredit, to put himſelf under the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>States.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> hereupon appeared to be much diſtracted, and full of cares, fearing leſt the Nobility ſhould be of the ſame mind, and the diſpoſition of the people wavering; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, to entertain them with an appearing ſatisfaction, they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> the States of the Provinces; a thing, which as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious and of danger, had been diſuſed for a very long time. Nor did it now prove of advantage, becauſe ſome, admitted to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of delivering their opinions, and to make demands, thought to moderate at leaſt, if not ſhake off, the Dominion of <hi>Spain,</hi> and they ſent Deputies to the <hi>Hague</hi> to treat of an Agreement; but the States inſiſted, that before entring into the buſineſs they ſhould drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the Country, which not being in their power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppreſſed with Armies, and bridled by Citadels, ſerved never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53750:193"/>
to diſunite them, and make the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo jealous, that not being willing to uſe the people longer to ſuch diſcourſes, Command came from <hi>Madrid,</hi> that the Aſſembly ſhould be diſſolved. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many, knowing that they were rendred ſuſpect for having truly declared their Judgments, left the Country with better ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs than thoſe, who truſting too far, were, though after ſome years, ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> taking advantage of theſe diſcords, invited by the <hi>Swedes</hi> by a ſolemn Ambaſſage, and induced by <hi>France</hi> with a conſiderable ſum of money, after having taken <hi>Venlo</hi> and <hi>Ruremond,</hi> attacqued <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> a place of great ſtrength. The Marqueſs of <hi>Santa Croce,</hi> General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, knowing himſelf not able alone to relieve it, with Preſents and Intreaties invites <hi>Papen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haim,</hi> who thereupon abandoning the Elector of <hi>Colen,</hi> who ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> comes with the Imperial Troops to joyn with him, and with incredible boldneſs attacques the <hi>Hollaners</hi> Camp. But <hi>Santa Croce</hi> remaining an immoveable Spectator of the ſucceſs, the <hi>Germans</hi> found the Lines ſo ſtrong and well raiſed, and provided with ſo many Cannon, that with much loſs they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retire. The place then, after a Siege of almoſt three months finding it ſelf, having loſt all the Out-works ſtraightned by the approaches, with open Breaches, and the Ramparts blown up with Mines, capitulates with honourable conditions the Surrender; the Garriſon, reduced to fifteen hundred men, marching out in ſight of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Armies. Upon this conqueſt, being an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great reputation, they got the Towns of <hi>Orſoy</hi> and <hi>Limburg</hi> with other places thereabouts, which extended the contributions very far. Nor had at this time the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Army given a little Jealouſie on the ſide of <hi>France,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found themſelves obliged to oppoſe to him a body not inferiour under <hi>Carlo Colonna.</hi> Thus the Crowns, being not yet broken out into War, exerciſed openly the hatred of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who imployed their wits with equal cunning, but different fortune; for as to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> the felicity of ſucceſs did frequently out-run his deſires and go beyond his deſigns, whereas on the other ſide the <hi>Conde Duke</hi> could not conceive a thought, but it was enough to render the effect abortive and unhappy.</p>
               <p>But the death of King <hi>Guſtavus</hi> looked as if it might make a change in affairs every where. He with the progreſs he made in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> had deſigned to fall into <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in hope, that in that, which is called the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper,</hi> the Peaſants ill affected to the preſent State, would have riſen, and the minds as well as the forces would have been raiſed of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who concealing themſelves, or making an open profeſſion together, made no ſmall Party in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He therefore had firſt made a courſe into <hi>Suevia,</hi> and all ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at his appearance, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm, Meminghen,</hi> and other places fell eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into his power. In the mean time <hi>Walleſtain</hi> in <hi>Moravia</hi> quietly compleats his Army, and left <hi>Gallas</hi> with a ſmall body in <hi>Bohemia</hi> to attend upon <hi>Saxony.</hi> But underſtanding that ſome of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:53750:194"/>
aſſembled in <hi>Torgan,</hi> had reſolved to join with that <hi>Elector,</hi> he moves with his whole Army, and coming to <hi>Prague</hi> recovers the City without much diſpute. From thence he had a mind to give <hi>Saxony</hi> a Blow, numbring the loſſes of <hi>Bavaria</hi> amongſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments. Nevertheleſs, called back by the clamours of the Duke <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and his entreaties, rather than the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he leaves <hi>Gallas</hi> with a new re-inforcement to oppoſe <hi>Arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim,</hi> General of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and with a ſlow march takes his way towards <hi>Bavaria,</hi> leaving in his paſſage through the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> ſo many marks of military licenſe, and his own hatred againſt the Duke, that it looked as if he went rather to ruine him, than carry him relief. Afterwards, near <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> a City, as is known, amongſt the free ones to be one of the greateſt, but alſo the moſt tenacious amongſt thoſe of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> he intrenches himſelf. The King could not ſuffer the ruine of it, without looſing that cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit which he had with that party; whereupon he made haſte to draw near to it, and encamping about it, was in place of a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the City, which ſupplied neceſſaries and conveniencies to the Army. This our Age, and perhaps ſcarce any paſt, had not ſeen aſſembled together ſo powerful Forces, reckoned in both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies about eighty thouſand Souldiers, beſides followers and uſeleſs people, which amounted to an incredible ſum. Victuals neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs were plenty, and diſcipline flouriſhed by the vigilance and skill of the Chiefs, who had art and valour not unſutable to their ſtrength. Each pretended to overcome his Enemy, either by tempting him with inconveniencies, or provoking him with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Walleſtein</hi> placed his hopes more in prolonging the War, than precipitating his Councils, and the King, placing all in reputation and fortune, deſired to come to an engagement. After having offered Battel to no purpoſe, he aſſaults the Enemies quarters, and at the firſt fury the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> who were quartered thereabout, giving way, he hoped to have maſtered the Trenches; and in effect broke into them, but finding greater reſiſtance from the high and difficult ſituation, it gave time to <hi>Fridtland</hi> to come to the relief, and to repulſe him. Three thouſand of the <hi>Swedes</hi> were killed upon the place, and it being the firſt encounter, wherein whether it was fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or fortune that deceived <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> it is not to be ſaid how af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted he was at it, and how much that title of <hi>Invincible,</hi> which common opinion had attributed to him, remained prejudiced. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by a generous impatience for ſo long and unſucceſsful ſtay, leaving in the City a numerous Garriſon, he marching towards <hi>Francony,</hi> ſending <hi>Banier</hi> into <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to keep the Duke from the Imperialiſts, and diſpute with him the re-conqueſts of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, becauſe, whilſt the Armies had been employed about <hi>Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> the Elector <hi>Maximilian</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the people had recovered moſt of what he had loſt, and making advantage of others dangers had brought a Garriſon into the Imperial City of <hi>Ratisbone. Walleſtein</hi> follows the Kings Army, who directing his
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53750:194"/>
march towards <hi>Wittemberg,</hi> thought by drawing the Imperialiſts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, to conſume and weary them, to overcome them afterwards more eaſily, when he ſhould meet with a fit place, and an occaſion ſeaſonable to give Battel. But <hi>Walleſtein</hi> conſidering, that for the approaching Winter he loſt theſe better quarters, the further he went from thoſe convenient Provinces, ceaſing to follow, goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Miſnia,</hi> taking <hi>Leipzick</hi> and every other place of any moment. He had a mind in <hi>Saxony</hi> to attacque <hi>Dreſden,</hi> the reſidence of the Elector, not ſo much to divert him from making progreſs in <hi>Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> as to chaſtiſe him by taking quarters in his Country. Thence in the Spring he deſigned to go into Mechelburg, to recover that Province, cauſing <hi>Papenhaim</hi> to be his forerunner, who in the mean time in the <hi>Lower Saxony</hi> attempted important Conqueſts. The King perſwaded by the prayers and dangers of the Elector, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his proteſts, that if he abandoned him he would incline to Peace, joining <hi>Bannier</hi> ſets forwards to his ſuccours; whereupon <hi>Fridtland</hi> recalling <hi>Papenhaim,</hi> thought to poſſeſs <hi>Naumburg</hi> to ſtop his way; but prevented by the King, reſolves to protract time, and ſends back <hi>Papenhaim</hi> to relieve <hi>Colen,</hi> by another body of the <hi>Swedes</hi> beſieged. Nor was the King much inclined to a Battel; but ſeeing the Imperialiſts weakened, follows them to <hi>Lutzen,</hi> a ſmall Town not far from <hi>Leipzick.</hi> There <hi>Fridtlandt</hi> doubting to be conſtrained, with great diſadvantage, to ſome encounter, recals in all haſte <hi>Papenhaim,</hi> who willingly keeping himſelf in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand apart, was ingaged in the Siege of <hi>Hall.</hi> But the King haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Battel ſo much, that <hi>Papenhaim</hi> hardly arrived in time with thoſe of his Troops which were in the greateſt readineſs.</p>
               <p>The ſixteenth of <hi>November</hi> was the day, on which with the blood of ſixty thouſand Souldiers, that in both Armies boldly expoſed their lives, it ſeemed that the fortune and glory both of the King and of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> was to be decided. The Troops were the day before marſhalled into their diſtinct orders; the Imperialiſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of great Battalions of Foot, with the Horſe that defended the flanks; the <hi>Swedes</hi> in two very long Lines, mingled with Foot and Horſe. Each had great ſtore of Cannon in the front, nor could there on either ſide be ſeen better order, or greater daring: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Fight was deferred, the King ſeeming irreſolute and troubled; but expreſſed himſelf, that for reputation it was fit to fight, doubting nevertheleſs that Heaven would puniſh him, by letting many, that worſhipped him as a God, ſee that he was indeed but <hi>Man.</hi> Each kept their order all the night, and <hi>Walleſtein</hi> took a great advantage by lining with Muſquetiers certain ditches juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Enemy. So that about theſe, at the firſt peep of day, was he hotteſt of the Fight, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> proſpered in the gaining of them, though hindred by a thick miſt diſcerned not in the Fight either their danger or advantages. Six Cannons being taken, they turned them againſt the Imperialiſts, doing great ſlaughter with them. They nevertheleſs getting into order again, repulſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ditches the Enemy, who left four of the Cannon nailed
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:53750:195"/>
and carried away two. The left Wing of the Imperialiſts, where was the <hi>Poliſh</hi> and <hi>Croatian</hi> Horſe, uſed more to Incurſions than ſet Battels, being charged by the Kings left, eaſily gave way, and would have diſordered other Squadrons, if <hi>Papenhaim,</hi> bringing them again to fight, had not ſtopped the Enemy, till ſtruk with a Cannon bullet he dyed, with that commendation of valour and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which with the teſtimony of many ſcars appeared imprinted upon his face. The King, that thought it the honour and duty of a great Captain, not to overcome only with the blood of others, but having ordered his Troops, and given directions for the Battel, to hazard himſelf no leſs than a common Souldier, was there killed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, leaving it uncertain, whether in truth he overcame or dyed firſt. Some will have it, that in the beginning of the Battel, paſſing from diviſion to diviſion, accompanied but with few, he fell into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Enemies Horſe, by reaſon of the Miſt not diſcovered, and that while unknown with his Sword in his hand he defended himſelf, and by a ſhot of a Carabine being flung out of the Saddle, and by one foot in the Stirrup, by the Horſe dragged away, he was afterwards by another ſhot ſlain. Others, that having in the left Wing beaten the Imperialiſts, and now certain of the Victory, he was ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting elſewhere; but by a Company of Horſe, which advanced to charge, was flung to the ground, and as an ordinary man trampled upon, and amongſt others ſtript. There wanted not ſome who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, (and this is the moſt rational account of them who were in the Battel,) that the King, whilſt at the head of the Regiment of Colonel <hi>Verde</hi> of <hi>Finlanders,</hi> ſeconded by two others of <hi>Swedes,</hi> charged a great Body of eight hundred Cuiraſſiers, commanded by <hi>Ottavio Piccolomini,</hi> was ſhot with a Piſtol in the Arm: for his Cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſe, by reaſon of ſome old hurts, incommoding him, he wore no Arms in the Battel; but not to diſcourage the Souldiers, conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hurt, and though willing to redouble the charge, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by pain, had reſolved to retire with a few, when at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he was with a Carabine ſhot in the Back by a Souldier, who was killed in the ſame occaſion. <hi>Piccolomini</hi> returning then to the charge, paſſed over him yet alive, and left him under a heap of dead bodies ignobly covered. It was never known, who could boaſt of ſuch a blow, either becauſe in Battels chance bears ſo great a ſway, that confounding the Fate of the King with that of the Souldiers, they are not diſtinguiſhed after death but by Glory or Oblivion, or becauſe in this Fortune had withal a mind to ſhew her ſelf favourable, that no mean perſon may vaunt himſelf to have killed ſo great a King, and withal ſo noble a Souldier. The <hi>Swedes</hi> continuing the fight, ended the Victory before they knew of his death. So that the Souldiers accuſtomed to fight under the eye of him from whom they expected reward and commendation, believing he was fighting with them, and would overcome, diſordered not their Ranks, nor grew cool in their accuſtomed courage. <hi>Bernard</hi> Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> alone knowing the Kings Horſe, that ran looſe and was bloody, being aware of what was happened, but inraged with the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53750:195"/>
grief, not to give time to the Souldiers to take notice of it, charged with ſuch a force, that the Imperial Army was conſtrained to give way. The Horſe of both Wings were now fled, <hi>Piccolomini</hi> alone remained the laſt with his Regiment, and with proofs of wonderful valour, after four Horſes killed under him, had five wounds upon him, which <hi>Walleſtain</hi> with a generous Preſent of twenty thouſand Crowns cured and acknowledged. And the <hi>Swedes</hi> would now have environed the Enemies Foot on all ſides, when the Miſt, which aroſe towards the evening, hindred them, and the darkneſs of the night after ten hours ſeparated this cruel fight. Ten with the title of Generals were killed in both the Armies. <hi>Walleſtain</hi> was rather threatned than hurt with the ſhot of a Muſket, which favourably paſſed betwixt the ſeat and the buttock, though at the blow, not without a mark of exceſſive fear, he let the bridle fall out of his hand, and his Horſe ran away with him. The Imperialiſts by night retired towards <hi>Leipzich,</hi> leaving their Cannon in the field; becauſe in the confuſion of the Battel the Draught-horſes were run away. But in the Triumph of the <hi>Swedes</hi> the General was wanting; which filling the Army, that infinitely loved him, with ſorrow and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſome deplored the flower of his age, others the vigour of his mind, and all together the quality of a great Prince and no leſs Souldier. He was found amongſt the dead bodies mangled with wounds, bruiſed with the trampling of Horſes, ſtript totally, that not ſo much as his ſhirt remained as a Trophy of ſo many Conqueſts and ſo great an Empire. A King certainly, ſaving the errour of his Religion, endowed with thoſe qualities which have rendred the Conquerours of the World famous. Poſſeſſing in an equal degree courage and prudence, and if in conquering he ſeemed fierce and violent, he was as wiſe and circumſpect in preſerving. His vertues being ſolid and all of a piece, it could not be diſcerned, to which in his knowledge of the Military or Civil Affairs the prize was to be given. Yet all his life having been in a continual exerciſe of Arms, it ſeemed, that he himſelf gave it the preference. And indeed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in theſe ſo far favoured him, that having fought many Battels, and always conquered, in this very inſtant of death he dyed victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious after death, and a long courſe of proſperity hath crowned in ſuch ſort his Sepulchre, that his very aſhes may be called <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant.</hi>

               <p>By the death of <hi>Guſtavus</hi> all the World believed, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poſthumous Victory and the advantages of Arms, that as great and weighty bodies, when they fall, are ſplit into ſmall pieces, ſo Fortune would be ſhaken and ſuch a breach made into that Power, that the Armies ſhould diſband, Princes diſunite, Conqueſts be loſt, and after a ſhort flaſh there would remain of this great Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroke no more but the memory and the aſhes. But quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for after having ſetled in <hi>Swede</hi> the Succeſſion of the Crown in <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> the only Daughter of the King deceaſed, and placed the Tutelage of her that was not above ſeven years old, in the hands of the principal Miniſters, the Chiefs of the Army, calling a Council in <hi>Germany,</hi> reſolved to continue the War ſo much the more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by how much they hoped, that Honour and Booty will in future accrue to their advantage. To <hi>Axel Oxenſtern,</hi> great Chancellor, a man of a notable Talent, they yielded the direction of the ordinary Counſels, and to <hi>Weimar</hi> they committed the chief management of the Armies, not without diſtaſting the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who by reaſon of his dignity thought it due to him. So the War under divers Chiefs and with ſeveral Armies, was preſently ſpread into many Provinces, to the ſo much ruine of places and people, that if
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53750:196"/>
it ordinarily be nouriſhed with cruelty and blood; at preſent it ſeemed that the alone deſolating of <hi>Germany</hi> was the aim of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Amongſt infinite ſucceſſes, which changing felicity and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hapned in ſeveral places, it ſhall ſuffice to make choice of the moſt ſignal, that ſerve moſt for the reflection of Princes and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of States. Whilſt the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Chiefs were dividing deſigns and charges, <hi>Fridtland</hi> not only goes far from <hi>Leipzich,</hi> but out of the Countries of the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> though with the fright of his Arms he might eaſily have perſwaded him to an agreement; and leaving but a few Troops in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> goes into <hi>Sileſia</hi> under pretext to oppoſe the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who indeed made leſs diſturbance there than elſewhere.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> joyful for the death of the King <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> ſtorm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nevertheleſs againſt their own General, accuſing him, that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſo great a conjuncture to end the War with advantage, he had not made uſe of the arts proper to a Conquerour, nor his wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones of a great Captain. Wherefore the confidence, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had in him, did henceforward degenerate into ſuſpicion, that he was pleaſed with War and the Command; whereupon to ſatiate his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or rather to found his intention, a great ſum of money in the name of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was offered him, that by his reputation and conduct an Army being raiſed, he would ſend it againſt the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> for the Conqueſt of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> of which with the title of King they willingly gave him the propriety. He by reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the offer increaſed the jealouſie, and much more by entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a project of agreement with <hi>Arnheim,</hi> General of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> juſtly offenſive to the Emperour, though <hi>Fridland</hi> with wonted craft let him know that he had no other end but to delude and amuſe the Enemy. But <hi>Arnheim</hi> having taken his march towards <hi>Leutmerits,</hi> to attacque <hi>Gallas,</hi> he makes a ſhow to follow him, but on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den falls near <hi>Stenan</hi> upon a body of men commanded by the old Count <hi>de la Tour</hi> and the Collonel <hi>Tubald,</hi> and ſurpriſes them in ſuch ſort, that wanting means and time to defend themſelves, the Souldiers rendred themſelves upon the ſhameful conditions to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the Cannon and Colours, to inroll themſelves amongſt the Imperial Troops, and to leave their Commanders Priſoners until the other places of <hi>Sileſia</hi> ſhould be rendred to <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> But the Governours refuſing to obey the orders of <hi>Tubald</hi> and <hi>la Tour, Fridland</hi> nevertheleſs increaſing as it were with his military attempts, the ſuſpicions, which were had of his intentions, gave to the one together with many Officers liberty, and promoted the eſcape of the other. He afterwards recovers <hi>Lignits, Glogau,</hi> and <hi>Francford</hi> on the <hi>Oder,</hi> and would have paſſed on further, aſpiring to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Mechelburg,</hi> without conſidering thoſe greater miſchiefs which the Emperour ſuffered elſewhere, if new and greater acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents had not recalled him.</p>
               <p>After the death of the King <hi>Guſtavus, France</hi> ſaw the Affairs of the Empire conſtituted in a ſtate which was more pleaſing to them, the proſperity of thoſe Arms declining, which at firſt gave them
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53750:197"/>
great jealouſie, and all the party of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> reduced to a neceſſity to receive with its aſſiſtances the law and motion of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. Therefore renewing in <hi>Hailbrun</hi> for other ten years, with the Chiefs of the <hi>Swedes</hi> Army, the Treaty, which <hi>France</hi> had with the King deceaſed, and inlarging it with other Princes of that faction, it obliges them to hold him for a common Enemy that ſhould dare to ſeparate himſelf, or conclude a Peace without the conſent of all. Supplying then the Confederates with money, the King of <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins alſo to diſpoſe of thoſe Forces. Whereupon to divert the United Provinces from the wonted Treaties about a Truce with <hi>Spain,</hi> he brings to paſs, that the Colonel <hi>Melander,</hi> who ſerved the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> ſhould be ſent with a good number of Troops to join <hi>Orange,</hi> who ſo re-inforced might take <hi>Rhinberg,</hi> and keep the Armies of <hi>Spain</hi> ſo diſtracted, that the <hi>French</hi> under the title of protection might have ſucceſs in making themſelves Maſters of all the Country of <hi>Trier</hi> without reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> then the Duke <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Luneburg,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe</hi> in their progreſs againſt the Elector of <hi>Colen,</hi> and other Catholicks of that quarter, defeated the Count <hi>John Merode,</hi> who with an Army of thirteen thouſand men, raiſed with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> money, defended that circle, and intended to attempt the relief of <hi>Hamelen;</hi> but being put to flight by the Proteſtants, left them in prey not only almoſt all his Souldiers, with Cannon and Baggage, but the place it ſelf, and many others thereabouts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weimar</hi> in this interim employs himſelf in <hi>Francony,</hi> and <hi>Horn</hi> with <hi>Bannier</hi> oppoſed themſelves to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who with his own Forces alone upholding in thoſe parts the Affairs of the Catholicks was after the taking of <hi>Raim</hi> paſſed into <hi>Swevia,</hi> and there taken <hi>Meminghen</hi> and <hi>Kempen.</hi> The <hi>Swedes</hi> effectually ſtrengthened at <hi>Donawert</hi> to the number of ſeven thouſand Horſe and eight and twenty thouſand Foot, did moſt terrible miſchiefs in his Country, poſſeſſing themſelves of <hi>Munichen,</hi> and the Biſhoprick of <hi>Aichſtadt;</hi> but by <hi>Aldringher,</hi> who came ſpeedily to his aſſiſtance, were conſtrained to retire out of it. The <hi>Auſtrians</hi> were not a whit leſs troubled by the <hi>Rhingrafe</hi> in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and for the defence of it, had ſtirred up with great promiſes <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who equally ready to take Arms and to lay them down, had, in order to the executing of the Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> delivered to the King ſome Troops, but in ſuch ſort that they immediately disbanding, and re-aſſembled anew under the name of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> with others, which he feigned to licenſe, forming an indifferent Army, they took in <hi>Haghenau, Colmar,</hi> and other places, which being preſently put into his hand ſerved for the price of his ingagement, and a ſpur to his declaration in favour of the Emperour. He hoped to quell the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Force by Arms, and to preſerve himſelf from the invaſion of the <hi>French,</hi> by the revolutions which <hi>Orleans</hi> promiſed to raiſe up in that Kingdom. But on the one ſide his deſign was betrayed by fortune, and on the other ſucceſs anſwered not his hopes; for in the firſt place the <hi>Swedes</hi> being come to recover <hi>Haguenau,</hi>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:53750:197"/>
whilſt <hi>Charles</hi> attempted to relieve it, he was entirely defeated by them; whereupon <hi>Lorrain,</hi> no leſs than <hi>alſatia,</hi> remaining a prey to the Enemy, the <hi>Rhingrave</hi> with many incurſions did miſerably afflict him. <hi>Lewis</hi> then taking upon himſelf the revenge of the common injury, poſſeſſes without diſpute the Dukedom of <hi>Bar,</hi> after an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Parliament, which declared it devolved to the Crown; for that <hi>Charles</hi> had not done his Homage for it, and St. <hi>Michael, Pont a Mouſſon, Chaunes, Luneville,</hi> and other places of leſs importance being rendred, he comes near with his Army to <hi>Nancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> having brought the War into his own Country, without means to maintain it, endeavours to pacifie the King with ſeveral propoſitions of ſubmiſſion and agreement. But <hi>Richelieu</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not for caution of his faith other pledge, than the depoſiting of <hi>Nancy</hi> the Metropolis of the Country, the reſidence of the Duke, and a very ſtrong place. The Duke ſeeing that by nouriſhing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſts he had put all things into a confuſion, renounces on a ſudden to the Cardinal <hi>Nicola Franciſco,</hi> his Brother, with the Title, the Country, to the end that being new as to offences, he might better mitigate the reſentments. <hi>Richelieu,</hi> deſpiſing the ſhift, and calling the contrivance fraudulent, refuſes any propoſitions from the new Duke, though having laid down his Purple ſought in marriage <hi>Mad. Combalet,</hi> the Cardinals beloved Neece; offered inſtead of <hi>Nancy</hi> to depoſit <hi>la Motha,</hi> and to cauſe to paſs into <hi>France Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> whoſe marriage with <hi>Orleans</hi> King <hi>Lewis</hi> pretended was null, as contrary to the Laws of the Kingdom, which prohibit thoſe in ſucceſſion to the Crown to marry without the Kings conſent. But theſe very propoſitions were by <hi>Richelieu</hi> turned into diſtruſts and accuſations; for that <hi>Margaret,</hi> while theſe things were in agitation, going out of <hi>Nancy</hi> diſguiſed, and deceiving the <hi>French</hi> Guards, which environed the place on all ſides, made her eſcape by flight, and came to her Husband at <hi>Bruſſels;</hi> after having wandred in the woods, and narrowly avoided the riſque of falling into the hands of ſome <hi>Swediſh</hi> parties of Souldiers; whence <hi>Richelieu</hi> aſcribing all to the fallacious faith of the <hi>Lorraineſe,</hi> and ſcorning the alliance offered, conſtrains him at laſt to promiſe; <hi>To ſeparate himſelf from ſtranger friendſhips, and not to meddle in the Affairs of</hi> Germany, <hi>to join cloſe with</hi> France, <hi>and deliver</hi> Nancy <hi>in Hoſtage till time and their actions ſhould mitigate jealouſies, and that the marriage with</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans <hi>were broken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the place aforeſaid conſiſted the ſecurity of the conditions no leſs than the fortune of the Duke. Therefore the Governour by ſecret Orders, which he had from them, denys the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon entry, and on the other ſide the King threatens all ſorts of rigour and force; ſo that within a few days the ſame Treaty was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with the addition only, that both the Dukes had liberty to keep their Reſidence in <hi>Nancy;</hi> a condition which tended recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to deceipt, for by keeping a foot there, the <hi>Lorraineſe</hi> hoped to maintain themſelves the ſtrongeſt, and the <hi>French</hi> propoſed to keep them little leſs than Priſoners. As force is always accuſtomed
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53750:198"/>
to get the better of wit, ſo Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> finding no longer prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in his own Country, nor from Strangers expecting ſuccours, was forced to ſubmit; for being come to the <hi>French</hi> Camp, under a ſhew of confidence, as that which was the laſt remedy, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf to the <hi>King,</hi> he perceived that under the appearance of honour he was under the cuſtody of Guards, and was thereupon obliged to give preciſe orders to the Governour of <hi>Nancy,</hi> that he ſhould receive Monſieur <hi>de Braſac</hi> with a <hi>French</hi> Garriſon; ſo that having by this means obtained his liberty, he thought good to leave <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the King leaving there the Mareſhal <hi>de la Tour</hi> with a great Army, to favour the Siege of <hi>Briſach,</hi> undertaken by the <hi>Rhingrave,</hi> extends as far as the <hi>Rhine</hi> his quarters and advantages, having obtained of one of the Dukes of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> to put a great Garriſon into the Town of <hi>Monpeliard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this vexed the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> and particularly the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if the <hi>French</hi> ſhould remain in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and <hi>Briſach</hi> were loſt, they ſaw the paſſage hindred of ſuccours for <hi>Flanders,</hi> which they were wont to draw out of <hi>Italy</hi> by that way. They reſolved, that <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Infanta,</hi> ſhould paſs to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> to be conveyed from them to his Government of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by a double care, both out of neceſſity to oppoſe to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Fridtland</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> another Chief of conſideration and power, and to provide for the Affairs of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> which by the death of the <hi>Infanta Iſabella</hi> fallen under the direction of the Marqueſs <hi>d' Aitona</hi> were tottering, both from the unquiet humours of the people, who were ill ſatisfied, and the vaſt deſigns of neighbouring Potentates. The Cardinals Voyage could not be performed without great preparations, which conſumed time and money, nor without ſome apprehenſions of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who ſaw the Provinces filled with Souldiers and Proviſions, and the minds of the Miniſters big with bitter diſguſts and troubled thoughts; the <hi>Condé Duke</hi> venting frequent aggravating expreſſions, that Peace could never be enjoyed, if <hi>Italy</hi> were not reſtored to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Conſtitution. And to ſay truth, there appeared no more that face of Authority and Rule, which the Miniſters of that Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy were wont to enjoy, becauſe beſides the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> the one by the Bridle of <hi>Pignarol,</hi> and the other by the cuſtody of <hi>Caſal</hi> and of the <hi>Monferrat,</hi> being made dependants on the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> almoſt all were wavering, and ſome for their profit made merchandiſe of their inclinations, put at preſent in bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance betwixt the one and others Crown.</p>
               <p>Nay the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, though he refuſed the Duke of <hi>Crequi,</hi> ſent by King <hi>Lewis</hi> in the uſual Ambaſſy of obedience, to enter into that League which he propoſed to him, yet he gave manifeſt ſigns of the ancient partiality towards that Crown; ſo that the Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> his Nephew, had thereupon and with large penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons accepted the protection of that Kingdom; and although <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> oppoſed it with the loudeſt appearances, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> nevertheleſs believing rather a ſecret conſent, feared from it pernicious deſigns.
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53750:198"/>
They therefore diſpatched to <hi>Rome</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Cordoua</hi> and <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni Chiaumazzero</hi> in quality of Commiſſoners, to require reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome abuſes of the <hi>Dateria,</hi> which tended to the oppreſſion of the Kingdom of <hi>Spain;</hi> but in effect, to oppoſe themſelves to the Negotiations of <hi>France,</hi> and if they could effect nothing elſe, to avenge the diſguſts with diſguſts: whence it was thought fit, that they ſhould have ſecret inſtructions to demand a Council, and ſtraighten the Pope with threatnings and offenſive demands. Sure it is, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> denying to receive them with the Title of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, which it ſeems ſignifies a certain Juriſdiction and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, wearied with difficulties and delays in ſuch ſort the buſineſs, and cooled alſo the Biſhop with the hopes of a greater Dignity, that the King being aware of it, recalled him, and conferred upon the other the Title of Ambaſſadour, whilſt with time the heat of Spirits being mitigated, and by the contrariety of ſucceſſes the <hi>Spaniards</hi> bowing themſelves more and more to ſufferance, the buſineſs vaniſhed of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Miniſters ceaſed not to imprint in the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> jealous thoughts, and to exhort them to joyn together to drive, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of their Crown, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Italy.</hi> They on the other ſide propoſed to all great advantages, offering by means of the Regent <hi>Villani</hi> to the <hi>Grand Duke</hi> great Penſions, and to the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> to deliver him <hi>Corregio,</hi> a little Soveraign State, which, being by the Emperour confiſcate from its ancient Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the imputation of falſe Money, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had in Pawn, to the end to make Merchandiſe of it with the bordering Princes. To <hi>Parma</hi> they offered the Generalſhip of the Sea and a Vice-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, provided he would, in exchange and as a pledge of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, permit a Levy of ſix thouſand Foot to be ſerviceable to the Cardinal <hi>Infante</hi> in his Voyage into <hi>Flanders.</hi> That Dukedom was poſſeſſed by <hi>Edwardo Farneſe,</hi> young in years, and of a ſpirit more elevated perhaps than the narrowneſs of his Country and Fortune could bear. He by a certain lively Genius inclined naturally to the <hi>French,</hi> and they incouraging it with frequent ſending of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, brought him at laſt to their Party. Taking Jealouſie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the preparatives for the Cardinal <hi>Infante,</hi> and at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>Stigliana</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Medina las Torres</hi> Vice-King of <hi>Naples,</hi> as though he would call in queſtion again <hi>Sabioneda,</hi> armed, and under that pretext receives under his own Colours Souldiers which were ſent to him out of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> above all were more earneſtly preſſed, ſo that <hi>Razzillier,</hi> after having viſited in the Name of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the other Princes, came to incourage them not only to continue in the cuſtody of <hi>Mantua,</hi> but to exhort them to pay at leaſt half the Garriſon in <hi>Sabioneda,</hi> and to take part in the Affairs of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and in the Deſigns concerning the <hi>Valteline.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Republick</hi> conſtant in the deſire, that together with Peace the preſent State of <hi>Italy</hi> might be preſerved, condeſcended no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but better to provide <hi>Mantua</hi> with Souldiers and Cannon, quickning diligence in proportion to the unquietneſs and ſuſpicions
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53750:199"/>
which increaſed in the Dukes Family; becauſe it appeared, that the Princeſs, by the perſwaſions of <hi>Margaret</hi> her Mother, had raiſed her mind to the hopes of marrying her ſelf with the Cardinal <hi>Infante,</hi> who was expected in <hi>Italy,</hi> and taking the opportunity, when the Duke was one day for recreation out of the City, ſhe preſents a Writing to the Council, declaring every act and conſent null, to which in the time of her Minority ſhe had adhered for her own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. A Novelty which greatly troubled the Duke; becauſe that Writing being received and ſubſcribed, not without the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Miniſters, he with reaſon feared, leſt the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being divided, and the Rights of the Succeſſion confounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, the State and the Nephew ſhould come to be ſubjected to more bitter calamities. This being known in <hi>France,</hi> and diſcovered that the Council to the Princeſs was come from <hi>Milan,</hi> it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by King <hi>Lewis</hi> with a peremptory Decree, but neceſſary, that the <hi>Infanta</hi> ſhould depart as ſhe did; for retiring to Caſtle <hi>Gualtier</hi> in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> and thence to <hi>Milan,</hi> the Plots with her abſence va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, ſhe afterwards ſails towards <hi>Spain.</hi> At laſt in the month of <hi>May</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Infante</hi> arrives in <hi>Italy,</hi> and having ſpoken with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in <hi>Nizza</hi> he comes to <hi>Milan,</hi> where he received the Embaſſies of Princes for the congratulating of his arrival, and was pleaſed above all with that of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> performed with great ſplendour by <hi>Bertuccio Valiero,</hi> and correſponding with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition to <hi>Venice</hi> of the Count <hi>Carlo Borromei</hi> his Ambaſſadour.</p>
               <p>About this time the Duke <hi>Vittorio Amadeo</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to rank him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf equal in his behaviour to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and not to condeſcend to the Rules lately introduced amongſt the Cardinals, takes the Title of King of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the World little approving, that, he after having given up with <hi>Pignerol</hi> the honour, which the care of keeping the entrance of <hi>Italy</hi> gave him, ſhould deck himſelf with the Title of that Kingdom, which lyes under the barbarous ſlavery of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> and to the great diſpleaſure of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who had law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enjoyed it for many years, and who complaining of it in all Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> declared themſelves diſobliged from any ſort of correſpondence with the <hi>Savoyards.</hi> The firſt buſineſs, in which the <hi>Cardinal Infante</hi> imployed himſelf, was in deciding the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies betwixt the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which, formerly referred to the Arbitrage of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> were now by him judged on theſe Conditions; <hi>That things taken ſhould be reciprocally reſtored; that</hi> Zuccarello <hi>ſhould remain to the</hi> Genoueſe, <hi>but with pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in four Terms to the Duke one hundred and ſixty thouſand Crowns of Gold; that Estates ſhould be restored to the firſt Owners; that thoſe that had ſerved the one or the other Party ſhould be pardoned, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ten of the Conſpirators, prohibited nevertheleſs that they come not within the Confines of the Republick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The parties concerned not herewith content, power was ſent by the King to the <hi>Cardinal Infante</hi> to determine the difference, and he declares, <hi>That the Galley, by the</hi> Genoueſe <hi>formerly taken, ſhould be reſtored to the</hi> Savoyards, <hi>as it was found at preſent; that the Crown

to be disburſed for</hi> Zuccarello <hi>was underſtood to be of the Coyn of</hi> Spain, <hi>and that beſides ten, to be named by the King, ſhould not be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the pardon any other of the Participants in the Conſpiracy, or that were accuſed of any other offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The affairs of the Empire called him to thoughts of a greater conſequence; for, to the end to ſtop every paſſage, by which he might go into <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Flanders,</hi> beſides the Siege of <hi>Briſach; Horn,</hi> to pleaſe the <hi>French,</hi> taking his paſſage through <hi>Helvetia</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſking the <hi>Cantons</hi> leave, came to about <hi>Conſtance;</hi> whereupon the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army was ſollicited, from the dangers of thoſe places, the clamours of the <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> and much more from the Jealouſies which <hi>Fridtland</hi> gave, by amuſing himſelf in Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces far diſtant, careleſs of the loſſes and damage of <hi>Bavaria, Alſace,</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> which touched the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> to the quick. They then deliberate to form the body of an Army independent from him, the Emperour being at laſt by the urgency of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> brought to conſent to it, after having been in doubt for a good while, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was beſt to let him alone and diſſemble his ſuſpicions, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him by ſhewing diſtruſt; but the <hi>Infante</hi> not able to ſtir with honour or ſafety, it was reſolved, that the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> with ten thouſand Foot and fifteen hundred Horſe ſhould be his fore-runner to open the paſſage, and without longer delay ſuccour thoſe Towns.</p>
               <p>By the way of the <hi>Valteline</hi> and <hi>Bormio</hi> he enters into <hi>Tirol, Rohan</hi> from <hi>Rhetia</hi> not caring to trouble him, being rather glad that the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> ſhould be weakned of Forces, by reaſon of the deſigns which were under conſideration. At the report of this march <hi>Horn</hi> &amp; the <hi>Rhingrave</hi> withdrew their Troops further diſtant from <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Briſach;</hi> ſo that <hi>Feria</hi> joyning without oppoſition with <hi>Aldrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gher,</hi> might have been able to execute what they deſigned, if they had not been diſturbed by the loſs of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> which by <hi>Weymar,</hi> after he had paſſed the <hi>Danube,</hi> and taken <hi>Neoburg</hi> with other places, as may be ſaid, at unawares, was with furious Batteries in a few days taken: a blow, which by reaſon of the ſituation and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the place, applauded by his Party, afflicted in a high meaſure the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> becauſe with it loſing <hi>Straubing</hi> alſo and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendorf,</hi> they were afraid of <hi>Paſſau,</hi> a City tripartite, where the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Eno</hi> and <hi>Iltz</hi> falling into the <hi>Danube,</hi> form as it were a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold part, of <hi>Bavaria, Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Auſtria.</hi> Nor did <hi>Weimar</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the thought of the enterpriſe, but finding it provided, and the Winter advancing, to preſerve his Troops diſtributes them into Quarters about <hi>Ratisbone;</hi> whereupon the deſigns of the Catholicks were in great diſorder: for <hi>Aldringher</hi> was obliged to go back to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and <hi>Feria</hi> was conſtrained to remain there, dividing his Army with great inconvenience into ſcattered Quarters in <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> where many Souldiers periſhed by ſickneſs and other ſufferings, and himſelf left his life alſo.</p>

               <p>Whilſt the Republick complained of it, and the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters interpoſed and got no ſatisfaction, the Governour publiſhes againſt the Conſul a moſt ſevere Proclamation, laying to his charge, that he had unladen, in the ſuſpected time of the plague, Merchandiſe out of a Bark which came from <hi>Venice;</hi> but there appeared in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence more of pretext than of his fault, becauſe he juſtified himſelf to have done it by permiſſion of the Magiſtrates. This increaſed the reſentment of the Republick, and gave occaſion to the <hi>French</hi> to renew with more earneſt their Mediation, by which it was agreed, that recalling the Proclamation, <hi>Oberti</hi> ſhould be admitted, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſhewing themſelves, when that was done, not averſe from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling him, and appointing ſome other for the place.

Neutrality they had fixed in, anſwers to the invitations by exhorting to Peace, which being the greateſt bleſſing from Heaven, ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be promoted than diſturbed by the proſperity, the Crown enjoyed. Not only the <hi>French</hi> but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo uſed with the other Princes ſuch earneſt endeavours, requiring poſitive declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without admitting neutrality, that ſome grew juſtly jealous, that the Crowns ſought no leſs pretexts for a War, than to make parties for it. At which the <hi>Grand Duke</hi> more moved than the reſt, ſends the Archbiſhop of <hi>Piſa</hi> to the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to propoſe a League betwixt the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes of common defence, to ballance the power of Strangers, and oppoſe the exorbitancy of it. But at this time, as always, affections contending with intereſts, many go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning themſelves by ſeparate Councils, and believing an union with Strangers more compatible than with domeſticks, the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition vaniſhed in its beginning, through the difficulty to introduce it. The <hi>Genoueſe</hi> at this time, embittered by reaſon of paſt acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, and more exaſperated at preſent by the deciſion made by the King and the <hi>Infanta</hi> of their contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> gave ear to the inſinuations of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Novailles,</hi> who, in his paſſage to <hi>Rome,</hi> offered them the Forces, and aſſiſtance of the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> ſo that after having for ſo many years been ſerviceable to the ſole advantages of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they would bring themſelves to a fitting neutrality; whereupon that Republick making uſe of the conjuncture, enters into a correſpondence with <hi>France,</hi> and with many Decrees reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the luſtre of its liberty, and vigour of its Government.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> received this novelty not without a ſharp reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but, being more and more intent upon the contingencies of the Empire, diſſemble all, making it their buſineſs only to take away all jealouſies from the <hi>Italians,</hi> both by reaſon of the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s ſtay and the warlike preparations, without notwithſtanding to neglect the advantages which the conjuncture afforded: for they took hold of the occaſion, to perſwade Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> to depart on a ſudden out of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and go to the command of the Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſending for Hoſtages his Wife and Children into <hi>Spain.</hi> Some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Maurice</hi> the Cardinal, who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to the protection of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> had aſſumed that of the Emperour, held an underſtanding with the Duke their Brother, thereby to divide betwixt them, by artifice, the affections and good will of both the parties. But, in truth, the two Princes, from the weak conſtitution of the Duke foreſeeing his death to be near, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered afar of the ſucceſſion of the Country, and thoſe deſigns which afterwards in their time brake forth, and ſeeing their Siſter-in-Law, by the bonds of intereſt and blood tyed to <hi>France,</hi> caſt themſelves betimes into the arms and protection of the <hi>Auſtrians.</hi> Whereat the Duke, being exceedingly moved, ſequeſtred their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and ſuſpends their aſſignments. The <hi>French,</hi> for all that putting no entire confidence in him, ſhorten the Bridle, increaſing in <hi>Pignarol</hi> and <hi>Monferrat</hi> Troops and Garriſons. The <hi>Infanta</hi> at

laſt, after having concluded a League with the Catholick <hi>Cantons</hi> of <hi>Helvetia</hi> for the life of the King and the Prince his Succeſſor, obliging them to aſſiſt in the defence of the <hi>Franche County,</hi> moves, in the Month of <hi>June,</hi> through the <hi>Valtelline</hi> and <hi>Tirol</hi> towards <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> accompanied by the Marqueſs of <hi>Leganes,</hi> with ſix thouſand Foot and fifteen hundred Horſe.</p>
               <p>It hath been formerly ſaid, what were the aims of <hi>Walleſtein</hi> to amuſe himſelf in Provinces remote, whilſt the more important were in danger; but now upon the loſs of <hi>Ratisbone, Auſtria</hi> was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo, and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> highly proteſted, that if he were not ſuccoured, he would agree with the <hi>Swedes</hi> upon any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and would open them the paſſage into the bowels of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours patrimonial Lands. Whereupon <hi>Ferdinand</hi> with moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual orders ſummons him again to come ſpeedily to the aſſiſtance of his neceſſity, and to his commands added importunities and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he would employ his Army againſt thoſe of his Enemies, which were the moſt dangerous and powerful. He with the height of malice, conſidering that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces were come into the Empire, and knowing the aims of that Crown, tending to thruſt him down, moving the Army as if he would anſwer the ſummons, quarters it in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and diſtributing ſeveral Regiments of his friends into <hi>Auſtria,</hi> it looked as if he would keep <hi>Vienna</hi> blocked, and the Emperour himſelf Priſoner. This gave vent to univerſal complaints; becauſe, beſides publick miſchiefs, the principal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were ſenſible of private loſſes, the Souldiers lodging upon their eſtates with all ſorts of liberty and undiſtinguiſhed licenſe. All then ſhewing zeal equal to the urgent neceſſity, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of the common cauſe demonſtrated the common dangers, and calling to mind the conduct of the General, inveighed particularly againſt the Articles by him formerly projected with <hi>Arnheim,</hi> among which it had been diſcovered, that there was diſcourſe of ridding <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of the baniſhment of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and of the force with which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour might be induced to accept ſo deſtructive a Peace in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Nor was it concealed, that <hi>Walleſtain</hi> openly aſpired to the uſurpation of the Crown of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> that there was a conſpiracy againſt the life of the Emperour and his Sons, held correſpondence with the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and had ſet on foot ſecret Treaties with the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> at the time that Monſieur <hi>de Fequieres</hi> treated in the Empire with the Proteſtants. Every one precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating their judgments, and declaring their ſenſe upon the actions of <hi>Walleſtein,</hi> and the puniſhments he deſerved, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained greatly perplexed; becauſe, if the jealouſies of the preſent Affairs oftentimes moved him, he was almoſt at the ſame time pacified with the memory of his paſt ſervices. The ſhame to puniſh a man ſo well deſerving, with the prejudice to ſuffer his inſolency, put him to a ſtand, and above all he conſidered the danger, which (<hi>Walleſtein</hi> perceiving to be ſuſpected) reſulted no leſs from his rage than from his faults. Wherefore inclining to that courſe
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:53750:201"/>
which was moſt gentle, he cauſed cautiouſly to be inſinuated to him the laying down of the Command and of Arms, to give once more place to envy, and ſignalize his obedience. He deſpiſing promiſes, and not regarding threatnings, looked at himſelf in the affection of the Souldiery and the Officers ſecure, having, while he had been General, accuſtomed the Army both to licence and obedience, and to receive from his hand rewards and puniſhments. In the Court it ſelf, nay among the Council, he wanted not friends, kept ſo with profuſe gifts of money and booty, which he extorted with unjuſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine; ſo that truſting in his Forces and his adherents, aſſembling the Chiefs of the Army, he informs them, that he was required to lay down the Generalſhip thereof: <hi>He numbers up the fatigues, the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, the Victories under the direction of his Command; the years and the ſufferings of their making War together; he accuſes the envy of his old Enemies; not ſparing the Emperour himſelf and his Counſellors, as thoſe, who to defraud the Chief of Glory, the Officers of reward, and the Souldiers of pay, ſeek with calumnies pretexts to oppreſs him. He puts them in mind of the care he had always had of his faithful Fellow-Souldiers, the Booties, the Quarters, the Contributions, the Countries, and the Spoils divided and ſubdivided amongst them. He at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of them help and counſel, for that he now weary of cares, and much more of treacheries, would be glad to apply himſelf to quiet, and leave impartial poſterity to be Judge of Merit and Glory betwixt him and his Enemies.</hi> There was no doubt, but that with clamours, more than diſcourſe or reaſons, he was not perſwaded, and in a manner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not to quit. Into the meetings of good Fellows and into the Quarters this diſcourſe was quickly ſpread. All, to ſtrives, extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his praiſes, <hi>That he was a true valuer of labours and of dangers, the Father and Defender of Souldiers; to whom ſhould they have recourſe for the future, and of whom demand acknowledgments of ſervices and pay, if they would ſuffer the appointment of new Chiefs over the Army, to bury in ſilence and aboliſh with oblivion the ſervices they had done?</hi> He was then by an univerſal conſent animated not to abandon the Army; ſome out of pure affection and military tranſport, others more craftily by his deſtruction to promote their own Fortunes. With a Writing then, ſigned by all, they oblige themſelves not to diſagree, and to the defence of their General, till he, recompenſed in the charges he had been at, the Souldiers alſo ſhould be ſatisfied in their pay. After ſuch an extravagance there was no place left for ſufferance.</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>d'Ognate,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> who for a long time was contriving the ruine of <hi>Walleſtain,</hi> demanding on a ſudden Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the <hi>Emperour,</hi> few being by, and thoſe of the moſt truſted Miniſters, lays before them the ſtate of things, the boldneſs of <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtain,</hi> his Intelligences, his Plots, and Deſigns. Commends the moderation with which <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> as an excellent Prince, had been willing to proceed; <hi>That it was indeed fit to diſſemble ſome ſecret faults in great Miniſters, interpret favourably thoſe that were doubtful, and in a manner bear with thoſe that were manifeſt, ſo long as there
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:53750:202"/>
was no breach of fidelity, the Soul of great Imployments and the Baſis of States. That the arrogance, inſolence, cruelty it ſelf, and avarice of</hi> Walleſtain <hi>had been longer ſuffered. The Empire was now betrayed;</hi> Bohemia <hi>uſurped;</hi> Auſtria <hi>invaded;</hi> Vienna <hi>beſieged; the Emperour a Priſoner, and his Sons under a ſhew of Guard and Quarters. What would one expect more? an occaſion, or a neceſſity?</hi> this <hi>cannot be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> that <hi>not to be wiſhed more fit.</hi> Walleſtain <hi>was feared by many, and abhorred by all; with inſolence and pride he had provoked the hatred of potent Enemies, and the envy of his very Friends. The Emperour was quickly to draw forth his Authority and Juſtice before the</hi> Swedes <hi>could lend a hand to the Rebel; that he ſhould find reſpect among the people, obedienee among the Souldiers, and the applauſe and benedictions of all. The wound is in truth painful, but becauſe it hath its centre in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, the more you will ſuppreſs it, the more it will increaſe. That which hitherto hath been done in the Army, may be rather called a Tranſport than a Revolt. The Militia hath by traiterous promiſes been blinded, and by falſe ſuggeſtions deluded. The Chiefs have given their conſent, terrified by the violencies of the General. That with one ſtroke of a Sword the knot might be united, and it was better with the death of one alone to terminate, or rather prevent, a Civil War, than with Jealouſies provoke it. That there was no time to be loſt, in that which cannot be commended till it be done.</hi> This ſaid; the Conſult was ſhort, fear and fury confuſedly ſeconding one another, and <hi>Ognate</hi> with aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations cutting off diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>It was then reſolved to make tryal of the Souldiers fidelity; for <hi>Gallas</hi> and <hi>Piccolomini,</hi> and ſome others of the Commanders had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly offered the Emperour their endeavours, aſſerting, that many for fear alone having conſented to ſign the Writing, and participate of the fault, were ready to revolt as ſoon as they ſhould ſee a head. A Commiſſion then was diſpatched to <hi>Gallas,</hi> by which all thoſe were commanded to obey him, that would ſhew their fidelity to the Emperour, and ſeparate themſelves from <hi>Walleſtain,</hi> now in open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Upon the publiſhing of this reſolution, he perceived how ſlippery is the truſt to Fortune, which turns her head from thoſe, from whom the Prince withdraws his favour. Seldom, to ſay truth, hath that Power been ſeen to ſubſiſt, which having grown up under the ſhadow of Soveraign Authority, goes about to ſeparate it ſelf from it. At the Name of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Regiments fell into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, the Officers and Chiefs withdrew, the ſound in a moment ſeparating themſelves from the infected. Being then left with a few, not thinking himſelf ſecure in <hi>Pilſen,</hi> where he now was, he leaves the Government of it to one of his Confidents, and takes his way towards <hi>Egra,</hi> beleft to be a fit place, as being the door of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by which he might either let into <hi>Bohemia</hi> Stranger Armies, or ſave himſelf into the neighbouring Provinces. He had ſought to <hi>Weimar</hi> to come ſpeedily to his aſſiſtance, offering to deliver him places; but whilſt the Duke in ſo weighty a matter was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the advantages and the hazards, and that, not to hazard all his Forces, he ſent <hi>Birchenfelt</hi> with one part into the <hi>Palatinate</hi> to give
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:53750:202"/>
him countenance, and Duke <hi>Franceſco Albert</hi> of <hi>Saxe</hi> to <hi>Egra</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the deſigns, the Scene was changed, and the occaſion va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walleſtain</hi> did believe, that thoſe that ſtuck to him, bound by the bonds of gratitude and obligation, would run all ſorts of Fortune with him; but there wanted not ſome that followed him for the opportunity to vent, by betraying him, ſecret hatred and deſigned revenge, and for the hope to get from the Emperour great rewards. He had with him the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Regiment of Colonel <hi>Walter Butler, John Gordon</hi> of the ſame Nation, <hi>Terſica</hi> his Kinſman, the Count <hi>Leſly Scotch</hi>-man, Captain of his Guards, <hi>L'Illo,</hi> and other as well Officers as Souldiers, believed to be moſt in confidence with him. Some of theſe began among themſelves to conſider, and then diſcourſe with their Friends, <hi>That in Battels the danger was common to all, but the Reward and Glory was to a few; that an occaſion was here offered to gain a rich Prize with Renown worthily memorable; that the Victory depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their own wills and hands. To what purpoſe follow an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Rebel abhorred of all, that would ſell their Blood, their Honour, together with their Faith, and Towns to Strangers? One ſole blow kills the Sacrifice, expiates the fault, pacifies the Prince; nay obliges him to retribute wealth and favours to thoſe that with their obedience preſerve Kingdoms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was enough to animate them, for every one was already perſwaded of his own Intereſt; whereupon <hi>Leſly, Butler,</hi> and <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> promiſing fidelity to one another, drew in ſome others, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting <hi>L'Illo</hi> and <hi>Terſica</hi> to Supper in their Lodging, growing hot in diſcourſe among their Cups, feigning a Wrangle, confounding Wine with Blood, and violating Hoſpitality, kill them. Thence not to give time to divulge it, haſting to <hi>Walleſtains</hi> Chamber, and forcing the door, whilſt he awakened would have looked out of a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to call for help, and reproached the Conſpirators, they with many blows killed him with a Halbard. Then leaving him dead upon the ground, they went out of the Caſtle to inform the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery with what was done, and flatter them with great promiſes. Nor found they any great trouble to do it; for the Chiefs being dead, not one durſt ſhew reſentment. The day following, keeping the Gates ſhut, that the death might not be publiſhed, they went out of the City, under the pretence of honour and conduct to meet the Duke <hi>Franceſco Albert,</hi> who came in the name of <hi>Weimar</hi> to ſettle ſome agreements, and arreſting him Priſoner, carried him to <hi>Vienna,</hi> where they found great commendations and bountiful rewards.</p>
               <p>Such was the unhappy deſtiny of <hi>Albert</hi> of <hi>Walleſtain,</hi> Duke of <hi>Fridtland,</hi> who had formerly ſubdued the Empire by Arms, and frighted <hi>Europe</hi> with his name. He exalted the Nobleneſs of his Birth by his Military Vertue, which from the loweſt degrees lifted him up to a great Fortune, ſo much the more honourable, as carried to it by his own Merit, he aſcended not upon the ruine of others. Amidſt many faults of ambition, cruelty, and violence, with which he afflicted his very friends, his enemies commended his prudence,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53750:203"/>
his warineſs, and his diſcipline. It ſeemed, that he was always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Fortune and accidents, or rather, that foreſeeing and maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing in his mind, he prevented difficulties and croſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures. He was accuſtomed to overcome, and if at any time he ſeemed to have the worſt, the World, in the belief of his felicity, was perſwaded that he had no mind to overcome. Some condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a certain raſhneſs in his actions that rendred him precipitate; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs being always guided by hidden motives, it was eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, that leaving little to chance, he rewarded not without judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor puniſhed without diſtinction. Whatſoever the cauſe was, if he lived with Glory, he dyed with ſcorn. Nevertheleſs opinions upon his caſe were diverſly conteſted, ſome believing him a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor before adjudged; others, that he caſt himſelf into the Precipice after he ſaw himſelf loſt.</p>
               <p>Whereupon various were the Judgments, the one by the infamy of his preſent actions cancelling the Glory of thoſe paſt, and the others by attributing his diſgrace to the Fortune of great Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, eaſily ſuffering his death, whoſe life they hated before. But in <hi>Vienna,</hi> in regard of his Kindred and Friends, which were in the Court, quickly ſuppreſſing the diſcourſe of the cauſes and of the fact, and puniſhing ſome of the Conſpirators, it was reſolved, that the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> ſhould go into the field, to chear up the Army with his preſence, contain the Souldiers in their duty, and hinder competition amongſt the Chiefs. This could not be done ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> made not great advantage of the paſt altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for that in <hi>Alſace</hi> the <hi>Rhingrave,</hi> routing near <hi>Tarn</hi> the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, took amongſt more conſiderable conqueſts <hi>Enſheim, Friburg,</hi> and <hi>Rinfelden.</hi> In <hi>Swabe</hi> were yielded to <hi>Horn, Meminghem</hi> and <hi>Chempem.</hi> The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> having beſieged <hi>Budweis,</hi> and firſt burnt it with Bombes before he took it, paſſed to <hi>Gorlitz,</hi> which he found abandoned. Retiring then into his own Country, leaves to <hi>Arnheim</hi> the Command of the Army; and he, offering the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts Battel near <hi>Lignitz,</hi> after a long and doubtful fight defeats them with the death of three thouſand of their men, the gaining of many Colours and nine pieces of Cannon, poſſeſſing <hi>Stenau, Glogau,</hi> and other places of importance, at the ſame time that <hi>Banier</hi> took <hi>Francfort</hi> on the <hi>Oder,</hi> and <hi>Croſſen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Hungary</hi> coming forth at laſt with powerful Forces, and the Army incouraged with his preſence, joyns the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> who had recovered <hi>Strubingh,</hi> and begirts <hi>Ratisbone</hi> with a Siege, battering it with a hundred piece of Cannon. <hi>Weimar</hi> draws near to it, diſturbing the Royal Camp, which had not its Circumvalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yet finiſhed; but for want of Victuals he was forced to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance. Nevertheleſs being concerned to preſerve that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, he had a mind, joyning <hi>Horn,</hi> to make another attempt; but withheld by impediments, eſpecially in the Siege of <hi>Lantzhut,</hi> (where <hi>Aldringher</hi> was killed, attempting to put ſuccours into it) when he came near to <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> found it loſt. <hi>Horn</hi> then goes into <hi>Suevia,</hi> and <hi>Weimar</hi> weakned, not being ſtrong enough to face the King, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t <hi>Donawert</hi> and other places fall into his hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:53750:203"/>The King of <hi>Hungary</hi> deſired much to joyn with the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and to prepare the way, advances to attacque <hi>Nortlinghen,</hi> which holding out longer than the Imperialiſts had ſuppoſed, gave time to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Army with the <hi>Infanta</hi> to arrive as a ſeaſonable ſupply, and to the Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> to rejoyn <hi>Horn</hi> to attempt its relief. Theſe two young Princes communicating to one another the deſire of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry no leſs than the Counſels of Arms, would not abandon the Siege; whereupon <hi>Weimar,</hi> not able to endure that it ſhould be loſt in his preſence, reſolves upon a Battel, hoping with the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Arms to recompenſe at once with Victory, that which ſince ſome time the Imperial, under the happy Conduct of the King, had taken from them. He then aſſaults the Enemies Camp with an impreſſion ſo reſolute, that at the firſt brunt he forces the Trenches, poſſeſſes the Cannon, and took a Half-moon, putting the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> every where to flight. But the Officers coming in, nay the King himſelf and the Cardinal calling to the Fugitives, the fright being over, and all the Army taking courage, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops in particular giving mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous proofs of boldneſs, the <hi>Swedes</hi> were repulſed. The Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, levelled from a higher ſituation, made a great ſlaughter among them, becauſe by the ſcite of the field, being to climb over little Hills, they were forced to fight, expoſed to the ſhot, with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of the place, no leſs than with the Enemies. They alſo for not having taken a particular view when they had poſſeſſed the firſt Fortifications, diſordered one another, ſome in going forward miſtaking the way, others in fighting, exceeding the order which had been given them. The worſt accident was, that the fire caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally taking in ſome Barrels of Powder upon the Half-moon, fright was added to diſorder; for the Souldiers, doubting leſt a Mine had been ſprung, ran headlong away, ſo that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the Poſt, but took courage to follow them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weimar</hi> and <hi>Horn</hi> imployed all their diligence to put their Troops again into good order, or at leaſt to retire with leſs diſadvantage, but all in vain; becauſe ſeparated from one another, with Troops every where in diſorder, they neither had communication together, nor did the Souldiers any longer obey their commands. The <hi>Auſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> under the favour of a Wood putting themſelves betwixt them, hindred them of a poſſibility to re-unite. Whereupon the Cavalry being purſued by the <hi>Croats,</hi> turning at laſt their backs, in full Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reer abandoned the Foot, which was almoſt all killed upon the place. The number of the dead was more than ten thouſand, and about ſix thouſand were taken Priſoners. Amongſt theſe was <hi>Horn, Weimar</hi> being ſaved for a better Deſtiny. The <hi>Auſtrians</hi> loſt two thouſand in the firſt heat of the fight, the reſt had no other labour but to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Fugitives, and to kill and ſtrip the conquered. This ſignal Victory was rendred more apparent by the conſequences; for <hi>Heil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun, Wurtzburg, Augsburg,</hi> with many other places, yielded of their own accord, and others were abandoned by the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Garriſons. The Duke of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and the <hi>Landgrave,</hi> that imployed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their own advantages in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> ſhewed inclinations to
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:53750:204"/>
Peace, and <hi>Saxony</hi> hearkened alſo to Propoſitions of Agreement; nor was it doubted, that if the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders had been tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted with money, but they would have abandoned <hi>Germany</hi> and the Fortune of their declining Party. But the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> ſetling their reſt upon hopes, whilſt the <hi>Infanta,</hi> called away by the urgency of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ſeparates from the King, and the King ſatisfied with Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, makes haſte to return to the Court to enjoy the applauſes of it. <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who from the proſperity of the <hi>Swedes</hi> had gotten for the Crown of <hi>France</hi> great advantages, and propoſed to himſelf not a whit the leſs from their diſgrace, ſends the Mareſhal <hi>de la Force</hi> to the <hi>Rhine</hi> with a very puiſſant Army, boaſting aſſiſtance to his Friends, and ſhewing force to his Enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oxeſtern,</hi> who reſiding in <hi>Francfort</hi> had the direction with his Council of that Party, and <hi>Weimar,</hi> that gathered up the reliques of the late misfortune, knew not whither elſe to turn themſelves but to <hi>France,</hi> which in retribution of ſuccours drew out of their hands the ſtrong place of <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> which ſituate on the right banck of the <hi>Rhine</hi> belonged to the Elector of <hi>Trier</hi> as Biſhop of <hi>Spires,</hi> and in the beginning of the year had been poſſeſſed by the <hi>Swedes.</hi> This wounded the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> to the quick, ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> Colours not only advance to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but paſs it alſo, beſides confirming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more and more in the conqueſt of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> for that the new Duke, having laid down his <hi>Cardinals</hi> Hat, and taken to Wife <hi>Claudia,</hi> Siſter-in-law of <hi>Carlo,</hi> gave occaſion to <hi>Richelieu</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or feign jealouſies, and to require in pledge for ſecurity <hi>La Motha,</hi> the only place that remained at his diſpoſe. The Duke now ſaw, that his faults and the ſuſpicions of <hi>France</hi> would laſt as long as any part of the Country reſted in his power. Therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the place, goes to <hi>Luneville,</hi> a Houſe of Pleaſure in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But encompaſſed immediately with Guards, he was required to return to <hi>Nancy,</hi> under pretence of greater ſecurity. It was not in his power to refuſe it; but quickly perceiving himſelf to he kept a Priſoner there, he contrives, deceiving the Guards, to free himſelf from the ſlavery, and with his Wife going out by a little Gate in the habit of Gardiners, got to <hi>Beſanzon,</hi> and thence to <hi>Florence</hi> to be far diſtant from places ſuſpected by <hi>France.</hi> The Cardinal, not to be wearied in purſuing advantages and anger, cauſed <hi>la Motha</hi> to be beſieged, which, the Governour being in an occaſion killed, was rendred.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lorrainers</hi> in this manner brought low, <hi>Orleans</hi> remained at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> but deprived of a great ſupport, and little ſatisfied with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> becauſe having ſigned certain Covenants, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in them, <hi>Not to make any accord with his Brother without their knowledge and conſent, and obliged himſelf to remain in their party, and herein to imploy his Credit and Arms; the</hi> Spaniards <hi>on the other ſide being to furniſh money wherewith to raiſe and maintain an Army, with which he might be able to attacque</hi> France, <hi>and conquer places, whilſt they with another body of an Army ſhould give jealouſie to the Frontiers.</hi> But the Marqueſs <hi>d'Aitona</hi> having not been able to
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:53750:204"/>
make good theſe agreements, by reaſon of greater diſtractions, and principally by the threatnings of the <hi>French</hi> from the ſide of <hi>Trier, Orleans</hi> through wearineſs and inconſtancy, and above all perſwaded by <hi>Puilaurens</hi> his Favourite, agrees with the King his Brother. <hi>Pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laurens</hi> had been gained by <hi>Richelieu;</hi> ſo that as he, in compliance with his own loves to the Princeſs of <hi>Falsburg,</hi> another Siſter of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi>'s, had already driven on <hi>Orleans</hi> to the Marriage with <hi>Margaret,</hi> ſo now weary of thoſe inclinations, and baited by the Cardinal with promiſes of great recompence, and the Marriage with his own Niece, perſwades him to leave his Mother and Wife at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn by ſtealth into the Kingdom. But <hi>Puilaurens</hi> was not long ere he felt the puniſhment of his over-much credulity; for being allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Marriage, and at that very time new offences being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and he condemned to loſe his life, his death diſſolved it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> remained by the eſcape of <hi>Orleans</hi> fruſtrated of their hopes, and the ſurpriſe of the Iſlands of <hi>Eres</hi> in <hi>Provenze</hi> was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, contrived by them to be executed, under Imperial Colours, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of ſuccours and diverſion for <hi>Lorrain.</hi> For five and twenty Gallies, ſeven great Ships, with Souldiers and all other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, being come from <hi>Naples</hi> into <hi>Sicily</hi> to joyn with other eight Gallies, and to take on Board Souldiers, found things there in ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle readineſs, that they were forced to put it off till the next year. From ſuch proviſions and ſo great deſigns was eaſily to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that ſome great motion to War was near. And therefore the <hi>Venetians</hi> failed not to attempt by their endeavours, effectually imployed by <hi>Luigi Contarini</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Giovanni Giuſtiniani</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> to pacifie their minds, and moderate animoſities; but the evil being at the point of breaking forth, was rather provoked, ſo that all diligence became fruitleſs, and reaſons were heard, but not conſidered, both the Crowns endeavouring rather by allurements and promiſes to bring the Republick into their opinions, and change the Mediation into an adhering either to the one or other ſide.</p>

               <p>THE ſlaughters and calamities, which diſhonouring Chriſtendom, and deſtroying <hi>Europe,</hi> have made fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous the rancour of two great Miniſters, will give poſterity juſt occaſion, to number this rather amongſt the moſt doleful than a renowned year, in which <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> came to an open breach, and gave a beginning to a long War, with memorable accidents and bloody ſucceſſes, intermingled with fallacious Treaties, viciſſitudes of Arms, inſurrections of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the mockeries of Fortune. It was already diſcovered, that the emulation betwixt <hi>Richelieu</hi> and <hi>Olivares</hi> could no longer remain concealed; neither wanted there on either ſide occaſions or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texts: for the Fleet in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Armies in <hi>Spain,</hi> the Treaties with <hi>Orleans,</hi> the ſtirring up the diſcontented, abundantly diſcovered what engine was preparing by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and on the other ſide, the poſſeſſion of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the progreſſes in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Treaties with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the Subſidies to <hi>Holland,</hi> pointed out what deſigns the <hi>French</hi> were contriving.

                  <hi>Richelieu</hi> was happy, who in theſe preludiums of War experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in every Treaty the more lucky deſtiny, to conclude with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> the League offenſive and defenſive, which ſo much awakened in the World diſcourſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and fame, and ſtirred up in the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> ſo many appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and fears; for by the Articles of the ſame, <hi>The Provinces in obedience to the King of</hi> Spain <hi>were to be aſſaulted by the Confederates, with Forces united of fifty thouſand Foot and ten thouſand Horſe, after that by a publick Manifeſt they ſhould be invited, and for three months their anſwer expected, to ſhake off the Yoak, and to unite themſelves with others in one common body of liberty, ſaving to every one their priviledges, and in particular their Religion: but when that time was past, they deſigned them a pray to their Arms, and the Conqueſts were to be divided;</hi> Lutzemburg, Namur, Henault, Artois, <hi>and the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of</hi> Cambray <hi>were to be yielded to</hi> France, <hi>with a part of</hi> Flanders <hi>on this ſide, of a line which was to be drawn from</hi> Blankenburg <hi>betwixt</hi> Bridges <hi>and</hi> Dam, <hi>taking in</hi> Ruplemond; <hi>the reſt was to belong to the States of</hi> Holland, <hi>with a promiſe to leave the Catholick Religion every where in the ſtate they found it. It was agreed, not to make Peace or Truce but by common conſent, and not to admit of any terms till the</hi> Spaniards <hi>were first totally driven out of the</hi> Low Countries. <hi>They propoſed to attacque Towns in an alternative order, one of the reparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to</hi> France, <hi>and then another of thoſe aſſigned to</hi> Holland, <hi>but leaving the choice to the will of the</hi> Generals. <hi>A Fleet at Sea was over and above this agreed upon, and the</hi> French <hi>were to declare War to the Emperour, and every body elſe, that upon this account ſhould moleſt the States.</hi> All this tended to give a great ſtroke, if in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the War the intereſts of the Confederates had met with a parity, as in the Treaty their minds were equally diſpoſed and their wills agreeing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> coming to the knowledge hereof, to the Pope and in all Courts laid load upon the <hi>French</hi> with bitter invectives, as if they would expoſe Religion in pray to the Hereticks, and that, not contented to ſee it through the countenance of their aſſiſtance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> they went about to extirpate it alſo in thoſe Provinces, where, under the Government of their Monarchy, the true Worſhip was retained. But all that availing little, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their confidence in Arms, rather than complaints, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine upon prevention, by ſhutting that door, by which the <hi>French,</hi> aſſaulting the back-ſide of the Provinces, intended to bring their Army to join with that of <hi>Holland.</hi> The Count of <hi>Embden,</hi> then ſent by the Cardinal <hi>Infanta</hi> to attempt the gaining of the Citadel of <hi>Triers,</hi> ſucceeded in the ſurpriſe of it by night, through the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, with which <hi>Arnoud,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Governour, kept it; the Garriſon in the exploit being cut to pieces, and the Elector remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Priſoner; for that, hindred by the Gout, he was not able to make his eſcape. He was ſent to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to give account to the Emperour of his putting himſelf under the protection of the <hi>French,</hi> and to have introduced into his Towns ſtranger Garriſons, contrary
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:53750:206"/>
to the conſtitutions of the Empire. At the ſame time, Fortune ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding beginnings, Colonel <hi>Bamberg,</hi> who, after a long Siege, had rendred <hi>Phillipsburg</hi> to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> by whom it was afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered over to <hi>France,</hi> by the favour of the Ice paſſing the ditch, happily ſurpriſed that very ſtrong place.</p>
               <p>At two ſo great and unexpected blows the <hi>French</hi> were greatly moved, but withal believing the occaſion favourable to publiſh the War againſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> formerly reſolved on, they ſent to the <hi>Infanta</hi> to require with the reſtitution of the Country, the liberty of the Elector. But he referring the anſwer to the Emperour, as profeſſing to have only obeyed his orders, a Herald was ſent by King <hi>Lewis</hi> to <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to denounce, in the ancient forms, War, and almoſt at the ſame time moved, in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> his Troops. The <hi>French</hi> Army, by the Mareſhals of <hi>Chaſtiglion</hi> and <hi>Brezé,</hi> were rendeſvouz'd near <hi>Mezieres,</hi> and as it is uſual in the firſt beginnings, eſpecially when a War is undertaken through animoſity and revenge, all things did ſuperabound, ſo that the number of the Army exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Agreement, and the warlike proviſions ſeemed to be greater than was needful. For <hi>France,</hi> being at the height of reputation and power, reckoned at that time to have under its Colours, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, one hundred and thirty thouſand Foot and fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, with an infinite number of Artillery, and abundance of all other proviſions. The <hi>French</hi> then marching towards <hi>Maeſtricht</hi> with above thirty thouſand fighting men and forty pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> with weak Forces near to <hi>Aveſnes,</hi> attempts to diſpute the paſſage, and was with much ſlaughter beaten, ſo that going on without reſiſtance, they joined <hi>Orange,</hi> who waited for them with twenty thouſand Foot and ſix thouſand Horſe, and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore pieces of Artillery. The Army appeared formidable for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and valour, and the world already ſuppoſed the felicity of the enterpriſe, equal to the Force. But Victuals for ſo great a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude being quickly wanting, the Army began to devour it ſelf through want, and to be conſumed with ſickneſs and ſuffering.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brabant</hi> was invaded, and <hi>Tirlemont,</hi> a great Town but weak, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by force, experienced, with cruelty in the ſlaughter and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the firſt fury of Military licenſe. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their groſs near to <hi>Lovain,</hi> to cover that City, which is of a great circuit, but weak, and, together with the City, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try near to it. The Confederates, to draw them to a Battel, made ſhew to advance towards <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> not without hope, but that in the univerſal conſternation, they might have the luck to take it. But <hi>Orange,</hi> retarding the march, gave time to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to draw nearer to it. The Confederates then commanded their march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lovain,</hi> and on a ſudden beſiege it with great violence, but the defence was no leſs vigorous, maintained by the Baron of <hi>Grob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendonk</hi> the Governour, with the aſſiſtance of a good number of Scholars of that famous Univerſity, who ſtrengthened the Garriſon. The fierceneſs of the aſſailants being hereby abated, the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to waſte; for the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> ſupplying their Army punctually
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:53750:206"/>
with whatſoever they had need of, kept Victuals from the <hi>French,</hi> who, though by force and courage they were able to overcome any danger, found that hunger and neceſſity was an enemy invincible. Many dyed, and the reſt disbanding, were in great numbers killed by the Peaſants; ſo that the Forces being weakned, and Victuals wanting, the Generals were forced to raiſe the Siege, and give leave to thoſe that were alive, every one to provide for his ſafety and eſcape. The Commanders, and the Reliques of the Army, were reduced to imbark in <hi>Holland,</hi> ſcoffed at by the people, and ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that of ſo many men, which aſpired to ſo great Conqueſts, ſo ſmall a remainder appeared, and they in diſorder, fugitives, and in ſo faint a condition.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but as the United Provinces, in making of the League, conſented to any conditions, which might oblige the <hi>French</hi> to an open breach with <hi>Spain;</hi> ſo having obtained their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe abhorred no one thing more, than to have them, inſtead of friends, neighbours. To the common concerns of the Provinces was added the private reſentments of the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> for that <hi>Richelieu,</hi> amidſt flatteries and confidences, had ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore endeavoured to ſurpriſe in <hi>France</hi> the Town of <hi>Orange</hi> it ſelf; but the blow not ſucceeding, he quickly ſilenced the fact and noiſe of it. But the other diſſembling with equal artifice, reſerved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for an opportunity to be even with him, and now he enjoyed this, that if by taking moſt important Towns from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he had gained by Arms the glory of valour and courage, in over-reaching <hi>Richelieu</hi> now in wit, the world attributed to him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of great policy and prudence. Yet the Cardinal, having, by reaſon of the War undertaken, need of the adherence of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> and friendſhip of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to apply himſelf to the greater, neglected leſſer revenges. This acting againſt <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> with the noiſe and appearance of better ſucceſs than was met with, had diſpleaſed the King of <hi>England,</hi> who willingly could not ſuffer the greatning of the Crown of <hi>France</hi> in thoſe parts. Putting therefore, on that occaſion, a Fleet to Sea, obſerved the iſſue of things, and the <hi>Emperour,</hi> conſidering of what importance thoſe Provinces were to the common intereſt of <hi>Germany,</hi> ſends ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and four thouſand Horſe with <hi>Piccolominy</hi> to the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Infante.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Army was no ſooner diſperſed, but the fear, which at firſt troubled the Subjects of <hi>Spain,</hi> pierced interchangeably into the heart of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> For the Count of <hi>Embden,</hi> by order of the <hi>Infante,</hi> ſurpriſed <hi>Schinche Schans,</hi> which lies in a ſituation above any other important, where the <hi>Rhine,</hi> divided into two Branches, keeps on the right hand its name, and on the left aſſumes that of <hi>Waaghe;</hi> ſo that the Fort, commanding the Navigation and the Dikes, can overflow the Country; gives an entrance into the <hi>Bottowe,</hi> and, on the one ſide cutting off the Towns and Provinces which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the River, opens on the other paſſage into the bowels of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Orange</hi> comes immediately to incloſe it with a ſtrong Siege,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53750:207"/>
drawing abundance of Works longſt the ſide of the River. So great a flame of War betwixt two ſo powerful Kings could not be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only within thoſe Provinces; but ſpreading it ſelf every where, broke forth alſo in <hi>Italy,</hi> taking its beginning in the <hi>Griſons,</hi> where <hi>Monſieur de la Lande,</hi> for the cuſtody of the Paſſes, for ſome time paſt kept three Regiments of that Nation and ſome <hi>French;</hi> and now having ſent <hi>a l'improviſto,</hi> by the Mountain of <hi>Spluga,</hi> ſix Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, poſſeſſes without oppoſition <hi>Chiavanna, Riva, il Saſſo Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beio,</hi> and thoſe other places longſt the Lake heretofore named; then <hi>Rohan</hi> following by the way of <hi>Poſchiavo</hi> with five thouſand Foot and four hundred Horſe gets <hi>Morbegno,</hi> and every other place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in poſſeſſion of all the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the Counties adjacent. The Cardinal <hi>Albornoz,</hi> who after the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s departure governed <hi>Milan,</hi> by profeſſion averſe to Arms, was upon this emergency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure confuſed. Sends nevertheleſs Troops towards <hi>Lago di Como,</hi> but expected his chief ſuccours and diverſions from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and no one thing could happen more diſturbing to the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians,</hi> than to ſee the paſſages ſhut, and communication inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> knew, that though the ſurpriſe happened to be eaſie, yet it was impoſſible to keep what they had gotten without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> The Miniſters therefore of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> bringing to remembrance the preſſures and agreements for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption formerly of thoſe Paſſes, demonſtrated the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, exhorting the Republick to take Arms, and participate of the Conqueſts. But thoſe of <hi>Spain</hi> extolling thoſe generous Titles attributed to the Republick it ſelf, of the Shield and Defence of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> endeavoured to ſtir it up againſt the <hi>French,</hi> as the unſeaſonable incendiary of ſo great a diſcord. The Senate in the preſent conſtitution of things, ſeeming to have nothing to hope nor fear from Strangers, reſolved to keep themſelves in neutrality, enjoying Peace at leaſt in their own Country, though their endeavours had not been ſufficient to divert the War elſewhere. They permitted the <hi>French</hi> to draw Victuals out of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing places, and the paſſage of Corn which they fetched out of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania,</hi> and beſides for ſome Cannon bought out of Ships in <hi>Venice;</hi> and conſented to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the tranſport, from <hi>Trieſte</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> of <hi>German</hi> Souldiers in Barks one by one, and without Arms; which a little before having been demanded in the Name of <hi>Lodowick</hi> Prince of <hi>Venoſa,</hi> who deſired to make the Levy, had been denied. As to other things, fortifying the paſſages and their own Confines with a good number of Souldiers, and by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Luigi Giorgio</hi> General in <hi>Terra firma,</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtian Veniero</hi> into <hi>Valcamonica,</hi> and <hi>Michael Priuli</hi> Proveditor into the <hi>Veroneſe,</hi> they ſtood obſerving what would happen.</p>
               <p>Surely the <hi>French</hi> might have reaped great advantages, if while the minds of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters were wavering, by reaſon of the ſurpriſe of the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the weak condition they then were in, the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> by the way of <hi>Piedmont</hi> had been attacqued by them. But
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53750:207"/>
whilſt they lingered, the better to ſettle agreements with other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> firm, which ordinarily favours the weaker ſide, gave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> opportunity to make Levies in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> call aſſiſtance from <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and receive thoſe from the <hi>Grand Duke,</hi> wherewith for the Inveſtiture of <hi>Vienna</hi> he is obliged to aid the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> whenſoever attacqued. <hi>Monſieur de Bellievre,</hi> ſent from King <hi>Lewis,</hi> Ambaſſadour Extraordinary, into <hi>Italy,</hi> coming to <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> obliged <hi>Vittorio</hi> to declare himſelf, to joyn Forces, and enter into the League.</p>
               <p>If the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> heretofore conſiderable by reaſon of ſituation, were wont, by the credit they had with both ſides, to invite to the War ſometimes the one, and ſometimes the other Crown, it ſeemed at preſent, that they could do no other but ſecond the <hi>French,</hi> being on the one ſide environed with <hi>Pignerol,</hi> and on the other with <hi>Monferrat.</hi> The Duke grew more and more jealous from the paſs it ſelf, that neceſſity forced him to remain united with that Crown; for if by the <hi>French</hi> the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> ſhould be conquered, he knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at their mercy, rather loſt than expoſed. Nevertheleſs being a friend in peace, it behoved him to make himſelf alſo a Companion in War, not without ſome hope, that joyning Arms, and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Councils, he might arrive at his ends, and direct them to his advantage. So adhering to the <hi>French</hi> in Name, and in Maxims to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he became in concluſion troubleſom to theſe, and of little advantage to the others. The Duke <hi>d'Alviti</hi> was ſent by <hi>Albornoz</hi> to <hi>Turin,</hi> to divert him from ſigning the League, but in vain; for though many believed, that he paſſed with him concerts leſs publick, but more effectual, yet after ſome delays he cloſed with the <hi>French. Bellievre</hi> then goes to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who in the heat of his years and paſſions, greedy of Glory and War, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo far advanced a Treaty with the <hi>French,</hi> that little of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remained to the Ambaſſadour fully to conclude it, to the ſo much greater reſentment of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they knew they had unſeaſonably provoked rather than frighted him with ſcorns and threatnings to promote to the Government of the Country <hi>Alexander</hi> his elder Brother, who, as dumb, judged by the Kindred incapable of the Succeſſion, was kept in the Citadel of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> not without jealouſie by the Duke; and although every body condemned <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> that undertaking War with the more powerful, he exerciſed rather the warmth of his courage, than the prudence and vigour of his ability; nevertheleſs the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> conceived ſtrong ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, leſt the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> ſhould be aſſaulted in flank, ſuccours from <hi>Naples</hi> be hindred, and <hi>French</hi> introduced into <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and perhaps alſo into <hi>Sabioneda.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> ſet himſelf to ſale to both the Crowns; ſo acceptable and regarded did the deſire of prevailing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

It was agreed, not to make Peace without the reſtitution of that, which by the</hi> Spaniards <hi>might be taken from the Confederates. As to conqueſts which might happen, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was deferred, till the enterpriſe on the</hi> Milaneſe <hi>ſhould be at an end:</hi> leaving every one of the united Princes uncertain what was to be the reward of their undertaking, and not out of fear, leſt in the concluſion the more powerful ſhould keep to himſelf the arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, after they had diſcovered the fixed reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to ſtand neutral, had deferred as the laſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to preſs the <hi>Republick,</hi> and get her to come into the League, believing that more than from reaſon would be powerful to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it, not ſo much the example of the other Princes united, as the intereſt and the conceit, that in the taking of <hi>Milan</hi> it behoved them alſo to have a ſhare in it, to greaten it ſelf, and injoy the ſpoils. And therefore they invited them, not as others with uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hopes, but with expreſs propoſitions to give them in the <hi>Valte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Tirano,</hi> conſent to them paſſage into, and a League with the <hi>Griſons,</hi> and in the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> the <hi>Comaſco, la Giara d' Adda,</hi> with whatever more ſhe would chuſe.

                  <hi>under the protection of a moſt juſt King, and the care of a provident and vigilant Miniſter, is in that degree of happineſs and power, that if in other times it was not to be overcome but by it ſelf, being now united at peace, obedient, and armed is rendred ſuperiour to it ſelf. And now I ſhall tell you, that nothing is wanting to its felicity, but that which the Kings goodneſs will have wanting, and that is the communicating his good things to his friends; the dividing felicity it ſelf with his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. The Arms of</hi> France, <hi>heretofore implored by the Princes of</hi> Italy, <hi>deſired by your ſelves, always ready for ſuccours of the cauſes moſt juſt, fatally alſo in paſt Ages the Reſtorers of</hi> Italy, <hi>are now offered to you, not to redeem, (for we already number that Ornament amongst our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts) but to ſecure the perpetual quiet, liberty, and dignity of</hi> Italy, <hi>which hath hitherto coſt you ſo many cares, and our ſelves ſo much blood. I openly declare it to be the chief point of my inſtructions and of your counſels, that the King renounces the very thought of retaining any thing in</hi> Italy. <hi>Let the Spoils, Dominions, and Provinces be yours, ours ſhall he the labours, the charges, and the dangers, let the Glory be ſufficient to the</hi> French <hi>Nation, to know how to overcome their Enemies, and ſo give Victories to their Friends. Your Republick, beloved by the King, as Coetancan with his Monarchy, the firſt begotten of his Confederates, the firſt-fruits of his affection in</hi> Italy; <hi>what greater pledge can you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the Royal inclination, than to be intreated to gather the fruits of our labours, to increaſe your Empire, and extend your Confines upon the ruine of his implacable and ancient Enemies? Let us, I pray, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not without aſtoniſhment, the diſparity of the Maxims and Genius of the two Nations, whereof one by affection, the other by neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offers you friendſhip. Who knows not the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>a people cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of their own, and greedy of what is anothers, who by ambition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes, and by avarice and nature holds faſt? We on the other ſide, prodigal of our ſelves, if in War we obſerve juſtice, in conquering we exerciſe moderation. How many provocations have we ſuffered before we declared our ſelves Enemies to</hi> Spain, <hi>the Prejudices, the Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, diſſembled to an exceſs of patience, had rendred the</hi> Auſtrians <hi>ſo bold, that to oppreſs our Friends, and inſult upon our ſelves, was turned into a Maxim of their haughtineſs, as the intereſt of the</hi> French <hi>ſufferance. You, O Fathers, your ſelves are Witneſſes, how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you have ſtirred us up to juſt reſentments, and I will ſpeak it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhame, becauſe</hi> France <hi>appeared then alienated from it ſelf, reproved us with reaſon of negligence. But now my King, who can with his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er meaſure his Generoſity, with what motive hath he begun the preſent War, but to render Juſtice to his Friends, unjuſtly violated by the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Arms? Though he hath been willing frequently to diſſemble the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences done to himſelf, he hath not been able to ſuffer the injuries done to his Confederates: And who will doubt, that the War will not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in future by the ſame Arts with which it begins, and if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful ſurpriſe of an Elector protected, be by my King revenged with ſo great preparations and ſo great charges, what ſhall not his Friends be, who ſhall adhere to him, to be defended by his Royal conſtancy, and
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53750:209"/>
made partakers of his Victories and Triumphs? Certainly, if I conſider the preſent propoſition, 'tis needleſs that I ſeek other examples to render the Magnanimity of the</hi> French <hi>Kings, and in particular of</hi> Lewis <hi>Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious. Does he invite you to be his Companions in the enterpriſe of the</hi> Milaneſe? <hi>but he gives to you and the other Confederates the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of it, and of the other Territories of</hi> Italy, <hi>to which the Rights of our Kings are ſo clear and ſo juſt. Thoſe that in the gaining and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of them coſt us ſo much blood, are your conqueſts. Believe me, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that if we expect Heaven ſhould preſcribe us Councils, it cannot ſuggeſt it to us with clearer words, than by ſhewing us the Conjuncture, and ſupplying with Forces for it. But why do I ſpeak of Forces? It ſufficeth that the Republick contribute herein to it its name. If, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, this be ſufficient, it is almoſt no other but this alone that I ſue for; becauſe</hi> Italy, <hi>weary of Wars, of Jealouſies, and Diſcords, which for ſo long time her conſtant enemies have ſcattered there, being now aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and united, is willing at one blow alone to caſt off the yoke, and if your Senate have ſo many times generouſly ſollicited, that your example might be followed, nothing now is required from you but approbation and conſent. I diſſemble it not; almoſt all the Princes of</hi> Italy <hi>are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready either open Enemies to</hi> Spain, <hi>or ſecret Friends to</hi> France; <hi>and expect nothing elſe to declare themſelves but the credit of your prudence. In your hands then reſts the Force, the Counſel, and the Deſtiny of</hi> Italy. <hi>I call not to your memories the ancient Miſchiefs, recent Jealouſies, and perpetual Suſpicions. It ſuffices to ſay, that the Domination of</hi> Spain, <hi>dreadful to all, fears all; that it hates thoſe it fears, and that it is equally inſatiable in hatreds, as it is exceſſive in revenges. And now what elſe more can be ſaid, but that it is rather preſerved by the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of others than its own power. The</hi> Auſtrians <hi>invaded, and every where divided, have rather a proof of the weight than the force of their boundleſs power, and can no longer govern the vaſt bulk of their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The</hi> Milaneſe <hi>in particular, where they have placed the ſeat of the War and of their ſtrength alſo, which for ſo many years hath vexed</hi> Italy, <hi>who can repair it? <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprovided of Forces, confounded in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, aſſailed from ſo many parts, beyond all ſuccours, and if you will, poſſibility of eſcape. I know the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Miniſters will not fail to allure you; but believe me, that their flatteries are not for nought. They proceed from the guiltineſs of their preſent weakneſs; from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of paſt injuries. So the Serpent benummed in Winter, hath its venom dulled, but not extinguiſhed; when the rays of the Sun touch it again in the Spring, it turns and windes it ſelf, and at laſt breathes forth death. And what will the</hi> Spaniards <hi>do elſe, if propitious Fortune ſhould breath again, but vent the revenges, the reſentments, and the offences, which during adverſity they keep concealed in the heart? Do not believe, that pretended injuries are forgotten, nor that oblivion or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration can be in minds accuſtomed to inſolence and ſole arbitrement. My King will think to have done enough, and to have ſatisfied what is due to Glory and Himſelf, whilſt this will ſerve Him and</hi> Italy <hi>for the laſt tryal whether ſhe do know and be willing patiently to ſuffer ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude.</hi>

That is enough to perſwade me, that the moſt pious inſtitutions of your generous Anceſtors living in you, it may be ſuperfluous, that I here exhort you to that, which by a common concert, grave prudence, and a religious conſcience perſwades you to. I ſee the</hi> French <hi>Miniſters wandring through</hi> Italy, <hi>I perceive they are in this City; but, if elſewhere they meet with equally to their deſires, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, the avarice of Princes, nay and ingratitude it ſelf for benefits conferred upon many by my King, they will find here prudence, juſtice, and moderation united. Let it be the glory of your Republick to make War for Peace, and, having found it, to preſerve it; as it will be the eternal blame of the Crown of</hi> France, <hi>to diſturb and confound it. It cannot be denied, but that the genius of that Nation reſembles the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of fire, which, if it reacheth not to ſomething elſe, burns and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes it ſelf. What, I pray, provokes to this preſent War? The Affairs poſſibly of</hi> Trier, <hi>a thing rather alledged than true; as though, whilst the Peace was treating in</hi> Ratisbone, <hi>the Treaties with the King of</hi> Sweden <hi>would not have been aſſented to, and when the execution was concerted in</hi> Chievaſco, <hi>and that the</hi> Auſtrians, <hi>with the juſt ſaith of Princes, rendred Countries, Towns, and Poſts, the</hi> French <hi>had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned ſurpriſes, treacheries, and injuries. God, the Judge of Kings, and who, called upon in juſt witneſs of Agreements, is a ſevere revenger of deceit, doth now condemn and puniſh them. Religion, and the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the</hi> Auſtrians, <hi>triumphs in</hi> Germany. <hi>In</hi> Flanders <hi>the Heavens, the Elements, Nature it ſelf fight for us. We ſee Armies overcome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fighting, we hear of places taken without a Siege. What elſe can be expected in</hi> Italy, <hi>where the cauſe is ſo much the more unjuſt, as the pretexts are farther fetched? To what tend the offers and propoſitions of the Miniſters of</hi> France, <hi>but to render this happy Country a deplorable Theatre of eternal War? This, O Fathers, is the thing they would be at; to overcome you with your own very blood, and with a fallacious friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that by ſubduing all, they might ſee you all Enemies amongst your ſelves. I will not argue the point, whether, as they imagine it, it be ſo eaſie to drive the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>potency out of</hi> Italy. <hi>It being founded upon lawful titles, confirmed by time, uſe, and its own ſtrength, is like a great Oak which ſtands firm upon its own weight and ſtrength; the winds may ſhake and toſs it to and fro, but they ſpend their breath in the conteſt before that is weary of reſiſting, and if it do fall, it cruſhes at the ſame time whoever attempts to violate the roots. But let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their ſpecious propoſitions, of advantages, Conqueſts, and Spoils, which I would rather ſee authoriſed by examples, than amplified with partial diſcourſes. Which way ſoever I turn my ſelf, either to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acts of old, or the memorials of later times, I find nothing but ſad accidents of Princes oppreſſed, of places taken, and Provinces uſurped; and, if what hath hapned in</hi> Lorrain, Trier, <hi>and</hi> Germany <hi>ſute not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as foreign to</hi> Italy, <hi>enquire of</hi> Savoy, <hi>and ſatisfie your ſelves out of your own Annals, that the</hi> French <hi>being Neighbours muſt either be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53750:210"/>
or Enemies. Will you then, O Fathers, give your aſſiſtance to them, who in the War having licenſe for their end, and ambition for their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, will turn againſt you thoſe Forces, to which your power and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhall have given vigour and ſucceſs? I know very well what they have given others to underſtand; that perhaps, which they go about to make you believe, that they will make the Conqueſts, and leave you the advantages of the Victories. But if they take the riſe of the War from the breach of faith, do you believe, that Victory, which uſes to make all men inſolent, will metamorphiſe them into Religion and Modeſty? If they think the</hi> Italian <hi>Princes unable to manage a War without their aid and aſſiſtance, it muſt be their Armies then that muſt beſiege places, and garriſon them when taken, and having once (God preſerve</hi> Italy <hi>from that unhappy deſtiny) excluded my King, who ſhall be the Judge, who ſhall decide cauſes, who regulate the Confines, and who require again what is depoſited? I will not vainly boaſt what the power of</hi> Spain <hi>hath contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the honour, ſecurity, and quiet of</hi> Italy. <hi>As to us, your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines have always remained unviolable; within our own have we confined our thoughts and Armies, ſollicitous only for our own, and the common Peace. My King hath always been deſirous to confederate Empire with reaſon, and eſtabliſh his greatneſs in tranquillity. But the preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, which every where ſhake</hi> Europe, <hi>do confound divine Worſhip, propagate Hereſie, oppreſs Countries, and ſerve for an argument and proof what will be the progreſs, if ſuch be the firſt ſteps of the</hi> French <hi>Armies. I know, that the artifices of our Enemies have in times paſt ſcattered jealouſies, introduced diſguſts, depainted ſhadows, and every thing being ſuſpected which remained a ſecret, have cauſed diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and diſcords; but the end hath been the judge of the intentions, and the work. Great Princes have great wrong done them, when they want the true knowledge of their Counſels, believe all upon ſame, and ſuſpect every thing. Of that I ſhall ſay no more; becauſe it is now, at laſt, time that we lay aſide ſuſpicions, wrath, and enmities, which have hitherto ſo often reciprocally deceived us. I cannot give this great and wiſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick a more ſafe pledge of the Kings friendſhip, than offering it an union with him, and ſuing for the bond of your alliance. If in your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection conſiſts the Peace of</hi> Italy, <hi>obligation perſwades you, cuſtom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts you and intereſt it ſelf conſtrains you. My King will believe his oppoſition more fortunate, if he ſhall have for his companions thoſe, whom he refuſes not for the Judges of his intentions, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpires of the Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though, from ſuch endeavours, mens minds for ſome days were variouſly moved, yet being communicated to the Senate, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent was unanimous, not to change counſel, but to adjuſt according to Neutrality the anſwers, with equal eſteem to the invitations of both the Kings, equally affectionated and prized, and with exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to Peace, for the procuring whereof, in the partiality of ſo many others, who divided <hi>Europe</hi> almoſt equally, the indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Republick was judged neceſſary, if not ſerviceable. With theſe reſolutions the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were more contented, than the <hi>French</hi> appayed, to whom it appeared, as if, amidſt domeſtick cares,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:53750:210"/>
the Republick had laid aſide the foreign, and that it was not againſt having the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo it were in a condition compati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the liberty of that Country.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>Bellievre</hi> departed from <hi>Venice,</hi> foreſeeing that the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick would be more and more averſe from entring into the League, by reaſon of the harſh uſage of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he beſought them to admit of ſome moderations; but the Senate made no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to his inſtances. The Confederates then in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> taking the Field in the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Duke <hi>Vittorio,</hi> being Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſſimo of the League, and <hi>Crequi</hi> commanding the <hi>French</hi> Army, paſs the <hi>Seſia,</hi> poſſeſſing with a great effort the Fort <hi>della Villata,</hi> and the tracings of certain old Trenches. At the ſame time the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> ſending to the other ſide of the <hi>Po</hi> four Companies of Horſe with Musketiers behind them, cauſed <hi>Codagno</hi> to be pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged, to vent private revenge againſt the Houſe of <hi>Trivultia,</hi> to whom the Town belongs. Upon theſe invaſions, and for fear of greater diſaſters, the people of the <hi>Millaneſe</hi> being in confuſion, fled in Troops, for refuge, into the Country of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> with ſuch of their goods, as time and convenience permitted, or that the value moved them to carry away.</p>
               <p>To ſay truth, had the Republick made an attaque from its own frontier, it looked as if there would have been no remedy or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. So that their moderation was extolled by many, and the Catholick King himſelf to <hi>Giovanni Giuſtiani</hi> their Ambaſſador confeſſed: <hi>That he acknowledged the preſervation of the</hi> Milaneſe <hi>from the generoſity of the Senate, which ran the ſame courſe unrequired, preſerving friendſhip with them in their dangers, whoſe hatred they had not formerly, in their greateſt power, feared, nor tolerated their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Crequi,</hi> after ſeveral conſultations, laying Siege to <hi>Valenza,</hi> thought, by the gaining of it, a door would be opened into the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> for the enjoying the conveniencies of a good part of the Country beyond the <hi>Po;</hi> Duke <hi>Edward</hi> would be animated, and <hi>Vittorio</hi> no leſs, to co-operate and join Forces. He ſuppoſed the attacque would be ſhort and quickly diſpatched, notwithſtanding that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had brought ſome renfort into it. But he quickly perceived, that <hi>Franciſco del Cardina</hi> making a brave defence, there was need of a ſtronger Army to take it. The Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> with four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and a thouſand Horſe, paſſing through the <hi>Tortoneſe,</hi> with ſo much the more faſte, for having beaten by the way ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops that attempted to hinder him, had joined with him. He of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who at firſt had not approved of the ingagement, lingred for many days. At laſt, ſending the Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> before with ſome part of his Troops, himſelf arrives with the reſt, which in all made a body of betwixt five and ſix thouſand Souldiers. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this interim, <hi>Crequi,</hi> having not been able, for want of men, to perfect the circumvallation of the place, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had enjoyed all conveniencies to bring ſuccours into it. But with the arrival of the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> being environed on both ſides the River, the taking
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53750:211"/>
it ſeemed ſecure, if the emulation and contention betwixt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates had not weakened their Force and Counſels. Whereupon, the taking of the out-works going faintly on, <hi>Antonio Sotello</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>di Calada</hi> took courage to fall into the quarters of <hi>Parma,</hi> with ſo great ſucceſs, that, though repulſed, they did him moſt remarkable miſchief, there being killed, amongſt others, <hi>Ric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardo Avogardo,</hi> a <hi>Breſcian</hi> of a very noble Family, General of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> Horſe. Upon this, <hi>Carlo Colonna</hi> alſo, who, till the arrival of <hi>Leganes</hi> out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> commanded the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, putting on reſolution incamps himſelf in the <hi>Lommelina,</hi> in a quarter near to the place beſieged, committing to the Marqueſs of <hi>Torrecuſe</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of certain Poſts advanced. The <hi>French,</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> paſſed to the other ſide of the <hi>Po,</hi> into the <hi>Savoyards</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to attempt to diſlodge him; but whilſt <hi>Torrecuſo,</hi> ſeconded by <hi>Colonna,</hi> amuſed the Enemy, five hundred Souldiers carrying cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proviſions, going out of <hi>Aleſſandria,</hi> entred into <hi>Valenza</hi> on the other ſide, through the quarters ill guarded by the <hi>Parmeſians</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> Which <hi>Crequi</hi> underſtanding, fearing leſt the beſieged with this re-inforcement might fall into his own quarter, returns thither. And <hi>Colonna,</hi> now ſeeing the attempt of a general ſuccour ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, drew forth his Troops along the ſides of the <hi>Po,</hi> and recovers a Fort at the entry into <hi>del Ponte,</hi> firſt poſſeſſed by the <hi>Savoyards.</hi> From thence he thruſts into <hi>Valence</hi> what was needful; <hi>Vittorio</hi> looking on without oppoſition, and <hi>Crequi,</hi> with a battery afar off, in vain endeavouring to hinder it.</p>
               <p>This relief taking away from the Confederates the hopes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering the place, obliges them, after fifty days Siege, to riſe and retire. Every one of the Chiefs deſirous not to be held the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour or cauſe of this ill ſucceſs, carried away with them their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and excuſes. <hi>Crequi</hi> highly taxes the faith of the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> as if that Duke, not caring to ſee a good iſſue of the Siege, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded Victuals, weakly aſſaulted the Poſts of <hi>Torrecuſe,</hi> and at laſt connived at the entrance of the ſuccours. On the other ſide <hi>Vitto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio</hi> imputes to <hi>Crequi</hi> want of activity and negligence, not only in the firſt motion of the Army, but in not hindring the entrance of the firſt ſuccours, complaining, that the <hi>French</hi> Army, much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the agreement, and than was neceſſary, had no other aim by ingaging themſelves but to ingage their friends.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was univerſally blamed for his heat and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experience, in being joined with a few Forces, and with uncertain and remote ſuccours againſt ſo powerful a King. The <hi>Pope,</hi> as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of thoſe States, had by the means of the Vice-Legate of <hi>Bologna</hi> admoniſhed him to deſiſt; but <hi>Edward</hi> not regarding the friendly office, and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> not preſſing it further, the appearance ſerved rather to ſatisfie the complaints of the Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> who accuſed the Pope of negligence, than effectually to promote Peace. The Duke, accompanied with few, goes to the Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> to inform it how things had paſſed, and to render to King <hi>Lewis</hi> and the Cardinal, in ſign of his conſtant adherance, a clear
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53750:211"/>
teſtimony of ſubmiſſion and reſpect. <hi>Vittorio,</hi> to cancel paſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, together with <hi>Crequi,</hi> takes in the <hi>Milaneſe, Candia,</hi> and <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirana,</hi> weak Towns; plants afterwards at <hi>Breme</hi> a Fort in a moſt convenient ſituation, under the favour whereof, not only the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, but the very bowels of the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> might be greatly infeſted. Thence gives way that the Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> getting the good will of the reliques of the Troops of <hi>Parma,</hi> now in the <hi>Piacentino,</hi> together with ſome <hi>French,</hi> ſhould take up their Winter-quarters there, when they had firſt overcome the oppoſition of ſome other <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops in the <hi>Tortoneſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeemed to many, that the ſucceſſes of the <hi>Campagnia</hi> had not been anſwerable to the deſigns and honour of the Confederates, and leſs to their Forces and the expectation of the World. But the conqueſt of the <hi>Valteline</hi> recompenſing in a great meaſure the ſcanty progreſs in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> kept ſtill the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> in trouble for <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> whereupon the Emperour giving knowledge of it to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> by his Letters, ſends Troops to drive out the <hi>French.</hi> It ſeeming difficult to force thoſe paſſages, a report was raiſed, That by the Mountain <hi>Tonale,</hi> or by the State of the Republick, they might ſecretly attempt paſſage. <hi>Rohan</hi> craftily augments the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, offering to come with all his Forces to their aſſiſtance, when the Confines ſhould be violated. But the fact gave quickly the lye to the report; for <hi>Fernamont,</hi> under the name of the Widow Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of <hi>Insbruck,</hi> having raiſed four thouſand Foot and four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, goes down to <hi>Bormio,</hi> and almoſt without oppoſition poſſeſſes the whole Country. Thence, ſtrengthened with more men, he deſigned to enter into the Valley ſo ſoon as he ſhould ſee <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellone</hi> ready on the other ſide to attempt the ſame. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> retarding the execution of the concert, the <hi>Germans</hi> retire into the Valley of <hi>Levin,</hi> where they found ſome moleſtation by the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At laſt, <hi>Serbellone</hi> being alſo in readineſs, <hi>Fernamont</hi> marches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tirano,</hi> where being encountred by <hi>Rohan</hi> at the Bridge of <hi>Mazzo</hi> over the <hi>Adda,</hi> he was beaten, and many ſlain. If the Bridge had been broken in time, almoſt all the <hi>Germans</hi> had been cut to pieces. The glory and advantage notwithſtanding on the <hi>French</hi> ſide was great; for that inferiour in number, through the valour of the Duke, the knowledge of the ſituations, and ſome ambuſhes, he prevailed upon the Enemy. Whilſt they were fighting on this ſide, <hi>Serbellone</hi> comes to <hi>Sondrio</hi> with three thouſand Foot, four hundred Horſe, and certain pieces of Cannon. <hi>Rohan</hi> without other refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but that which the ſatisfaction of the Victory brought, turns that way, ſending ſome Souldiers by the Mountains, which ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the time of the Battel might fall upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Rear and in the Flanks. But the Fame of the ſucceſs with the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> making more haſte than his march, perſwades <hi>Serbellone</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, under the favour of the Fort <hi>Fuentes.</hi> Then the <hi>French</hi> paſſing again the Valley, went to <hi>Bormio,</hi> and there the Marqueſs <hi>de Monto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier</hi> couragiouſly aſſaulting the Town, the Garriſon ſeeking to eſcape by flight, were defeated by the Guards, placed on the paſſages. But
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53750:212"/>
the Marqueſs wounded on the head with a ſtone, and in the ſide with Muſket-ſhot, ended his life there, with the reputation of a gallant perſon. The Fort alſo of <hi>Santa Maria</hi> was found abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the <hi>French</hi> demoliſhed it, intrenching every where the ways, to make the entrance difficult to the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the <hi>Germans,</hi> ſomewhat come to themſelves again, remaining with their groſs not above eight miles diſtant, ſent again, to recover their credit, ten Companies of Dragoons and three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Foot, who taking Quarters thereabouts, upon frequent occaſions, gave luſty Alarms to <hi>Rohan,</hi> who was imployed in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Fort at <hi>Tirano,</hi> where formerly the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> had placed one; whence the <hi>Germans,</hi> comprehending how difficult it would prove to ſend into the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> the ſuccours intended by the more direct way, reſolved to haſten away ſome Souldiers by the Bridge of <hi>Rapſvil,</hi> and through the Country of the Catholick <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons.</hi> The groſs, which amounted to ſix thouſand Foot and eight hundred Horſe, lodging in the Valley of <hi>Frael,</hi> was deſigning to fall upon <hi>Rohan</hi>'s Camp, which was diminiſhed with ſickneſs and Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways; but the Duke taking courage and counſel from neceſſity and danger, though exceeding much inferiour in Forces, faces at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares the <hi>Germans</hi> upon certain Hillocks, and <hi>Monſieur de Caniſii</hi> threatning to aſſault them from an eminent ſituation in the Rear, they took ſo great a fright, that they retired in diſorder under the favour of a Fort not far off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Serbellone,</hi> that knew nothing of what was happened on the other ſide, advanced as far as <hi>Morbegno</hi> with ſeven thouſand Foot, ſeven Companies of Horſe, and five Cannons, intrenching himſelf amidſt certain incloſures of Walls, which are frequent thereabout. But it was not long, ere <hi>Rohan,</hi> leaving <hi>Monſieur de la Lande,</hi> arrives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for towards <hi>Bormio,</hi> but with his men ſo weary with ſo much travelling to and fro, that it was hazardous to expoſe them to a fight. But not being willing to give the Enemy time to be informed of the weakneſs of his, nor to his to examine the ſtrength of the Enemy, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances couragiouſly to attacque them. At the beginning the <hi>French</hi> Horſe were ſtaggering, nay began to run, when the Duke reproaching ſome, and giving courage to others, puts himſelf at the head of them, charging with ſuch fury, that the Troops of <hi>Serbellone,</hi> after a ſhort reſiſtance, quitted the field. The number of the dead ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not ſix hundred, nor were the Priſoners many; becauſe the greater part ſaved themſelves betimes. Amongſt theſe was found the Count <hi>de Valenza,</hi> with other Officers, and amongſt the dead the Count <hi>de San Secondo,</hi> who commanded the Horſe. Of the hurt, the chiefeſt was <hi>Serbellone.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> being gone, the <hi>Germans</hi> alſo, thinking themſelves not ſufficiently ſafe in the Valley of <hi>Frael,</hi> removed further off, leaving <hi>Rohan</hi> the Glory and quiet poſſeſſion of the <hi>Valteline</hi> for the reſt of the Winter. Nevertheleſs he wanted not enemies from within, and they more troubleſom; for no ſuccours coming out of <hi>France,</hi> he found himſelf greatly weakned, and underwent neceſſity and many wants, ſo much the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:53750:212"/>
greater, for that the Plague gotten out of <hi>Tirol</hi> into the <hi>Valteline,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> had forbidden Commerce; ſo that the paſſage of Victuals, if not hindred, was at leaſt rendred difficult by reaſon of the uſual cautions.</p>
               <p>War being kindled in ſo many parts, the curioſity and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World did in a manner weary it ſelf in obſerving the ſucceſſes, the reflection upon one emergency coming frequently to be interrupted by another more remarkable. The Fleet of <hi>Spain,</hi> now put to Sea, recompenſing with its ſtrength the delays of the year paſt, conſiſted of thirty five Gallies, many great Ships, and other leſſer Veſſels, with ſeven thouſand Souldiers, commanded by the Duke of <hi>Ferandina</hi> and the Marqueſs of <hi>Santa Croce.</hi> Being under ſail, it no ſooner came near to the Coaſt of <hi>Provence,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced back by a furious ſtorm, it took harbour at <hi>Capo Corſo,</hi> after having loſt ſeven Gallies, and the reſt been much ſhattered, whereof many, to ſave themſelves, flung into the Sea Artillery, Horſes, and other Proviſions. Some of the Ships ran over to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Longone</hi> to repair themſelves, but all required much time. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, put into order again, and at laſt arriving at the Iſlands of <hi>Eres,</hi> which are called St. <hi>Honorat</hi> and St. <hi>Margaret,</hi> it happily ſucceeded in the taking of them, and for the preſervation of them preſently raiſed certain Forts there. The enterpriſe was judged to be of great importance; becauſe the Iſlands being near to the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, lye equally commodious to moleſt <hi>France</hi> and the County of <hi>Nizza.</hi> At <hi>Paris</hi> therefore they ſhewed great reſentment for it; but for the preſent giving the beſt order for Sea-affairs, time did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, <hi>Richelieu</hi> reſolves to defer the remedy, becauſe a ſtorm from <hi>Germany</hi> preſſed him more, if by re-inforcing the <hi>Swedes,</hi> he had not effected the hindring of it.</p>
               <p>The Peace concluded by the Elector of <hi>Saxe</hi> with the <hi>Emperour,</hi> in conſequence of the Victory obtained by the <hi>Austrians</hi> at <hi>Nord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghen,</hi> gave occaſion for great apprehenſions, becauſe the Elector had capitulated, not only for himſelf, but like an Arbitrator for all the Proteſtants: <hi>That Religion and Eccleſiaſtical Goods ſhould remain in the ſame ſtate, in which they were found to be in the year</hi> 1627; <hi>and thoſe, for the reſtoration whereof the Edict of</hi> Ferdinand <hi>was publiſhed, were to be enjoyed by the Proteſtants for forty years more. To</hi> Auguſtus <hi>his Son ſhould be left the Archbiſhoprick of</hi> Magdenburg, <hi>and to the Archduke</hi> Leopold, Halverſtadt, <hi>with an univerſal Amneſty, which ſhould only exclude the cauſes of the</hi> Palatinate <hi>and</hi> Bohemia. <hi>To</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia <hi>ſhould be continued the Electoral Vote and the Country, and if they would be comprehended in the Peace, the Dukedom of</hi> Mechelburg, Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenbutel, <hi>and</hi> Haumburg, <hi>ſhould be reſtored to their firſt Owners; and to</hi> Brandenburg <hi>the Inveſtiture of</hi> Pomerania <hi>ſhould be granted. The place of</hi> Philipſburg <hi>was to remain in the hand of the Emperour; and the Strangers, or thoſe of the</hi> Germans, <hi>that would not acquieſce in this Treaty, were to be proſecuted with united Forces as common Enemies; for which end in many Articles were concerted the conjunction of Armies, the Command of them, Contributions, and Quarters.</hi>

                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:53750:213"/>Although the Proteſtants univerſally complained, that <hi>Saxe,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſting his own affairs, and re-aſſuming his old inclination to the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrians,</hi> arrogated to himſelf the diſpoſing of the affairs of the Empire; nevertheleſs he, accuſing the neceſſity of things and times, which permitted not wonted forms, drew by his example the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> with many of the free Cities, and eſpecially <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm, Francfort</hi> upon <hi>Maine,</hi> and <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> to accept the Peace. After this, ſending his Army againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> he offers <hi>Bannier,</hi> who commanded them, a million and two hundred thouſand Dollers, if without expecting Force, he would be gone out of <hi>Germany;</hi> but he, interpoſing excuſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, found himſelf purſued and ſhut up in <hi>Pomerania.

On the other ſide, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts paſſing the <hi>Rhine</hi> with a great Party under <hi>Jean de Werth,</hi> made an Incurſion into the Borders of <hi>France,</hi> while in the mean time, <hi>Carlo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to whom they had aſſigned the body of an Army, poſſeſſed many places in <hi>Alſace,</hi> and <hi>Gallas</hi> with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Conqueſts along the <hi>Rhine</hi> and in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Frankendale, Guſtaveburg, Spire, Worms,</hi> and other places. <hi>Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delberg</hi> had not run a differing Fortune, if, while the Caſtle reſiſted, <hi>Gallas</hi> had not thought progreſs elſewhere more profitable. <hi>Mentz</hi> was preſerved, becauſe <hi>France,</hi> ſeeing ſo great a ſtorm at hand, ſent to joyn with <hi>Weimar</hi> an entire Army under the Cardinal <hi>de la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette,</hi> who putting on Arms above his Purple, appeared among the Armies and the <hi>Lutherans.

Such a Retreat differed not much from a Rout; ſo many were of the men loſt by the way through wearineſs and the want of Victuals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Richelieu</hi> was afflicted at theſe accidents, and becauſe Author of the War, he was himſelf eſteemed in a manner guilty of the ſucceſs. Nevertheleſs ſetting Art and his Wits more ſtrongly to work, and binding himſelf more cloſely to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> he perſwades <hi>Oxenſtern</hi> to come to confer with him at <hi>Compeigne.</hi> Where, contrary to that which commonly reſults from ſuch Conferences, both confeſſed the interview had reciprocally increaſed confidence, and added weight unto Fame. Having like inclinations, parts, and intereſts, they eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree upon the continuance of the War, of which having the ſame ends, they had alſo the ſame cauſes. They therefore agree upon a Treaty to confirm the old, binding themſelves by new obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, <hi>Not to make a ſeparate Peace, and to make uſe of all their
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:53750:213"/>
Force not to render any thing of that whereof they were now in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Weimar</hi> was ſometimes wavering, great advantages being offered him by the <hi>Auſtrians;</hi> but <hi>France</hi> confirmed him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſing to him a great ſum of money for the maintaining an Army of twelve thouſand Foot, ſix thouſand Horſe, and Artillery ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which he was to imploy in their Service. <hi>Alſace</hi> was left to him in prey, and <hi>Haghenau</hi> by <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, which was poſſeſſed of it, was delivered to him, with a ſpecial promiſe not to make Peace but by a common agreement, and without which that Province ſhould remain to the Duke. With this ballance of Arms <hi>France</hi> hindred, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſhould not be beaten out of the field, though alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy overcome, nor the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> enjoy the advantages of Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. But if by the foreſaid accords the means were ſetled for War, thoſe of Peace remained much more difficult. To propoſe and manage it, it may truly be ſaid, that there appeared no party in Chriſtendom undefiled with Faction, but the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> and therefore the parties turned their eyes and minds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, ſolliciting them, both with open endeavours and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intreaties, to undertake the Mediation of ſo dangerous a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pope,</hi> who for the affairs of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had the years paſt ſent <hi>Giulio Mazzarini,</hi> his Nuntio Extraordinary, to <hi>Paris,</hi> by his means in that Court, and by his ordinary Miniſters in the others, exhorted all with his powerful intreaties to Peace; and the <hi>Republick,</hi> by its offices and equal inſtances preſſed it, extending them alſo to the Princes of different Religion, whether thoſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> could not come, and particularly to the <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Holland.</hi> To <hi>Oxenſtern,</hi> who ſent to <hi>Venice</hi> the Count <hi>Galeazzo Gualdo,</hi> Prior of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> to communicate the ſtraights in which the party was, and to deſire aſſiſtance, the Senate gravely offered remonſtances of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Giovanni Craft,</hi> Counſellor of the Court, paſſing at this time in the Name of the Emperour to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> enemies to <hi>Spain,</hi> to perſwade them to Peace, exhorted alſo the <hi>Republick</hi> to cooperate in ſo great a good, and had for anſwer preciſe expreſſions of the deſire ſhe had of Peace, and the imployment, which with all her power ſhe contributed to the Mediation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ferdinand</hi> truly deſired Peace in proportion as it cloſed with his intereſt; for, affairs being in a better condition, he hoped to make, without diſadvantage, and to tranſmit to his Son the Succeſſion more quiet and ſecure. And for that cauſe he was not againſt the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of Arms, which the <hi>Pope</hi> propoſed betwixt <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Auſtrians;</hi> but the Favourites of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> having reduced their private grudges into publick conteſts, reciprocally believed the Treaty not ſincere, and the Peace not ſecure. Nevertheleſs at the requeſt and example of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> who publiſhes the Cardinal <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netti</hi> his Legate <hi>à Latere,</hi> Plenipotentiaries were named by the Princes to treat of an Accord, and by ſo much the more willingly by <hi>Richelieu,</hi> as that, ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> themſelves apt to blame the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſperous
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53750:214"/>
events of their Arms, he thereby obtains a ſuſpenſion of the peoples cenſure, by impreſſing upon them the hopes of Treaties for a Peace. But while the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſtudied to reconcile the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſcords of Chriſtendom, their own differences with the <hi>Pope</hi> increaſed. The buſineſs concerning the Conſul of <hi>Ancona,</hi> rightly underſtood by the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, was at laſt compoſed, and <hi>Oberti</hi> thereupon admitted to the Charge, and a while after leave was granted him by the Senate to withdraw himſelf for a time out of the City.</p>
               <p>After this, Meetings being renewed, the Negotiation about the Confines was taken in hand again, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour <hi>Monſieur de la Thuillerie</hi> treating about it in <hi>Venice,</hi> with the two formerly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, <hi>Nani</hi> and <hi>Soranzo,</hi> propoſing to draw a Line, which, always terminating upon the Land, left no other difficulty but to adjuſt, that the Chanels of the <hi>Po,</hi> changing their courſe, and paſſing the Line, if that of the <hi>Donzella</hi> ſhould paſs to the other, it ſhould be underſtood to belong to the Dominion Eccleſiaſtick, and contrariwiſe, that of the <hi>Goro</hi> coming to this ſide, it ſhould belong to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> But the <hi>Popes</hi> Miniſters, after having in the courſe of the Negotiation ſeveral times changed their minds in the cloſing with the foreſaid Propoſition, pretended, that <hi>Portoviro</hi> ſhould remain on their ſide. This is but the remaining ſign of a narrow Chanel, or rather a mooriſh Ditch; but becauſe it bore a good deal within the Line, and was a place of the unqueſtionable Juriſdiction of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they would not joyn their conſent to the liking of the <hi>French,</hi> who ſhewed themſelves, by reaſon of the novelty of the pretenſion, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the <hi>Pontificians.</hi> But this and all other Negotiation was broken off with <hi>Rome,</hi> by a more important occaſion happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the end of this year; for the Ambaſſadour <hi>Luigi Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarini</hi> was ſcarce gone out of the City, having had leave of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to go to certain Baths in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and thence home, leaving, till a Succeſſor ſhould arrive, <hi>Franceſco Maria Roſſi,</hi> his Secretary, at the Court, but there appeared in the Royal Hall (this is the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles Room in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> where the Ambaſſages of Kings, which are termed of <hi>Obedience,</hi> are received by the Pope) an alteration of the <hi>Elogium,</hi> which commemorated the Merit gained by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick in the defence of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third againſt <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drick Barbaroſſa</hi> the Emperour, almoſt five Ages agone happily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by Arms, and conſtrained to a Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf was amazed at ſuch a novelty, becauſe the Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by which were explained the Pictures in the Hall of the moſt memorable actions of Chriſtendom, had been made choice of in the time of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, by a Conſultation of Cardinals and other Learned perſons, and that in particular had been extracted by <hi>Alexander</hi> out of the moſt ancient proofs, the conſent of Authors, Inſcriptions, Pictures, Marbles, and out of authentick and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Memorials, and though in theſe late times called into doubt by Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> yet the credit of the Hiſtory remained, and out of it redounded praiſe to the Republick, and to the Church renown.

But the Senate preſently commanded <hi>Roſſi,</hi> that he ſhould come away without taking leave of the <hi>Pope</hi> or of the Court; and the Colledge, that they ſhould deny Audience to the <hi>Nuntio,</hi> and communicating to Princes the real reſentment of what had happened, declare, that no other courſe or expedient could ever ſatisfie it, but the entire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the ancient <hi>Elogium.</hi>

               <p>In the beginning of this year happened in <hi>Venice</hi> a thing, almoſt not to be ſpoken of, if it had not been toſſed up and down variouſly in diſcourſes, more perhaps than it deſerved. The long habit of the <hi>Patricians,</hi> by cuſtom of immemorial time, retains the reverence and gravity of the ancient <hi>Togati;</hi> and in Magiſtrates of Eminency was diſtinguiſhed, as to Authority and Reſpect, by the colour and largeneſs, whereupon ſuch a Garment was called <hi>Ducale,</hi> or more vulgarly with <hi>Large Sleeves.</hi> Thoſe that came out of the Charge of Counſellors, or of the <hi>Savii</hi> of the Council, which among thoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the City and Policy, have the chiefeſt ranks, and who in Ambaſſages to Kings had done Service to the Country, bringing back the degree of Knighthood, continued to uſe the ſame form of Garment, but black, during their lives. When this cuſtom had its beginning, is not known, or whether there was a Law for it, oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by time, or that time had given it the authority of a Law. The number now ſeemed ſomewhat enlarged, whilſt a certain vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous deſire to render themſelves diſtinguiſhed from the common, provoked many to ſollicite the chief Imployments of the City, and to merit them, animated to undertake thoſe abroad, that were more
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53750:215"/>
difficult and burdenſom. Some began with whiſpers, afterwards with more open diſcourſes in Companies and the idle Market-place, to blame the cuſtom and the diſtinction not authorized by a Law, nay rather to accuſe it, as an ambitious invention of thoſe, who not being able through the wiſe Inſtitutions of the Republick to continue in the Magiſtracy, had yet a mind for oſtentation to bear the Badges of it. They ſaid, <hi>That in theſe Garments was not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted that moderation of a private life, in which the interchangeable courſe of command regulates the equality of the Citizens. Whence was that Law, which in the Republick, if liberty exempts from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Strangers, moderates and reſtrains the pride and avarice of private men? Can poſſibly Honours be wanting to Citizens, or can Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens be wanting for Honours, where, in the quality of Birth, they all enjoy the ornament of liberty united to the dignity of command? Their ſervice being as a debt, which is lent to the Country, ought to paſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reward, and if the imployments be ſhort, to the end that the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of them may be modeſt, why ſhould a perpetual diſtinction be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red? That in the moderate minds of the Citizens were more firmly grounded the Ornaments of Dignity, the Monuments of Glory, the Badges, and the Praiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others diſſented from that opinion, believing that with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Garments was intended the taking away the degrees and difference, not only from Perſons, but from Merit, in ſuch ſort, that actions and perſons ſhould undiſtinguiſhedly be confounded. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs by <hi>Anthony Veniero</hi> and <hi>Andrea Moroſini,</hi> Counſellors, <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni Baptiſta Foſcarini</hi> and <hi>Giovanni Cernovicchio, Capi de Quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> was propoſed to the great Council a Decree, that laying aſide the <hi>Ducals</hi> by thoſe that wore them, and not continuing them for the future, when out of Office, they ſhould only be reſerved to the <hi>Procurators</hi> of St. <hi>Marco,</hi> the Eldeſt Son or Brother of the Dukes, and to the Great Chancellor, to whom they were already permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Laws. To Knights, in honour of the degree, it was granted, that under the Veſt ſhould be worn Garments of red, and the Welt of the Robe, with the Ornaments of the Girdle, gilt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the inclination of the major number it was embraced, though the Duke, and <hi>Franceſco Baſadonna, Giovanni Pizani, Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico Ruzzini,</hi> Counſellors, together with <hi>Franceſco Barbarigo, Capo de Quaranta,</hi> propoſed, that this very ancient cuſtom ſhould not be aboliſhed, but rather reformed, yielding that Veſt in future to him, that ſhould have twice undergone the Charge of Counſellor, or four times that of <hi>Savio</hi> of the Council; reckoning alſo within that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Embaſſies and Governments. Immediately with a notable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Punctuality was ſeen the day following the Habits laid aſide, ſome remaining, from age, their grey hairs, and their merit, taken notice of by the people, much more adorned and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than they were before by the Garment. A while after an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was made by <hi>Girolamo Triviſano, Girolamo Peſaro,</hi> and <hi>Marino Bragadino, Avogadori</hi> of the Commons, to ſuſpend the reſolution, to the end it might be propoſed anew with ſome kind of reformation;
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:53750:215"/>
but it being confirmed, no more was ſaid of it, which ſignified, that in the debates of buſineſſes the Underſtanding is in the Citizens, the Father of divers opinions; but, after Decrees paſt, the Will is in all equally, the Mother of obedience.</p>
               <p>Re-aſſuming now the diſcourſe of the War betwixt the Crowns; Forces not inferiour to the hatreds were in preparation; nor had advantages ſerved on the one ſide to pacifie them, or loſſes on the other to ſuppreſs them; but from ancient experiences and new ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, the Forces ſeeming rather equally poiſed, the emulation of minds was ſo much the more inflamed. In <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Winter were very ſtrong, both by the arrival of new ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, and becauſe the paſſages for <hi>Germany</hi> and for <hi>Flanders</hi> being ſhut before them, they were forced to entertain the Army in that Province. On the other ſide the <hi>French,</hi> partly conſumed before <hi>Valenza,</hi> and partly by natural impatience diſbanded, appeared to be greatly weakned. Nevertheleſs there wanted not ſeveral Factions of War. The Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> lodged with the Troops which ſerved for Convoy to thoſe of Duke <hi>Edward</hi> in the <hi>Piacentino,</hi> and had order to made an Inroad into the <hi>Modoneſe,</hi> to revenge the adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of that Duke, and the ſending of Souldiers to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To have a pretext for it, he deſires quarters might be given to a part of his Troops, and that being denied him, he falls of a ſudden into the Territory of <hi>Modena</hi> with a thouſand Foot and as many Horſe, plundering <hi>Caſtelnuovo</hi> and other places, and carrying away the Booty. The Duke, from the flames and flight of the Peaſants informed of the aſſault, was greatly ſurpriſed, becauſe the miſchief was done him by the Troops of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> his Uncle, and he was obliged to revenge himſelf upon him of <hi>Parma,</hi> his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Kinſman, and till now Confident. He and his Country were taken unprovided of men, and if he invited the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he knew the ſuccours would coſt him dear. Having recourſe to the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> he found, that if amidſt the diſcords of Strangers they kept themſelves neuter, they would much leſs take other part amongſt the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> than to perſwade and ſollicite Peace; ſo that he was forced to addreſs himſelf to <hi>Leganes,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan;</hi> and he, readily embracing the invitations, ſends him two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and eight hundred Horſe with his beſt Commanders, which were <hi>Vincenzo Gonzagha,</hi> the Baron <hi>de Batteville,</hi> and the Count <hi>Areſe.</hi> To theſe joyning between three and four thouſand men tumultuarily got together of the Country-Militia, under the Prince <hi>Luigi</hi> his Uncle, who by leave of the <hi>Venetians</hi> was come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Country, he ſends them into that of <hi>Parma,</hi> whither <hi>Villa</hi> was withdrawn, who aſſaulting them with great bravery in their march towards <hi>Parma,</hi> forced them to a Retreat, <hi>Gonzagha</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Officers being hurt. Nevertheleſs <hi>Roſſena,</hi> which is a little Diſtrict beyond the River <hi>Lenza,</hi> belonging to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> remained in the hands of the <hi>Modeneſe,</hi> in recompence of the damages, or rather for a fair pretext for a Treaty. In effect, the Dukes, <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> had little inclination to break into
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:53750:216"/>
War betwixt themſelves and the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> letting paſs this reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as in complacence to the <hi>French,</hi> cared not it ſhould go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; whereupon Monſieur <hi>Mellino,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Smola,</hi> being ſent by the <hi>Pope</hi> to ſollicite an adjuſtment, though for that time, in regard of the intereſts of the Crowns who deſired, to have their parts in it, he obtained it not; yet he effected, that animoſities ſhould be laid aſide, and hoſtilities tacitly ſuſpended. But the Territories of <hi>Parma</hi> were more ſeverely afflicted; for that to free the <hi>Modeneſe</hi> from harms, or rather to puniſh that Duke for the hoſtility undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly attempted, and to bring him alſo to a Peace by force; <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes</hi> ſent between four and five thouſand men, with <hi>Carlo della Gatta,</hi> into the <hi>Piacentino,</hi> who poſſeſſed the Caſtle St. <hi>Giovanni, Rottofre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and ſome Villages, diſperſing the Troops every where to plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and burn the Country with as much miſchief as could be.

                  <hi>Edward</hi> was ſtill at <hi>Paris;</hi> ſo that upon ſo many Invaſions, the Dutcheſs his Wife, who governed in his abſence, being in diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, fearing <hi>Gabioneda,</hi> requeſts the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> to ſend a ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thither, poſſibly believing, that making uſe for that purpoſe of the Troops of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they might intereſt themſelves in the maintenance of that place, which gave jealouſie to ſo many. But the Senate not conſenting that they ſhould elſewhere be diſpoſed of but for the Garriſon of <hi>Mantua;</hi> Monſieur <hi>de la Tour,</hi> who for <hi>France</hi> remained with the Duke in quality of General of his Troops, perſwades him to ſend thither two hundred Foot of his own, which were of the Garriſon of <hi>Porto.</hi> But they were no ſooner brought into it, but they were ſent back to <hi>Mantua,</hi> either becauſe there was no need of ſo ſlender ſuccours, or becauſe thoſe of <hi>Parma</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it better in all events, that <hi>Sabioneda</hi> ſhould depend upon themſelves, without bringing into it the Troops of a Neighbour, who pretended right to it, and had intereſt for it.</p>
               <p>The lamentable condition of the Country of <hi>Parma</hi> being come into <hi>France,</hi> the Duke parts Poſt, loaded with hopes; but being come into <hi>Italy,</hi> found that he had brought from Court more liberal promiſes than he could receive ready ſuccours. He paſſionately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, with the <hi>French</hi> Troops and <hi>Savoyards</hi> joining, to aſſault the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> and, opening the way with his Sword, revenge at once the damage done his Country. <hi>Crequi</hi> excuſes himſelf upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pretexts, ſometimes alledging the ſcanty number of men, and then ſhewing an unſuperable intrenchment, which, to diſpute the paſſage, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had raiſed, and well fortified along the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via.</hi> He promiſes nevertheleſs to aſſiſt him by diverſions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke, to defend his own, was forced, <hi>incognito</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied but with few, by the River of <hi>Genua</hi> and by <hi>Lunigiana,</hi> to get into his own Country, where he was received by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with great applauſe.</p>
               <p>Moſt effectual Orders were ſurely ſent from <hi>France,</hi> not to let
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:53750:216"/>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> be brought to deſpair, or his Country be loſt. The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> to make a diverſion, was the firſt that advanced towards the <hi>Lago di Como,</hi> where, taking <hi>la Toretta,</hi> which is near the Fort <hi>Fuentes,</hi> and afterwards the Town of <hi>Golico,</hi> made that Fort uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to the great trouble of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, and terrour to the Country. But the Duke could not long remain there, having not only want of means to advance and ſubſiſt, but doubting, leſt, if he went too far off, the <hi>Germans</hi> ſhould come through <hi>Tirol</hi> into the <hi>Valteline,</hi> where the people, though he had declared by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Edict, that other Religion than the Catholick ſhould not be practiſed, hated the Nation and the General, being many ways vexed by the inſolency of the Souldiery. So that contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have plundred <hi>le Pievi</hi> and other Towns <hi>di Valſaſna,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires. He had demanded of the <hi>Venetians</hi> paſſage, that through a Friends Country to rights and with more ſpeed he might go to the ſuccours of <hi>Parma,</hi> not that in truth he did believe he ſhould obtain it, but that by the negative the Crown might better juſtifie it ſelf to the Duke. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> alſo, to oppoſe him, asked the ſame for the <hi>Germans</hi> which were to come out of <hi>Tirol</hi> into the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laneſe.</hi> But the Senate, to one and t' other, refuſe it, on the juſt pretext of the Plague, which no leſs aflicted <hi>Tirol</hi> than the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rohan</hi> being not yet retired, <hi>Crequi,</hi> to ſtrengthen the diverſion, enters into the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> on the other ſide, having, beſides ſome Troops come to him out of <hi>France,</hi> perſwaded the Duke <hi>Victorio</hi> to join Forces; ſo that the Army conſiſted of ten or twelve thouſand Foot, and betwixt two or three thouſand Horſe. <hi>Vigevano</hi> was threatned, and being furniſhed but with a ſlender defence, the taking of it was judged eaſie, to the ſo great terrour of the whole Country, that in the City of <hi>Milan</hi> fear at laſt was turned into tumult. <hi>Leganes</hi> was therefore conſtrained to haſten thither with all his Forces, calling back thoſe which made ſpoil in the <hi>Piacentino,</hi> and leaving <hi>Sorbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi> a few Troops, that intrenching himſelf at <hi>Mus,</hi> he might make head the beſt he could againſt <hi>Rohan,</hi> and, if need required, ſuccour the Fort <hi>Fuentes</hi> by the <hi>Lago de Como:</hi> He then encamps at <hi>Abbia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſſo</hi> to cover the innermoſt parts of the State, and keep off hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from that fruitful and delicious Country. The Territories of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> by this means taking breath, the Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> had not much to do to recover <hi>Caſtel St. Giovanni,</hi> and plundring ſome Villages of the Country of <hi>Pavia</hi> to join without oppoſition the Army of the Confederates.</p>
               <p>They, in the opportunity of undertaking many things, ſtood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved and in ſuſpence, what in particular was fit to be underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; nor did the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Crequi</hi> agree. Whereupon quitting the thought of <hi>Vigevano,</hi> and threatning in ſeveral parts, they ingaged in none. At laſt with changing quarters and running to and fro, having for ſome Weeks ſpoiled the <hi>Lomellina,</hi> they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into the <hi>Novareſe,</hi> and took <hi>Fontanetto</hi> a place of little note, but ſhall for the future remain famous by the death of <hi>Thoiras,</hi> who
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:53750:217"/>
playing the Volunteer with <hi>Vittorio,</hi> ſhot with a Muſket, dyed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on the place. Thence they paſſed to <hi>Olleggio,</hi> in deſign to ſeize upon <hi>Arona,</hi> a Caſtle upon the <hi>Lago majore,</hi> by the poſſeſſion whereof paſſage was not only opened to rich and well-peopled Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which might ſerve for convenient Winter-quarters; but was ſhut to Succours and Levies, which were to come out of <hi>Germany</hi> by that way which alone remained open to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> And in this alſo proceeding ſlowly, the Counts <hi>Borromei,</hi> to whom the Fief belongs, had time to fortifie it, and with Garriſons to ſtrengthen the narrow paths of thoſe Mountains. But in truth, a more notable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion allured the <hi>French</hi> to hopes of better ſucceſſes by paſſing the <hi>Teſino,</hi> always believed a ſtrong and almoſt invincible Rampart of the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi> That River falling from the <hi>Alps,</hi> and paſſing through <hi>il Lago maggiore,</hi> for a little ſpace ſtraightned by Rocks, runs impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly amongſt the ſtones; thence falling into a Plain, waters a fruitful Campagnia, and bearing Boats, ſerves commodiouſly for the uſe of that Country, ſo long, till with a large Chanel and a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Stream, it diſcharges it ſelf into the <hi>Po.</hi> Where the Plain begins, the Confederates ſeeing all defence abandoned, and far off, caſting over a Bridge of Boats, brought thither upon Carts, paſs it. At <hi>Tornavento,</hi> which is no other than a Country-houſe, the Quarter was planted, and certain Ditches caſt up in ancient times, called <hi>Pan Perduto,</hi> ſerved for Trenches. They diverted immediately the <hi>Navillio,</hi> which is a Chanel, that for the convenience of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce conveys part of the water of the <hi>Teſino</hi> to <hi>Milan,</hi> to the ſo great confuſion of that City, that imagining the Enemy at the Gates, as if there had been neither time nor eſcape, many fled haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the beſt of their Houſhold-ſtuff towards the Country of the <hi>Venetians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>Trivulſio</hi> getting on Horſe-back, with his Credit and Authority, which he had very great amongſt the Citizens, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up and down the ſtreets, animated ſome, ſtrengthned all, and diſtributing Arms to the Inhabitants, appointed Guards, and gave out Orders, reſtrained the fright, and in a great meaſure quieted the Tumult, which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, retiring themſelves, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather to irritate with their preſence. The City raged againſt <hi>Leganes,</hi> that with an Army ſo well appointed having not hindred that paſſage, careleſly amuſed himſelf in beholding the dangers and the damage; but, as it happens in ſuch emergencies, fear reigned every where more than counſel: for if in <hi>Milan</hi> they were aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Confederates were alſo perplexed, whilſt the number of their men was not proportionable to the deſign of beſieging that City, and their chief purpoſe was vaniſhed, which in truth was to joyn with <hi>Rohan,</hi> and with united Forces to advance, either before <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> or into the bowels of the Country to carry fear into it, and bring back ſome notable Conqueſt; but <hi>Rohan</hi> too ſoon, and <hi>Crequi</hi> too late being come into the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> the one being not able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt there, and the other not to make any progreſs, were the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of more noiſe than hurt. Beſides this, they wanted Victuals,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:53750:217"/>
and above all, the inclination of the <hi>Savoyards</hi> did not conſpire in the ſame ends. Nevertheleſs <hi>Leganes</hi> was exerciſed with many thoughts. To go nearer with the Army to <hi>Milan,</hi> he feared to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty famine and commotion thither; if he drew nearer to the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates to hazard a Battel, he conſidered in the uncertain iſſue the certain loſs of the whole State.</p>
               <p>At laſt after ſeveral days, perceiving by the Enemies not advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, that their thoughts were in diſorder, and their Forces not ſo ſtrong, perſwaded rather by univerſal reproaches than the opinion of his Counſellors, he reſolves to riſe from <hi>Abbiagraſſo,</hi> and advance towards the Enemy, without other deſign than to reap the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the occaſions. He found, that for conveniency of Forrage the <hi>Savoyards</hi> were returned to the other ſide of the River; whence he judged it ſeaſonable to ſet upon the <hi>French</hi> on this ſide. Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore a part of their Cavalry, which was roving without the Camp, and obliging them to retire, he afterwards attacques the Trenches and Forts. The fight was obſtinate and irkſom, in a long days work, and in the heat of <hi>June,</hi> to ſuch a degree, that after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours both Armies being weary, the <hi>French</hi> could no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, nor the <hi>Spaniards</hi> prevail. In the heat of the Battel, it ſeemed as if <hi>Leganes</hi> had had the better; but the Duke <hi>Vittorio,</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the <hi>Teſino,</hi> brought <hi>Crequi</hi> ſuccours ſo ſeaſonably, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune began to waver. But night ſeparated, and <hi>Leganes,</hi> not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a more convenient Quarter near, returns to <hi>Abbiagraſſo.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both the parties, about three thouſand men were killed, and of the <hi>Spaniards, Gerardo Gambacorta,</hi> General of the <hi>Neopolitan</hi> Horſe, a valiant and prudent Perſon. To determine who had the advantage in the fight, whilſt each aſcribed it to himſelf, it was fit to obſerve the conſequences; and becauſe in an Enemies Country it ſeems, that he that makes no progreſs is the perſon worſted, the advantage was at laſt adjudged to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> becauſe the <hi>French,</hi> though they ſtaid ſome days in their Quarters, yet at laſt repaſſed the <hi>Teſino.</hi> Their deſires thereby were, in proſecution of the ſame end, to open the way into the Vallies formerly mentioned, to poſſeſs <hi>Anghiera</hi> upon the <hi>Lago maggiore,</hi> or <hi>Romagna</hi> near to the <hi>Seſia;</hi> but neither ſucceeding, they thereupon retire, <hi>Crequi</hi> to <hi>Breme</hi> with a very few Forces, and <hi>Vittorio</hi> to <hi>Vercelli</hi> to defend his own Country. Diſcord between them brake forth more and more; the Duke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding the <hi>French</hi> with the ſervice of having ſaved them at <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navento,</hi> and <hi>Crequi</hi> aſcribing to the <hi>Savoyards</hi> the having miſſed oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions and ſucceſſes. But if the Duke felt the diſſatisfactions of the Confederates, <hi>Piedmont</hi> reſented the injuries of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for that <hi>Philippo di Silva,</hi> General of the Horſe, over-running the Country, recovered <hi>Annone,</hi> poſſeſſed by the Confederates when they firſt moved, and made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Gattinara,</hi> carrying ruine and deſolation where ever he came. He of <hi>Parma</hi> enjoying a ſhort ſuſpenſion of miſchiefs, aſſembling ſome of his own Troops, and ſome <hi>French</hi> being come to him by the River of <hi>Genoua,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to recover <hi>Rottofredo;</hi> but <hi>Martino d'Aragona</hi> coming upon
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:53750:218"/>
him with a greater Party, he was conſtrained to riſe. And appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending greater oppreſſions after the <hi>French</hi> ſhould be diſlodged from the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> he ſends to <hi>Paris</hi> Count <hi>Fabio Scoti,</hi> the moſt truſted of his Miniſters, to the end that as Author of the counſel to adhere to that Crown, he might alſo be the better inſtrument to obtain powerful ſuccours.</p>
               <p>But the affairs of that Kingdom were in ſo great turbulence, that there was but faint hope to obtain aſſiſtance; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Picardy,</hi> and <hi>Gallas,</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> ſpoiled the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Champaigne,</hi> the people miſerably ſuffering the puniſhments of faults, which were not their own. The <hi>French</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving renounced neutrality with the County of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that in <hi>Alſace</hi> that Province had afforded aſſiſtance to the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> had laid Siege to <hi>Dole;</hi> but after having reduced it to great extremities, by loſing much time with his great ſlackneſs, he fruſtrated the enjoyment of ſo near a Conqueſt; for <hi>Lamboy</hi> and <hi>Merci</hi> being come with power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Forces to its Succours under the Emperours Colours, whilſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army plaid the Conquerours in <hi>Picardy,</hi> obliged the King to recall him, and command him to raiſe the Siege. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> under Prince <hi>Thomaſo,</hi> and with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Piccolomini,</hi> ſent by the Emperour with a good number of men, had beſieged <hi>la Chapelle,</hi> forcing the Governour, the Baron <hi>de Beck,</hi> to give it up after eight days Battery. The <hi>Catelet</hi> followed the example, but with leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. They afterwards attacque <hi>Corby</hi> to aſſure the paſſage of the <hi>Somma,</hi> and whilſt the Siege laſted, <hi>Jean de Werdt</hi> and <hi>Piccolomini</hi> made a courſe as far as <hi>Pontoiſe</hi> with the Cavalry, burning and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering every where. The place being taken ſooner by much than it ought to have been, there was no other obſtacle betwixt that and <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Armies, though victorious, have always greater ſuſpicions and difficulties than are conceived by the conquered. Therefore applying themſelves to ranſack the Country, and to raiſe the crys of the people againſt the Author of the War and the evils thereof, they put <hi>Richelieu</hi> into a great ſtraight, but gave him time to ward the blow. He in the beginning was in great trouble, and knowing the City of <hi>Paris</hi> eaſie to be ſtirred, hard to be governed, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuſpicious to the King, and always troubleſom to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, had thoughts of carrying the King and Court to <hi>Orleans.</hi> But in Council being boldly in this extremity reproached by others, that if he had brought the Kingdom into danger, he ought not to leave it without remedy, taking heart, he applies himſelf to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. From the hatred againſt him proceeded in great part the preſent miſchiefs; for of the Governours of the places taken it was believed, that ſome of them had been corrupted before they were beſieged, and that others had haſtened the Surrender to burden with ignominy and infelicity the Director of the preſent Government. He therefore applies himſelf in his adverſity to other Arts, than thoſe which are uſually practiſed in the proſperity of Fortune. He takes
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:53750:218"/>
away the Gabels, puts Arms into the peoples hands, gives the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Armies to the Princes of the blood; that their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and credit might invite Souldiers, and keep them under the Colours, which, by reaſon of his Government, were abhorred. <hi>Soiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> was the firſt, who, having near to <hi>la Fera</hi> augmented in haſte the Army which he already commanded, attempted to oppoſe the incurſions of the Enemy; but they beating the Regiment of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> he was forced to retire to <hi>Noijon</hi> to defend the Country, till <hi>Orleans</hi> ſhould come into the Field with greater Forces. Under the Mareſhal <hi>de la Force,</hi> greatly beloved of the <hi>Pariſians,</hi> twenty thouſand of them took Arms, to haſte to prevent the miſchiefs, which <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Champaigne</hi> lay under.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gallas,</hi> after by burning and pillaging he had given vent to the natural cruelty of the <hi>Polonian</hi> Cavalry and the <hi>Croats,</hi> came with an Army of forty thouſand men to lodge at <hi>Fontaine Francoiſe,</hi> and, to fix his ſtation there by ſome conſiderable Conqueſt, endeavours to poſſeſs St. <hi>John de Loſne;</hi> but <hi>Richelieu</hi> calling <hi>Weimar</hi> and <hi>la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta</hi> out of <hi>Germany</hi> to ſuccour the Kingdom, ſent the Count of <hi>Ranzau</hi> ſo ſeaſonably into the place, that withſtanding the firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques of the Imperialiſts, it gave time to the <hi>French</hi> to ſtrengthen themſelves with ſo many Troops, that being equal to the Enemy, or rather more conſiderable, by reaſon of the knowledge and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the ſituation, obliged him, without the hazard of a Battel, to retire, loaden with pillage and much more with blame; ſpoil alone ſeeming a recompence diſproportionable to the occaſion, to fortune, and to ſo powerful an Army. Yet it is true, that <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> had juſt excuſes, though not then diſcovered, having ſecret Commiſſion from the Emperour to hazard nothing, and not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Army juſt at that time, when at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> the election of a <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> was ripening, to the end to make uſe of the countenance and power of the Army for incouragement of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, if need required.</p>
               <p>The Forces alſo in <hi>Picardy</hi> being wearied and weakned by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to and fro and plundring, the <hi>Infanta</hi> was not able to make any further progreſs, diſtracted alſo from the ſide of <hi>Holland;</hi> for that <hi>Orange,</hi> having after a long Siege regained <hi>Schink Schans</hi> upon conditions, was in complacency to the <hi>French</hi> in the Field, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning certain Forts, which not far from <hi>Antwerp</hi> lye alongſt the <hi>Scheld.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orleans</hi> therefore had the opportunity to recover <hi>Roye</hi> after ten days attacque, and thence laying the Siege before <hi>Corby</hi> in a ſhort time takes in the outworks. The King was at <hi>Amiens</hi> to incourage the enterpriſe, and afterwards came to the Camp, to be preſent at the ſurrender, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not hinder, though they threatned <hi>Dourlans,</hi> becauſe <hi>Soiſſons</hi> oppoſed them. Thus the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Kingdom and the Cardinal breathed again, in as much as alſo on the other ſide near the <hi>Pireneans,</hi> the <hi>Almirante</hi> of <hi>Caſtil</hi> having with a great Army beſieged <hi>Bayonne,</hi> the Count of <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> Governour of <hi>Bearn,</hi> had obliged him to raiſe it.

affairs notwithſtanding grew ſomewhat turbulent, many in <hi>Zaintonge</hi> and other Provinces riſing againſt the Impoſitions: So that eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand men were actually in Arms under the Marqueſs <hi>d'Iſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi> Brother to <hi>Charlois,</hi> whoſe head ſome years paſt <hi>Richelieu</hi> had cauſed to be cut off. Nevertheleſs one part of theſe Mutineers was quickly quieted, and the other ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>The diſcontents of the Princes that had commanded the Armies had yet a worſe appearance; becauſe the Campania was no ſooner at an end, but they were aware, that they had enjoyed employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not to advance them to command, but to keep them quiet, and that <hi>Richelieu</hi> had only made uſe of them during the ſtorm, leaving to others the pains and the dangers, and reaping to himſelf the reward and the credit. <hi>Orleans,</hi> who before he made an end of the Siege of <hi>Corby,</hi> perceived that he ſerved not in the Army but for a ſhadow, was gone to <hi>Blois,</hi> but coming after the giving of it up to the Court, to congratulate with the King, departs of a ſudden without ſeeing him, together with <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> both publiſhing to have certain advice, that a Priſon was to be their recompence.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal applies his Wits to reconcile in the firſt place the King to his Brother, who was not gone further than <hi>Blois;</hi> nor was it difficult for him to do it, under promiſe that the marriage with the Siſter of <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſhould be approved. The Count then weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſeparation from the other, received it for a favour, that he might for four years abide at <hi>Sedan,</hi> where he appeared to be. <hi>France</hi> now in this year, by new Treaties, cloſes more nearly with the <hi>Swedes,</hi> concluding one in <hi>Wiſmar,</hi> wherein all the former being confirmed, the War was diſtributed into the hereditary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the <hi>Auſtrians, Bohemia</hi> and the Provinces adjacent being allotted to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and to <hi>France</hi> thoſe that were neareſt the <hi>Rhine. William Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſen</hi> came into this Treaty, <hi>France</hi> agreeing to pay him a great Penſion, and two hundred thouſand Dollars for the ſubſiſtence of his Army. Whereupon he made no ſmall progreſs; for he not only obliged the Catholick Army, which beſieged <hi>Oſnaburg,</hi> to withdraw, but ſurpriſed <hi>Minden,</hi> and brought ſuccours ſeaſonably into <hi>Hanau,</hi> beſieged by <hi>Lamboy.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, theſe ballanced not the advantages of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who after a long Siege got <hi>Magdenburg,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Verben; Banier,</hi> who ſaw himſelf very much weakned, being obliged to go towards the Sea to receive a powerful renfort that was ſent him out of <hi>Swede.</hi>

Whereupon aroſe in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Peace a laſting difficulty; whilſt <hi>France,</hi> by reaſon of the excluſion of the Elector of <hi>Trier</hi> from the Diet, would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the new King of the <hi>Romans</hi> but for King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were other lets wanting, the confederate Crowns pretending (after the fears were over in <hi>France,</hi> during which <hi>Richelieu</hi> had ſhewed great propenſity to Peace, to becalm with the Treaty the fury of the Armies,) Paſs-ports for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants of the Empire their Confederates, and the Emperour and <hi>Spaniards</hi> denying them to theſe, as to Vaſſals, and to the others as to Rebels, and therefore uncapable to appear in the aſſembly in quality of Soveraigns.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding that difficult and tedious obſtacles were foreſeen, the Pope diſpatches to <hi>Colen,</hi> the City appointed for the conference, the Cardinal <hi>Ginetti</hi> his Legate, who paſſing through the Territory of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and being received with meet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, ſent to the Republick a Letter from <hi>

               <p>The diſtraction of the <hi>French,</hi> and their retreat out of the <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> had put the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> into very great ſtraits: for <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> ſends an Army upon his back under the command of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Trivultio,</hi> who, beſides publick reſpect, had particular motives of hatred againſt <hi>Edward.</hi> At the ſame time <hi>Martin d'Arragon</hi> roved with the Cavalry betwixt <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and taking St. <hi>Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino,</hi> a City which enjoys the dignity of a Biſhops See, waſted the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:53750:220"/>
Country called <hi>Pallavicino;</hi> for it formerly had been confiſcated from the Dukes of that Family, and <hi>Gille de Haes</hi> in another part had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Rivalta,</hi> though well fortified by force. The body of the Army attacqued <hi>Puiglio</hi> upon the <hi>Lenza,</hi> and finding reſiſtance, would not ſtop there, but carried the ſeat of the War and the force of their Arms to the Siege of <hi>Piacenza.</hi> The Duke ſhutting himſelf up there, and providing the Citadel, had therein alone placed the hopes of defence; but after ſome little conteſt in the very beginning of the Siege, loſt, together with certain Mills, the Iſland, which the <hi>Po</hi> formed over againſt the City, and which, beſides the offence it gave the Town it ſelf by Batteries, hindred the Navigation upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The Duke now began to perceive, that he had been more greedy to undertake a War than able to defend himſelf. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs was not wanting to ſollicite for ſuccours in ſeveral Courts. The Pope, Soveraign of the Country, exceeded not mediation and Offices for Peace by the means of Count <hi>Ambrogio Carpegna,</hi> who by very ſecret and private Commiſſion from the <hi>Barberins</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed offers to <hi>Edward</hi> of ſecret Subſidies of Money, provided he would yield to their Houſe certain Towns belonging to the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Caſtro.</hi> The great Duke alſo ſends to <hi>Piacenza Dominico Pandolfino,</hi> that he might interpoſe in the adjuſtment, and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the Duke to it by neceſſity, poſitively denied him all aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>Nor would the <hi>Venetians</hi> alter their neutrality, judging, that whilſt the Pope, as Soveraign, the great Duke as Kinſman, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoyards</hi> as Confederates, did not lend him their hand, there was no more effectual argument for them not to out-run the others. And the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with many flatteries aſſured them, that as the Incurſions into the Dukes Countries were only reſentments of the damages done by him to the <hi>Mileneſe,</hi> ſo if the Fortune of the War ſhould make any conqueſt, it ſhould either be reſtored or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited, as a generous teſtimony of that moderation, with which it was to be underſtood their King exerciſed revenge againſt an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Prince. And in effect, they ſtraightened the place but ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, rather to bring the Duke to an agreement, than to take it, as well knowing into what diſorder in that caſe, by reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of the Church, they ſhould put themſelves, and what jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies would thereupon be raiſed in the minds of the Princes of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Duke alſo falling very ſick, inclined at laſt to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, not ſeeing ſuccours any where in a readineſs; for although the Fleet of <hi>France,</hi> now at Sea, appeared with ſome number of Ships in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> making as if it would attempt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbark, and thruſt in ſuccours to him; yet the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> with Forces equal diſputed it, and <hi>Leganes</hi> by Land had ſo fortified the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that it would be difficult, and a work of time to force them. In the beginning then of the year, excluding <hi>Carpegna</hi> from the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as little acceptable to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by reaſon of his inclinations to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> and not more to the Duke, by reaſon of the projects of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> the agreement was by <hi>Melo</hi> and <hi>Pandolfino</hi> concluded,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:53750:220"/>
and almoſt at the ſame inſtant approved and executed by both the parties; for deſiring not to be diſcovered in the Negotiation, they equally endeavoured expedition and ſecrecy; the one, that the <hi>French,</hi> who had their Garriſon both in <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> might not give them any diſturbance; and the other, becauſe <hi>Sabioneda</hi> being by the Duke to be put into the power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> they doubted leſt the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> ſhould take jealouſie, and in his regard the <hi>Venetians</hi> reſent it. From the effect only and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was argued the ſubſtance of the Conditions.</p>
               <p>The Garriſon of the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Piacenza</hi> was ſufficiently ſtrong, and in a condition, if it had been aware of the Treaty, to have croſſed it, and to have reſiſted, if they had attempted to turn them out by force. The Duke therefore, obliged not only to make uſe of ſecrecy, but of care, calling together the Souldiers, with <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Paulo</hi> who commanded them, into a place apart, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of giving them a months pay, and there turning the Cannon againſt them, excuſing in a few words the neceſſity of the agreement, with courteous expreſſions gave them their diſcharge. To thoſe that were in <hi>Piacenza,</hi> paſſage was permitted through the <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> towards <hi>Piedmont;</hi> the others that were in <hi>Parma,</hi> retired to <hi>Viadana</hi> in the <hi>Mantuan,</hi> and from thence through the State of the <hi>Venetians</hi> paſſed by ſmall parties into the <hi>Valteline.</hi> And now the Duke was reſtored by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> into thoſe Territories taken by them, and into Goods, which at the beginning of the War he poſſeſſed in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and had been confiſcate. With the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> miſunderſtandings ceaſed, <hi>Roſſena</hi> being ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred back to <hi>Edward.</hi> He on the other ſide gives up <hi>Sabioneda</hi> as the price of the Peace and the Reſtitutions, withdrawing his Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out of it, and receiving an hundred thouſand Crowns of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Milan,</hi> under the notion of repairing his expences. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berio Brancaccio</hi> was hereupon obſerved to enter into it with <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> Foot, it being given out, to take away from the envy of the fact, that by the Teſtament of the old Princeſs of <hi>Stigliana,</hi> who at this time dyed, he was named Governour; whereupon he had levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe Souldiers for the cuſtody of it, till amidſt many Pretenders the cauſe ſhould be decided by the Emperour.</p>
               <p>Time quickly diſcovers the diſſembling, it coming clearly to be known, that the Revenue being left to <hi>Anna,</hi> a young Princeſs, as hath been ſaid, and ſhe married to the Duke of <hi>Medina de las Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> Vice-King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Governour and the Garriſon depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who with the Art of patience and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity came at laſt to the poſſeſſion of that, a ſole thought whereof had formerly raiſed jealouſies and ſtirs. Great was the ſorrow, with which in <hi>France</hi> they underſtood the agreement; <hi>Richelieu</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending, that to retain the old friends faithful, &amp; to acquire new ones in <hi>Italy,</hi> no means could have been more powerful, than vigorouſly to have maintained and protected him, that with ſo much fervency had diſcovered himſelf to ſide with that Crown. But if <hi>France</hi> with its diſtractions excuſed the abandoning of the Duke, he with his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:53750:221"/>
juſtified the agreement; ſo that admitting eaſily of his excuſes, the King aſſures him of his affection, and the Duke preſerved in his heart his inclinations entire to the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the reputation and intereſt of <hi>France</hi> had hereupon a great down-fall every where in <hi>Italy;</hi> whilſt the <hi>Griſons</hi> alſo, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that they were rather oppreſſed than ſuccoured by <hi>Rohan,</hi> ſhoke off the yoke, obtaining of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thoſe Conditions, which in the Treaty of <hi>Monzone</hi> they were to have had of the <hi>French.</hi> Out of the ſuppoſition to be reſtored to the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> or rather by the promiſe made them by <hi>Rohan,</hi> they were perſwaded to receive the Bridle of the Forts, and to concur in the Enterpriſe with Arms. The Duke then being preſſed by the three Leagues to put the Valley into their hands, now making ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and then propoſing Treaties, to the end to unite the minds of the people to their ancient Lords, affected delays. At laſt he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to adjuſt an agreement, in which they conſented, the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture remaining to thoſe of the <hi>Valteline</hi> and the exerciſe of the ſole Catholick Religion being permitted in the Valley. <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who, by reaſon of his deſigns upon <hi>Italy,</hi> deſired to retain that purchaſe, interpoſed ſeveral delays, and at laſt diſapproves of ſome of the Articles. Whereupon the <hi>Griſons,</hi> out of the deſire to recover the Valley, paſſing to impatience, and from thence into fury, plunge themſelves into the utmoſt extremities; the Duke, who after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat out of the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> had layn a long time ſick, not being able, by reaſon of his indiſpoſition, to imploy himſelf in perſon for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing their Aſſemblies, and Authority afar off ſerving for little, after having promiſed the <hi>Griſon</hi>-Militia, which mutined for want of pay, ſatisfaction within a time prefixed, the money not coming, they remained ſo much the more provoked and in diſorder. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons thereupon meeting publickly in Flanks, ſent Deputies to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpruch</hi> to demand aſſiſtance to drive away the <hi>French,</hi> and the Duke cauſing himſelf to be carried to <hi>Coira</hi> to reſtrain and delude them with new Propoſitions, found, how difficult it is, that a people ſhould ſuffer it ſelf to be long deceived; for he ſaw himſelf environed with Guards, though at large, yet in ſuch ſort, that it was not thought ſafe for him to return into the <hi>Valteline,</hi> where <hi>Monſieur de Leques</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with eight thouſand Souldiers. This wary proceeding of his was greatly blamed in <hi>France;</hi> it ſeeming, that the ſtate of affairs required, that reſolute and hazardous counſels ſhould have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before thoſe more prudent and cautious. There is no doubt but if <hi>Rohan</hi> could have joyned the Army in time, he might eaſily have ſuppreſſed that multitude, which, though it bluſtered boldly in the Diets, would have been found dejected and confuſed in the field. But time being given them, and with it boldneſs, there was concluded in the Court of <hi>Inſpruch</hi> by the Deputies of the three Leagues, with <hi>Frederico Enriques,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> a Treaty in which the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> was obliged, <hi>To pay to the</hi> Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>Souldiery ſuch advances as they pretended from the</hi> French; <hi>to drive them out of the</hi> Valteline <hi>with united Forces; reſtoring it to the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:53750:221"/>
three Leagues, with reſerve of the paſſages to the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual alliance betwixt the</hi> Milaneſe <hi>and</hi> Rhetia, <hi>beſides certain penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be paid by the King to the Commons and to private perſons, and the obligation to entertain in his ſervice a body of Souldiers of that Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Agreement was hardly made, but the Country, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the ratification, was ſeen in Arms, and the <hi>Griſon</hi> Troops revolted againſt the <hi>French</hi> Commanders; ſo that <hi>Rohan,</hi> the way towards the <hi>Valteline</hi> being ſtopped, was forced to retire into the Fort of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> with eighth hundred men of <hi>Zurich</hi> of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Smith,</hi> and two hundred <hi>French.</hi> Into ſome of the Paſſes that were abandoned the <hi>Griſons</hi> immediately entred; then, with ſix Regiments of that Nation, compleated with money from <hi>Spain,</hi> and with the aſſiſtance of certain Troops ſent from <hi>Gallas,</hi> they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the Fort. <hi>Serbellone</hi> advances to the <hi>Lago di Como,</hi> to keep <hi>Leques</hi> in diſtraction, who wanting orders from the Duke, beſieged in the Fort, was an idle Spectator of ſo important an iſſue, for which being highly blamed by the Duke himſelf, who having in vain demanded ſuccours of thoſe of <hi>Zurich,</hi> whilſt all were well pleaſed that the <hi>Griſons</hi> ſhould recover their own, was forced for want of Victuals to capitulate the ſurrender. The conditions were, <hi>That there ſhould remain a Garriſon of</hi> Swiſſes <hi>in the Fort for ſix weeks, within which the</hi> French <hi>were to go out of the</hi> Valteline <hi>and</hi> Rhetia, <hi>the Duke to be the Hoſtage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſhortneſs of the time prefixed was ſufficient to give advice of it into <hi>France;</hi> but not expect the remedy. Nevertheleſs, the <hi>French</hi> offered the reſtitution of all, provided the three Leagues would renounce the Treaty newly concluded with <hi>Spain;</hi> but they, calling to mind the vanity of paſt promiſes, would not at all alter it. <hi>Leques</hi> therefore was forced to go out of the Valley, and <hi>Smith</hi> delivers the Fort, though tempted by the <hi>French</hi> to declare himſelf, and keep it for the Crown, with a ſuppoſition ſuggeſted by <hi>Rohan,</hi> that <hi>Weimar</hi> advancing into thoſe parts, though the Fort ſhould be rendred, would yet repair again this inſult. But <hi>Richelieu,</hi> intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in more difficult matters, thought, for the preſent revenge was not to be minded. Thus, after many years of cruel Commotions, the Paſſes, ſo much deſired, remained open to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the <hi>Valteline</hi> returns to the ſubjection of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> condemned for no other cauſe to ſo many and ſo long miſeries, but to ſerve for an inlet into <hi>Italy.</hi> It was ſome time nevertheleſs before the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was fully accompliſhed, becauſe ſome difficulties being riſen betwixt the Ambaſſadors of the <hi>Griſons</hi> and the Governour of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> the buſineſs was remitted into <hi>Spain,</hi> where at laſt after two years it was determined, <hi>That the alone Catholick Religion ſhould be practiſed in the Valley; that for the judicial proceedings there ſhould be choſen two perſons, the one to be named by the Governour of</hi> Milan, <hi>and the other by the Leagues themſelves, to whom thoſe might have recourſe, that ſhould think themſelves grieved by the ſentences of the</hi> Griſon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:53750:222"/>The loſs of the <hi>Valteline</hi> was in ſome meaſure recompenſed by the recovery of the Iſlands of <hi>Eves;</hi> for, thirty ſeven Ships come out the Ocean into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and ſome Gallies, joined to them to diſtract the deſigns of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> fell upon the Iſland of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia,</hi> taking <hi>Oriſtan.</hi> The Squadron of <hi>Gianettino Doria</hi> haſtes thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome relief, and <hi>Leganes</hi> ſends from <hi>Milan</hi> Officers and Engineers. But the <hi>French</hi> not hoping for any progreſs in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> nor willing in that unwholſom air to conſume their Forces, ſet ſail towards <hi>Provence. Henry</hi> Count of <hi>Harcourt</hi> commanded the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, one of a hot ſpirit, full of courage, and nevertheleſs pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Againſt a Fort, which guarded the place of landing, were the firſt batteries of the Ships directed with ſo great fury, and in ſo great abundance, that in a ſhort time the defence by razing of the Parapet being ruined, and under the darkneſs of the ſmoak the men landed, and an aſſault given, the Garriſon was conſtrained to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it. The Fort of <hi>Montereii</hi> (for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had built many there) ran the ſame fortune. The Royal, and that of <hi>Aragon</hi> held out with a better defence. This maintained the Siege almoſt for a month, and then, a breach being made, capitulated. The other, by a longer reſiſtance, gave time to <hi>Michael Borgia</hi> to come near with the Gallies for its ſuccours. But not daring to ingage with Ships, turning head, leaves the Fort to be taken. The Governour, named <hi>Michael Sardo,</hi> after a Siege, for ſeveral weeks ſuſtained with bloody factions, capitulates, that if in eight days there came not in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of a thouſand Foot with Victuals for a month, to give up; as he did with about nine hundred Souldiers. And now, without delay, the other Iſland of St. <hi>Honorat</hi> was invaded; and there being but one ſole Fort there, <hi>Giovanni Tamaio</hi> after a few days ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it.</p>
               <p>At Land, to recompence the ſucceſſes of the foregoing <hi>Campag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> invaded with three Armies the Provinces of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> aiming chiefly at the taking of St. <hi>Omar;</hi> but found the Town ſo provided, and environed with ſo many Forts, that they thought beſt not to attempt it. <hi>La Valetta</hi> and <hi>Candale,</hi> who, being idle in the ſervice of the Republick, had obtained for ſome time leave from the Senate, with greater good luck took in <hi>Chateau Cambreſis</hi> in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,</hi> and having laid Siege before <hi>Landrecy,</hi> a ſmall place but of great importance, <hi>Meilleray</hi> arrives with powerful Forces to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of the glory, ſo that it was conſtrained to yield. The great Town of <hi>Maubeuge</hi> falls into the hand of <hi>Candale,</hi> who permitted his Army to uſe all cruelty in the ſacking of it. In <hi>Lutzemburg, Danvilliers,</hi> a good Town, after ſome days of Siege, made its terms with the Mareſhal <hi>de Chatiglion;</hi> and upon the Frontiers of <hi>France la Valetta</hi> recovers <hi>la Capelle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor did the Arms of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> enjoy leſs felicity; for with the force of Gold the negotiation of a Truce betwixt thoſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and <hi>Spain,</hi> being anew reſcinded by the <hi>French, Orange,</hi> having firſt in vain attempted the ſurpriſe of <hi>Hulſt,</hi> and of the Fort of <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipine,</hi> turns himſelf afterwards upon <hi>Breda,</hi> with ſo much force and
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:53750:222"/>
expedition, that the Cardinal <hi>Infante,</hi> not being able to ſuccour it in time, nor diſlodge the Enemy, applies himſelf to the taking in of <hi>Venlo,</hi> and <hi>Ruremond,</hi> which, as weak places neglected by the Prince, fell eaſily into his hands. But in the month of <hi>October, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> treated its delivery, a place, which <hi>Spinola</hi> being nine months in taking, and that with ſo much commotion of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſo great a conſumption of treaſure and men, came now in nine weeks to be regained without the leaſt diſaſter.</p>
               <p>The truth is, fortune every where confounded the counſels of <hi>Olivares,</hi> who, contrary to the opinion of ſome, that thought it not a courſe of advantage to attract the Arms of a potent Enemy into that part where he that provokes is the weakeſt, reſolves to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the flood out of the Low Countries, to draw the <hi>French</hi> to the Confines of <hi>Spain.</hi> He formed an Army of thoſe Troops for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly deſtined for the ſtrengthening of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and now calling from <hi>Naples</hi> new and powerful reinforcements, and from <hi>Milan</hi> the Count <hi>Serbellone</hi> to command, together with the Duke of <hi>Cardona,</hi> Viceroy in <hi>Catalogne,</hi> ſends them in the month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> into <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> to the Siege of <hi>Leucate,</hi> with hopes of a moſt certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, by reaſon of the ſituation amidſt Lakes and Fens, which by poſſeſſing certain narrow Dikes eaſily excluded ſuccours. Nor did the <hi>French</hi> Fleet appear ready to ſupply it; and the place it ſelf was ſo ill provided, that, notwithſtanding the notable conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Monſieur <hi>de Ravii</hi> in the defence of it, it was ready every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be taken. But <hi>Schomberg,</hi> Duke <hi>d' Alvin,</hi> and Governour of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> in ſo great a danger aſſembling the Gentry, and the Militia of the Province, and of others that were near, with ten thouſand Foot, and not many above a thouſand Horſe, comes cloſe to the Trenches, and, without giving time to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to take a conſiderate view of them, aſſaults them, forcing them in a very narrow paſſage. By which entring in the evening, they were forced, night coming upon them, to halt within the Enemies Camp. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſurpriſed could not or had not the skill to oppoſe them; but rather, conſidering that the day following it would be impoſſible to avoid a Battel, ſilently under the favour of the night retire, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Leucate</hi> free, the Camp empty, and forty piece of Cannon, with infinite Proviſions in the power of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From ſo many fortunate ſucceſſes ſome flattered themſelves, that the Cardinal having thus provided for his glory would more eaſily incline to Peace. It appeared nevertheleſs, that he became no leſs amorous of new Conqueſts, than <hi>Olivares</hi> was irritated at this his adverſity. And for this cauſe, although in both Courts a truce was propoſed by the Miniſters of the Pope and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and that the General of the <hi>Minims</hi> carried ſecretly from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Madrid</hi> projects betwixt the two favourites, yet nothing was concluded; becauſe in the Truce, the <hi>French</hi> would have their Confederates comprehended, and keep what they had gotten, and both the one and the other was denied by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not to treat with the <hi>Hollanders</hi> as equals, nor accuſtom their Enemies to a peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment for ſo many years of the places poſſeſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:53750:223"/>Hereupon aroſe quickly new difficulties, the <hi>French</hi> denying, as hath been ſaid elſewhere, to acknowledge <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third for King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſucceſſor into the Imperial Crown of his Father, who in the month of <hi>February</hi> of this year, being the fifty ninth of his age, yields to the frail condition of Mortality. This Prince had experienced ſuch various accidents of things proſperous and unfortunate, as may be equally obſerved, both for a teſtimony of divine Providence, and an example of humane viciſſitudes. From ſlender beginnings and a very narrow condition, he roſe to great hopes, and afterwards to greater power, amidſt the oppoſitions and treacheries of Strangers, and of Subjects; but they being brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the other conquered, for the overcoming alſo of jealouſie and envy he wanted nothing but the moderation of counſels. He had a tryal therefore of the reflux of Fortune with ſuch blows, as made him ſee his Greatneſs panting under the Forces of a King almoſt unknown and deſpiſed. But the death of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> aſcribed to a blow from Heaven; the Victory at <hi>Nortlinghen</hi> no leſs ſeaſonable than great; and the Peace of <hi>Prague,</hi> which contented the chief of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, confirmed to the Son all the Dignity of the Father. It was looked at as a great miracle, nay rather a ſingular protection from Heaven; that the Election of a King of the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould ſucceed ſo opportunely, and that after ſo great agitations and ſo many cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities the Patrimony untouched, together with an hundred and ten thouſand men in Arms ſhould remain to the Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied, but that to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned a moſt deſerved ſtation amidſt the beſt deſerving Princes, who have received Splendour and Renown from the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; for that with fervent zeal he propagated it in the Hereditary Provinces, nay rather may be ſaid to have reſtored it by Example, by Laws, and by Arms. He was ſingular in piety, conſtant in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and inflexible in all Fortunes. Some laid to his charge a too much yielding to the opinions of others, with a too violent heat in execution; an undiſtinguiſhed liberality in giving; and a too pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent tolerance of ſo many exceſſes, with which his Souldiery and Generals afflicted <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy.</hi> But his vertues were his own; his faults were aſcribed to Fortune and the Times.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Third taken into the Empire in the nine and twentieth year of his Age, the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to congratulate him, ſent <hi>Renieri Zeno,</hi> Cavalier and Procurator, and <hi>Angelo Contarini</hi> Cavalier, by whom they ſollicited the conceſſion of Paſs-ports to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the agreement of a Meeting for Peace, and the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> alſo cooperating therein with his endeavours; thoſe for <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> were conſented to by the new Emperour, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that they ſhould not be delivered to the parties, till after <hi>France</hi> ſhould have diſpatched his own, for his Miniſters, with Titles and Quality of Emperour. But the Meeting being ſtill more and more prolonged, military ſucceſſes were in this year reciprocally ballanced in <hi>Germany;</hi> for the <hi>Swedes</hi> having purſued the <hi>Saxons,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Erfordt</hi> in <hi>Thuringia,</hi> and advanced into <hi>Francony,</hi> were by them
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:53750:223"/>
joyned with <hi>Gallas,</hi> forced back to the Frontiers of <hi>Pomerania.</hi> There <hi>Banier,</hi> re-inforced with <hi>Wranghel,</hi> makes head a new, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the others, through want of Proviſions and Pay, to retire back. After this <hi>Hermeſtain,</hi> kept by the <hi>French,</hi> being rendred to <hi>Werdt,</hi> was depoſited into the hands of the Elector of <hi>Collen,</hi> till the cauſe of him of <hi>Triers,</hi> to whom that place belonged, ſhould be decided. <hi>Werdt</hi> after this draws near to <hi>Hanau,</hi> and <hi>Weimar</hi> haſtes with ſpeed to its ſuccours, wherein he was not able to ſucceed, though he beat the Duke <hi>Carlo</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who had attempted to hinder him in his way.</p>
               <p>The Duke therefore turns his march into the <hi>Franche Conté,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to poſſeſs <hi>Beſanzon,</hi> an Imperial City, but in vain; and thereupon goes into <hi>Alſace,</hi> leaving <hi>Hanau</hi> to be taken by <hi>Werdt.</hi> He after the place gained follows him, joyned with the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velli</hi> and other Chiefs, and ſeeing <hi>Weimar</hi> ingaged under <hi>Rhinfeldt,</hi> attacques him, obliging him with the loſs of his Cannon to riſe. In this Encounter <hi>Rohan,</hi> who was with Duke <hi>Bernard,</hi> received ſuch a hurt, that he a while after dyed, leaving the Arms, he was wont to wear, to the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> as a gift of affection and Monument of that Renown, which inrolled him in the number of the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Captains of the World. The Imperialiſts not contenting themſelves with this ſucceſs, by purſuing the Victory loſt it; whilſt at <hi>Laufenburg,</hi> whither <hi>Weimar</hi> was gone, they attacqued him, and he made appear of what importance is the Courage of an excellent Captain; for, inferior in Reputation and Forces he encounters them, and fights them with ſo great reſolution, that he defeats them, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting almoſt all to the Sword, poſſeſſing Cannon and Baggage, taking the Colours, and numbring amongſt the Priſoners of Quality <hi>Werdt</hi> himſelf, and <hi>Enchefurt. Rheinfeld,</hi> under which <hi>Weimar</hi> returned, was the reward of the Victory, and after that <hi>Neoburg</hi> and <hi>Friburg</hi> followed.</p>
               <p>That nevertheleſs happened in the year following; but for the preſent in <hi>Italy</hi> the War being tranſported out of the Country of <hi>Parma</hi> into the <hi>Monferrat, Leganes</hi> feigned to himſelf great progreſs, finding himſelf ſtrong eighteen thouſand Foot and five thouſand Horſe, with all ſorts of other proviſions. But his hopes were not ſeconded by the event. In the <hi>Langhe, Martino d'Aragona</hi> took in <hi>Ponzone</hi> to open the way of ſuccours by Sea and the Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>Final. Gilles de Haes,</hi> intending to ſurpriſe <hi>Nizza della Paglia,</hi> arrived there ſo late in the day, that he was eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. And not thinking it honourable to retreat, fortifies himſelf in a Convent, obliging <hi>Leganes,</hi> who by the weakneſs of the place hoped for a ſhort conqueſt of it, to repair thither with the whole Army. Nor was he deceived; for after four days the Governour renders it, there going forth four hundred <hi>Monferrins,</hi> two hundred forty <hi>French,</hi> and ſome Horſe <hi>Savoyards.</hi> Thence paſſing into the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Aſti,</hi> orders <hi>Philippo di Silva</hi> to take in <hi>Algiano,</hi> which eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceded. With the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who complained of the Invaſion of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who did not willingly
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:53750:224"/>
hear of his prejudice, the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> juſtified himſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, that he was not bound to uſe reſpect, where he found Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons of that Nation, which with moleſtations and jealouſies afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Frontiers of the <hi>Milaneſe.</hi> But the progreſs of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Arms quickly terminated in this period; for <hi>Crequi</hi> returned out of <hi>France,</hi> where he had been to juſtifie his paſt conduct, joyning with ſix thouſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe <hi>Savoyards,</hi> attempted <hi>la Rocca d'Araſſo,</hi> a little before taken by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but <hi>Leganes</hi> coming near with all the Army, he was conſtrained to retire. This Campagnia afterwards ended with certain Incurſions and ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters betwixt <hi>Brem</hi> and <hi>Vercelli,</hi> which were of no ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where <hi>Villa</hi> beat <hi>Arragona</hi> with the death of ſome Officers on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſide, and among them <hi>Spadino,</hi> the known Promoter of the firſt Siege of <hi>Caſal;</hi> and the ſame Chiefs not far from <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldone</hi> putting it to a new tryal, <hi>Aragona</hi> went away with the worſt, who hardly ſaving himſelf by flight, abandoned ſix Cannons and his Baggage.</p>
               <p>After theſe the accidents of Nature promoted new and unthought of ſucceſſes; for <hi>Italy,</hi> greatly afflicted by the death of two of its Princes, opened the boſom to new ſtrokes. The Duke <hi>Vittorio</hi> in <hi>Vercelli</hi> upon the ſeventh of <hi>October,</hi> in the one and fiftieth year of his Age, ended his days with various judgments upon the nature of his ſickneſs, there wanting not ſome, who imputed it to poyſon, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Crequi,</hi> either for private hatred, or the publick diſtruſts of the Crown; and they drew their argument from an invitation, where were with the Duke the Count <hi>de Verrua,</hi> his moſt confident Miniſter, and the Marqueſs <hi>Villa,</hi> the moſt faithful General of his Army, of which falling ſick together with the Duke, the firſt dyed, and the other hardly by the ſtrength of his complexion overcame the accidents. Others believed, that the powder of Diamonds, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him ſome time before, had corroded his inward parts. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the <hi>French</hi> are abhorring ſuch Arts, it ought not to ſeem ſtrange, that the Duke, macerated with many cares and tedious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions in the decline of his age, ſhould run the common Fate; ſo that in ſuch caſes of doubt and concealment, it is more beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give credit to Nature than authorize falſhood. Let it be as it will; he left with three Daughters two Sons, both very young, and to them War for an Inheritance, and for a Patrimony the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of one of the Crowns, and the diſtruſt of the other, without ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of any ſincere friendſhip. <hi>Franceſco Giacinto,</hi> the eldeſt, having ſcarce taſted the benefit of life, but not of command, was after a few months ſnatched away by death, leaving the Title to <hi>Carlo Emanuel</hi> his Brother.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vittorio</hi> dead, the Tutelage and Regency were aſſumed by the Dutcheſs <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> alledging the Will of her Huſband expreſſed in his Teſtament, which committed it to her alone. The Princes, <hi>Maurice</hi> the Cardinal, and <hi>Tomaſo,</hi> pretended to have a ſhare in it, and preſſed it ſo much the more as believing the life of the little Duke doubtful, by reaſon of his tender age and weak conſtitution,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:53750:224"/>
and becauſe by the Laws of the Country Women being excluded, they were incouraged to conceive great hopes, that the Succeſſion might devolve to them. For which cauſe the Cardinal, who reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Rome,</hi> leaves the Court, notwithſtanding that the Pope, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of what happened, endeavoured to ſtop him with offers of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments and advantages. He, come to the Borders of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and finding an Order there from the Dutcheſs, that he ſhould retire further off, with a promiſe, if he did, of ſatisfaction and an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, things being not yet in a condition to uſe force, retired into the <hi>Genoueſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Lewis,</hi> freed from thoſe ſuſpicions, in which the deep and wiſe Conduct of the Duke <hi>Vittorio</hi> held him, was glad to ſee his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Regent, who, ſince ſhe could not adhere to her Brothers-in-law, nor put truſt in them, remained conſtrained to ſhelter her ſelf under his protection. On the other ſide the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by reaſon of this dependence and conjunction of Blood, endeavoured to have her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, or at leaſt that ſhe might govern with an Authority ſo limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reſtrained, that ſhe might not be able to bring prejudice to their intereſts. Expecting therefore accidents from time, <hi>Leganes</hi> was not ſolicitous to make advantage in that Conjuncture with Arms, ſave only that he took in the Caſtle of <hi>Pomar</hi> in <hi>Monferrat,</hi> which he abandoned ſo ſoon as he ſaw <hi>Crequi</hi> joyned again with <hi>Villa.</hi> Theſe two Chiefs were joyned, notwithſtanding their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts, grown even to publick diſtruſt, from the time that <hi>Crequi,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion from the death of the Duke, had attempted to caſt a Garriſon of <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Vercelli,</hi> and <hi>Villa</hi> had prevented him by bringing in a ſtrong Renfort of <hi>Savoyards.</hi> The other accident, which gave no leſs apprehenſion to <hi>Italy,</hi> was the death of <hi>Carlo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> upon the 21. of <hi>September</hi> in the ſixty and one year of his age. He, whilſt he lived privately, had had ſeveral thoughts and deſigns of a great Prince; but having attained the Principality with great hazard, governed himſelf amidſt great troubles with the ſpirit and manners of a private man.</p>
               <p>The Succeſſion fell to <hi>Carlo,</hi> Nephew of the Duke deceaſed, and Son of the Prince <hi>Carlo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Rhetel,</hi> yet in Minority, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recommended by Teſtament and by a Codicil of the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to the protection of the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and to the Regency of the Mother, a Princeſs of a moſt prudent underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who, altering nothing of the preſent ſtate of things, requires the Oath in the name of the Son, and ſends to <hi>Venice</hi> the Senator <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leoni</hi> to obtain the continuance of the aſſiſtance and the direction of the Senate. The Republick doubling, to the end to preſerve that State, their diligence, paſſed immediately effectual offices with the Emperour to divert all thoughts of novelty, and in <hi>Spain</hi> uſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, to the end the <hi>Infanta Maria</hi> ſhould have no thoughts of returning to <hi>Mantua</hi> to ſow unſeaſonable ſuſpicions. Nor was it difficult to obtain it; for although the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were not pleaſed at the aſſiſtance of <hi>Monſieur de la Tour,</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Commander in <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua;</hi> yet fancying to themſelves greater advantages on the ſide of

It applied it ſelf beſides, according to its Inſtitutions, ſo much the more to the Arts of Peace, by how much it was eſteemed to excel in thoſe of diſburdening the Treaſury of thoſe many debts contracted by the long expences of the paſt Wars; it being its ancient cuſtom in times of Peace to recover ſtrength, to the end to uſe it more powerfully, where Fortune ſhould preſent new occaſion of troubles.

               <p>The Count of <hi>Monterey</hi> tranſporting himſelf from the Viceregen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Naples</hi> by Sea into <hi>Spain,</hi> and paſſing by <hi>Genoua</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this preſent year, the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> met at <hi>Pegli</hi> in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and grave Aſſembly concerning the ſtate of affairs and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the future Campagnia, in which occaſion was opened to them of great advantages.

He not able to reſt ſo ſatisfied, had a mind to make a new tryal, when, as he was viewing the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for planting of a Battery which might oblige the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to retreat, being taken with a Cannon-bullet left his life upon that place, together with the opinion of a Captain, that for ſo many years paſt had rather had a name in <hi>Italy</hi> than been fortunate. Wanting then a head, almoſt all the <hi>French</hi> Souldiers, who were not many, diſbanded, and the Officers repaſſed the <hi>Alps;</hi> ſo that <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes</hi> had now liberty, almoſt without oppoſition, to continue the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:53750:225"/>
Siege. The Garriſon without hope of relief defended it ſelf but weakly. Five Batteries were raiſed with twenty pieces on them. A Scalade having been attempted in vain, approaches were opened, and an Out-work, called Horn-work, being gained, could not be kept, the beſieged ſtill recovering it.</p>
               <p>The place at laſt being more preſſed by the attacque of <hi>Carlo della Gatta Neopolitan,</hi> than elſewhere, was rendred. The Garriſon, which went out to the number of eighteen hundred men, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to <hi>Caſal,</hi> and there the Governour, whoſe name was <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaiard,</hi> had his head taken off. To him, who of mean birth was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the favour of <hi>Crequi</hi> to ſo important a Government, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, that he had weakened the defence by appropriating to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more pays, and haſtened the ſurrender to ſave the money he had gotten, ſo that he made good by his puniſhment, that baſeneſs ſeldom finds an eſcape, eſpecially when too much covetouſneſs is that which procures it. To divert the new Regent from joyning her Forces to attempt the preſervation of the place, and to make it believed, that <hi>Piedmont</hi> was in no danger, <hi>Leganes</hi> had ſent to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua</hi> the Abbot <hi>Vaſques,</hi> that with the Cavalier <hi>Ogliani,</hi> ſent thither from the Dutcheſs at the ſuggeſtion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the means might be diſcourſed of to compoſe the differences with the Brothers-in-law and with the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> But it being difficult in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes to keep diſſimulation long concealed, the Meeting was quickly diſſolved, the <hi>Savoyards</hi> perceiving that all tended to retard <hi>French</hi> ſuccours, and give time for the Orders from <hi>Spain.</hi> And they came at laſt very poſitive, that the Armies ſhould be imployed in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> that the Princes ſhould be incouraged, calling back from <hi>Rome Maurice,</hi> who was returned thither, and <hi>Thomaſo</hi> from <hi>Flanders,</hi> to the end, that not only with military ſkill, but with the authority of the name, and the affection of the Subjects, the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Crown might be facilitated. The Dutcheſs found her ſelf now in very great ſtraights, environed with ſuſpicions and with treacheries, the minds of the people alienated, and the ſuccour ſcanty, which ſhe hoped for from <hi>France;</hi> for that <hi>Richelieu,</hi> to bring her to his will, choſe to leave her in danger. <hi>Leganes,</hi> by the taking of <hi>Breme,</hi> proud to have driven the Enemy out of the <hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> and by the Intelligence he had in it hoping certainly to get himſelf into <hi>Caſal,</hi> advances to <hi>Vercelli</hi> in the month of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs was now forced to caſt her ſelf into the arms of the <hi>French,</hi> by concluding a Treaty that obliged her, <hi>To make War for two years with the</hi> Spaniards <hi>and the Princes their adherents, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three thouſand Foot and twelve hundred Horſe to thirteen thouſand five hundred men, which the King, without pretending repayment of charges, but rather paying for his Quarters, obliged himſelf to maintain in</hi> Italy. <hi>The King promiſed not to make Peace but by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and without the Inveſtiture ſhould be conferred on the Duke by the Emperour in the ſame manner as his Father had obtained it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the limitation of time mentioned in the Treaty, it was yet viſible, that <hi>Savoy</hi> was in ſuch ſort ingaged with <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:53750:226"/>
that it had no means to diſ-intangle it ſelf; <hi>Piedmont</hi> remaining a free and open field for the <hi>French</hi> Armies, which ſhould not only enjoy Quarters at diſcretion, but have every place ready to open the Gates to them. Nor was the conjecture groundleſs; for the Dutcheſs not knowing in whom among her Subjects ſhe might put confidence, of a ſudden under the ſhew of giving a months pay, brought a good number of <hi>French</hi> for her ſecurity into <hi>Turin;</hi> and levying a Regiment of that Nation in her own Name to colour the Juggle, committed to them the keeping of the Citadel. A while after the Cardinal <hi>de la Vallette</hi> arrives in <hi>Italy</hi> to command the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but not followed with Forces proportionable to what was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nevertheleſs applies himſelf immediately to view and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the places, and coming into <hi>Caſal,</hi> diſcovers the contrivance, which <hi>Leganes</hi> framed there, whereof <hi>Ottavio Montiglio,</hi> with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Princeſs Dowager, being the Author, who commanded there for the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> by ſeizing upon him the deſign to introduce the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was broken.</p>
               <p>But of ſuccouring <hi>Vercelli,</hi> the Cardinal found himſelf not in a condition to hope for a happy event; becauſe, beſides the weakneſs of the <hi>French</hi> Forces, all things in <hi>Piedmont</hi> were tranſacted between confuſion and jealouſies. In the Town they endured great wants; for from the very beginning of the Siege they were unprovided of many things, with a Garriſon unequal to the largeneſs of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit. The Marqueſs <hi>Dogliani,</hi> the Governour, with ſkill and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſupplied ſome of them, by maintaining ſome Poſts, and with frequent Sallies keeping the Enemy at a diſtance. Nevertheleſs <hi>Leganes</hi> having perfected the Circumvallation, which was extended into a great compaſs, in regard of the ſituation and of the River <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> which formed certain Iſlands and Flats, proſecuted the Siege in great earneſt. The Cardinal, who aſſembled his Army with great difficulty, by inceſſant rains retarded his march for ſome days. At laſt, the Dutcheſs being come to <hi>Creſcentino,</hi> to incourage the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, he preſents himſelf before the Line, but not having vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour to force it, <hi>Leganes</hi> amuſed him by ſkirmiſhing with his Horſe, not intermitting at all the Siege, but having pierced in ſeveral parts into the Ditch, took two Half-moons by aſſault, and lodged his men upon a Baſtion. <hi>Dogliani</hi> for all this made an undaunted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, ſeeing ſuccours at hand, and <hi>Vallette</hi> in ſight, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to bring it in, traverſing about, viewing Situations, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing Poſts with greater application than force. The Cardinal, having corrupted, as was ſaid, a Sentinel, ſends into <hi>Vercelli</hi> through the middle of the <hi>Germans</hi> Quarter, negligently kept, a thouſand Foot. But they not ſuffering to ſlacken the Siege, ſome Officers being exemplarily puniſhed, that were found guilty of negligence, <hi>Leganes</hi> redoubled his Force, cloſed up his Lines into a narrower com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, haſtened the Works, and the <hi>French</hi> for a diverſion threatning the Fort of <hi>Sandoval,</hi> he aſſembles another body of an Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Cardinal <hi>Trivulſio,</hi> and compoſed of ſome <hi>Switzers</hi> and Foreign Souldiery to maintain it. So that <hi>Vallette,</hi> not to be
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:53750:226"/>
taken in the middle betwixt them was forced to withdraw further off; but for the laſt attempt, in concert with the beſieged he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to poſſeſs a certain Iſland of the <hi>Seſia,</hi> and that deſign not ſucceeding, he had a mind in another place with a furious battery to incommodate the Enemies Camp. But all in vain, for the Town having loſt the Outworks, and having breaches open, and mines rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Enemies lodged upon a Baſtion, the Cardinal plundring <hi>Paleſtre</hi> retired, and <hi>Dogliani,</hi> in the end of <hi>June,</hi> renders upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable conditions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> upon this ſucceſs diſcouraged, and the <hi>Savoyards</hi> in diſorder, <hi>Leganes</hi> had opportunity and time for greater progreſs. But, applying himſelf firſt to provide and repair <hi>Vercelli,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards falling ſick, leaves to <hi>Franciſco de Melo</hi> the command of the Army, which made no other Conqueſt but <hi>Pomar,</hi> where they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed the Caſtle. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> who, after the ill ſeconded confidences with this Houſe, obſerved the intereſts of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking further care of it watched ſo much the more diligently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Affairs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> where, it ſeemed, quiet began to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by the various diſguſts of the Princeſs at the <hi>French.</hi> She, preſently aſſuming the Government, let it be ſeen, that ſhe would no longer depend alone upon that Crown; but deſired alſo the friendſhip of <hi>Spain,</hi> and, under the ſhadow and confidence of the Empreſs Dowager her Aunt, rely upon the Emperour with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecurity and honour.</p>
               <p>It ſeemed, that the <hi>French</hi> were now, both in <hi>Caſal</hi> and in the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> rather givers of the Law than protectors. Whereupon ſhe ſets on foot at <hi>Vienna</hi> and in <hi>Milan</hi> ſecret practices, and to make her ſelf abſolute in the command, confides to the Marqueſs <hi>Guerriero,</hi> that depended on her, the Government of <hi>Porio,</hi> and commits the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Duke to the Count <hi>Scipio Arrigoni,</hi> which charge the Marqueſs <hi>Cauriani</hi> had firſt ſupplied.</p>
               <p>For theſe conſiderations, the <hi>French,</hi> touched with a vehement diſtruſt, ſent to <hi>Mantua</hi> Monſieur <hi>de la Thuillerie,</hi> who reſided Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador in <hi>Venice;</hi> though the Senate did not believe it as yet ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to irritate any further with troubleſom inſtances the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful mind of that young Princeſs, jealous above meaſure of her authority. But, the <hi>French</hi> thinking to break all Treaty, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had diſcovered it, did but haſten it. <hi>La Thuillerie</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the new Miniſters being removed, ſhe would continue to make uſe of the old, and moſt truſty to the Crown; and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs mingling reaſons with excuſes, under pretext that ſhe would inform the King about it, took time, ſuſpending in the interim for ſome days the Marqueſs <hi>Guerriero,</hi> for a ſhew, from the Government; and joining to <hi>Arrigoni</hi> the Count <hi>della Roſchie</hi> Chamberlain to the Duke deceaſed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> nevertheleſs were not content; for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and at <hi>Venice</hi> particularly the Ambaſſador <hi>della Rocca,</hi> aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a manner publickly the protection of the Regents, preſſed the Senate, that it would interpoſe to remove thoſe moleſtations and
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:53750:227"/>
inſtances, which tended to exerciſe with the Princeſs prepotency and command, rather than friendſhip or counſel. The ſaid Princeſs diſpatching to <hi>Venice,</hi> as Amboſſador extraordinary, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſucceſſion of her Son, the Marqueſs <hi>Nicolo Gonzaga,</hi> ſtrengthened thoſe Offices; nor was the Senate wanting, by the means of <hi>Angelo Corraro</hi> Cavalier, its Ambaſſador at <hi>Paris,</hi> and by <hi>Luigi Molino,</hi> ſent Ambaſſador extraordinary to <hi>Mantua,</hi> to employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by all means poſſible, to ſweeten the diſguſts, and qualifie embitterments. But the Biſhop of <hi>Caſal</hi> being ſent from <hi>Mantua</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> to inform the King how things ſtood, and at the ſame time the Marqueſs <hi>Giovanni Sigiſmond Gonzaga</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the inveſtiture, there came to the Princeſs the Count <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Attimis</hi> with a Secretary in the name of the Empreſs her Aunt, under pretence to counſel; her and from <hi>Milan</hi> arriving <hi>Diego Saia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedra</hi> under colour of a complement, a ſecret Treaty was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and the Princeſs her ſelf, which aimed at driving the <hi>French</hi> Garriſon out of <hi>Caſal.</hi> And now the Miniſters of that Crown having diſcovered it, but willing to diſſemble it, departed from <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua; la Tuillerie,</hi> becauſe Monſieur <hi>de Huſſé</hi> had ſucceeded him in the Ambaſſage of <hi>Venice,</hi> retiring himſelf to <hi>Padua</hi> for his health, and <hi>la Tour</hi> for devotion taking a Voyage to <hi>Loretto.</hi> The Princeſs, glad to have removed their aſſiſtance farther off, ſends the Count <hi>Arrivabene,</hi> her chief Secretary of State, to <hi>Venice,</hi> to let the Senate know, that for many diſguſts, which ſhe pretended, ſhe could no longer admit <hi>la Tour,</hi> but that her ſelf, having aſſumed the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralat of the Army, had no need of another perſon of that Nation to command it. She complained, that <hi>Montiglio</hi> had been beheaded in <hi>Caſal,</hi> by order of the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, and that it was believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Paris,</hi> that her ſelf had not only knowledge, but was au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the contrived betraying of the place. On the other ſide, Monſieur <hi>de la Tuillerie,</hi> being returned to <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſollicited, that ſhe would put the Marqueſs <hi>Guerriero</hi> from the Government of <hi>Porto,</hi> to which he was reſtored, and alſo one <hi>della Valle,</hi> believed a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the intelligences diſcovered in <hi>Caſal.</hi> The Princeſs, profeſſing her ſelf ignorant of the Plot, rejected the inſtances, as contrary to her liberty and the dignity of her Son. <hi>La Thuillerie</hi> acquieſced not; but perceiving at laſt, that the Emperour had declared, that he would ſend a Commiſſary of his to <hi>Mantua,</hi> if the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> ſhould abide any longer there, he departs, leaving the Count <hi>Bonzi Florentine</hi> as Reſident.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſeeing that theſe troubles might break forth into worſe accidents, re-inforced the Garriſon of <hi>Mantua</hi> to the number of five thouſand men, and ſent another party to the Confines, to be ready to be brought in, if there ſhould be need. About this time hapned a notable encounter at Sea, betwixt the Gallies of the two Crowns. <hi>Roderigo Velaſco</hi> with fifteen of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> had diſ-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued Souldiers at <hi>Vado;</hi> and in his going thence was overtaken over againſt <hi>Genua</hi> by Monſieur <hi>de Poncurlé,</hi> who with an equal number followed him. The Fight was bloody ſeparating with a
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:53750:227"/>
number in a manner equal of hurt and dead, but with a different loſs of Ships; for the <hi>French</hi> took five, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> three. But the ſucceſs of the Armies either weak or unfortunate, which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed elſewhere, had not the ſame iſſue; for the Mareſhals <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> and <hi>la Force</hi> being come before St. <hi>Omer,</hi> Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> ſeizing on a ſituation fit to incamp his Army, brought ſuccours twice into it; and afterwards forcing a Quarter, obliged them to retire: ſo that the Campagnia ended in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> without other Conqueſt but of the weak Caſtle of <hi>Renti,</hi> which was demoliſhed, and of the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> which being re-aſſieged by <hi>Monſieur de Halier,</hi> was after the ſpringing of two Mines recovered by aſſault, and the Garriſon of ſix hundred <hi>Spaniards</hi> cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to ſecond theſe enterpriſes, being by concert come into the field, 5000 men under Count <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their courſe towards the <hi>Scheld</hi> to take in thoſe Forts, which defending the Dikes preſerve the Country from Inundations, and ſurpriſed ſome of them, particularly that of <hi>Callo;</hi> but being come to the other of <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops flocking thither, they were defeated with the loſs of many drowned in the low Lands, and others taken Priſoners. The Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> not daunted with this unhappy ſucceſs, attempts with the groſs of his Army the Town of <hi>Gueldre;</hi> but the Cardinal <hi>Infante</hi> coming to its ſuccours, together with <hi>Lamboy,</hi> who brought to him five thouſand Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, aſſaults the Quarters of Count <hi>Henry Caſimir de Naſſau</hi> with ſo great ſucceſs, that paſſing over certain Trenches not yet perfected, he took him Priſoner, and put in ſuch relief, as obliged the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to riſe and abandon ſome pieces of Cannon in the waters, which being let in ſeveral ways by the beſieged, overflowed the whole Country.</p>
               <p>Nor was the Fortune of the <hi>French</hi> much better on the Frontiers of <hi>Spain,</hi> whether, to carry the War into the Enemies own Country, the Cardinal had reſolved to bring an Army. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> having in <hi>Guyenne</hi> aſſembled a body of twelve thouſand men, comes to the Port of <hi>Paſſagge,</hi> where poſſeſſing himſelf of certain Ships, which were there ready built, he burnt others which were in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, laying Siege afterward to <hi>Fontarabie,</hi> a Frontier place, and the Key of <hi>Navarre,</hi> placed, like a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> in a very ſtrong ſituation, where the <hi>Vidaſſo</hi> diſburdening it ſelf, opens a paſſage to receive the flowings of the Sea. It is beyond belief, in what a commotion the Kingdoms of <hi>Spain</hi> were, being not accuſtomed to be ſenſible of an Enemy at home, and under the guard of opinion and pride to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a peaceable calm. Whereupon the Nobility and Souldiery flocking to ſtrives from all parts, an Army was quickly formed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Admirant of <hi>Caſtille;</hi> which, conſiſting of puiſſant Forces, draws near to the <hi>French</hi> Camp. The enterpriſe, by reaſon of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the diſunion of the Chiefs, proceeded more ſlowly than was imagined, giving time to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army to preſent it ſelf, which appearing at unawares, came before the Line to give an aſſault. <hi>Conde</hi> knowing that on that ſide ſome Troops had the Guard of the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:53750:228"/>
Trenches, the Chiefs whereof, and among them the Duke of <hi>Valet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> eſpecially, he had in ſuſpicion of Intelligence with the Enemy, ſent others to re-inforce thoſe Poſts; but the firſt being reſolute not to give them place, they turned their diſcontent and arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another, leaving almoſt without conteſt the paſſage to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>de Torrecuſo</hi> was the firſt that attac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued the Line; but he of <hi>Mortara</hi> had the honour to get in before him on the other ſide, ſeconded afterward by the whole Army, with ſo little blood, that ſixteen only were killed, and one hundred and fifty reckoned to be hurt. On the <hi>French</hi> ſide all was confuſion, flight, and fear, leaving to the Conquerours the field full of Booty, Arms, and other Proviſions.</p>
               <p>The News was received in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> both for the loſs and the diſhonour, with great trouble of mind, becauſe it looked as if the fidelity and prudence of the Chiefs had rather been wanting than Fortune or the Force of Arms. <hi>Conde</hi> was ſufficiently blamed for negligence, and that not disjoyned from the great greedineſs of gain, with which he had carried on the enterpriſe, and he upbraided the Duke <hi>de la Vallette</hi> with infidelity and want of care to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he, to avoid the threatning anger of the Cardinal, retired himſelf to <hi>London,</hi> and his Father, the Duke of <hi>Eſpernon,</hi> was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to betake himſelf to a private life, abandoning his Government of <hi>Guyenne.</hi> So joyful a Victory being applauded in <hi>Spain</hi> with great Feſtivals, the King rewards the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke with extraordinary pre-eminences and advantages, as if the Fortune of the Army had taken its life from his alone direction, not without the murmuring of thoſe, who having been expoſed to dangers and the ingagements in the field, ſaw one alone in the idleneſs of the Court go away with the recompences and the glory. The War being ſcattered and ſpread into ſo many parts, the variety of relations, which for the moſt part delights, interrupting at preſent too often the ſeries of diſcourſes, make them in a manner ſeem tedious.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Weimar</hi> aſpired in <hi>Germany</hi> to eſtabliſh for himſelf a Soveraign State, and although with money and aſſiſtance from <hi>France</hi> he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the War, he nevertheleſs directed it to his own advantages. After the Victory formerly related, with the places taken, he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed almoſt all <hi>Alſace,</hi> a Province of the ancient Patrimony of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> both by its ſituation and extent held to be of great importance. He now ſets forth to beſiege <hi>Briſach,</hi> a place ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong, with a Bridge over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and by conſequence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Navigation of the River and for paſſage by Land, and driving the Siege to a concluſion, forces it to render, having fruſtrated all diligence of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> to relieve it. This was the moſt renowned action which happened in <hi>Germany;</hi> for in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, <hi>Oxenſtern</hi> being paſſed into <hi>Sweden</hi> to diſpoſe and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite the Senate for ſuccours, landed in <hi>Pomerania</hi> with new ſupplies for the Army, with which <hi>Banier</hi> being rendred more vigorous and bold, poſſeſſes many places, which <hi>Gallas</hi> retiring abandoned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles Lodowick,</hi> Son of the deceaſed <hi>Palatine,</hi> who was elect
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:53750:228"/>
King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>England</hi> and the favour of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who aſſigned to him for his place of Arms <hi>Minden</hi> and <hi>Oſnabrug,</hi> had raiſed in <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> ten thouſand men, with which, joyning with <hi>Melander,</hi> General for the <hi>Heſſens,</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to attempt the recovery of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> or the Conqueſt of ſome other Country, which might be equal to it; but being met, ſo ſoon as he began to march, by the Count of <hi>Hatsfelt,</hi> General of that Circle, and for the Catholick Electors, was in ſuch ſort defeated, that his Troops could never re-unite, and <hi>Oſnabrug</hi> rendred it ſelf to the Conquerours, who with very little blood obtained a very notable Victory.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Priſoners remained in the hands of the Imperialiſts <hi>Robert,</hi> Brother to <hi>Charles Lodowick,</hi> who conducted to <hi>Lintz,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Emperour to be exchanged with <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> Brother of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus,</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> fallen into the hands of the <hi>French</hi> as he was paſſing by Sea out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Spain.</hi> But <hi>France</hi> would not yield their conſent; for pretending for cauſe of the arreſt, that the Prince went to bear Arms in favour of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the miſchiefs heretofore done by the <hi>Polach</hi> Cavalry under the Emperours Colours, <hi>Richelieu</hi> thought it a very ſeaſonable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, treating with that Kingdom to make a friendſhip, and drawing profit from the accident, hinder the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, which they were wont to enjoy in <hi>Poland,</hi> eſpecially Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies. And therefore were of little avail for the liberty of the Prince the offices of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who being expreſly deſired by the King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus,</hi> through the means of the Baron <hi>Biboni</hi> his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyé Extraordinary, to interpoſe themſelves, had for that purpoſe made choice of <hi>Angelo Contarini</hi> Cavalier for Ambaſſadour Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to King <hi>Lodowick:</hi> But getting knowledge of the inclination of the King and of the Miniſter, the Miſſion was ſuſpended; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> was obliged to diſpatch thither an Embaſſie expreſs, by which he obtained the liberty of his Brother with a ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he would never more bear Arms againſt <hi>France;</hi> that the King and the Kingdom ſhould not pretend diſguſt by this arreſt; that by <hi>Poland</hi> Levies ſhould not in future be permitted to the Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> nor Alliances made with them to its prejudice. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Peace languiſhed this year as formerly, notwithſtanding the preſſing of the Mediators to obtain the Paſs ports; becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Fate of great buſineſſes, to find the beginning always full of trouble, delays and difficulties, were on all ſides affected, to gain time for deſigns and the hopes of their Arms.</p>
               <p>But in the month of <hi>March</hi> was concluded in <hi>Hamburg</hi> betwixt <hi>Monſieur d' Avo</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>John Salvius</hi> for the <hi>Swedes,</hi> a Treaty with promiſe, <hi>Not to ſend their Plenipotentiaries to any Meeting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Paſs-ports firſt had for their Miniſters, and for thoſe of their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates in the form required; that in the Treaty they ſhould proceed</hi> pari paſſu <hi>in the Intereſt of both the Crowns, concluding or breaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyntly; that in caſe of a long Truce, each ſhould remain in the poſſeſſion of what they held, and a Peace coming to be concluded, the one Crown
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:53750:229"/>
ſhould break for the others ſake, if the conditions to any of them were not by the contrary party punctually obſerved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The accident, which was moſt taken notice of, and rendred this year memorable, was the Birth in <hi>France</hi> of a <hi>Dolphin</hi> upon the 5. of <hi>September;</hi> who, after many years of fruitleſs Wedlock, given from Heaven to King <hi>Lewis</hi>'s piety, infinitely rejoyced that Kingdom, and ſeemed to ſerve as an Augure of future felicity; for the Arms managed hitherto with equality and a ballance, brought Fortune afterwards to incline to the favour of <hi>France.</hi>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICK OF VENICE. THE ELEVENTH BOOK.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>AMurath</hi> the Fourth ruled at this time the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in the prime of his age, and the height of ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nouriſhed by warlike ſpirits, and a capacity no leſs for Arms than Counſel. He had his mind fixed on the glory of his Anceſtors, ruminating on their Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, and ſtudying inceſſantly the Annals and famous Actions eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Soliman.</hi> The ſtrength of his body, the arrogance of his mind, the deſire of Empire, and the greedineſs of wealth, equal to that of blood, rendred him venerable to the Barbarians, amongſt whom Terrour poſſeſſes the place of Virtue. He caſt in his mind vaſt deſigns againſt Chriſtendom, and if at all times the concord of Chriſtian Princes uſes to be the Guardian of the Barbarians faith, <hi>Amurath</hi> conceived he might violate it without danger now, that he ſaw it torn into pieces, and weakned with unquenchable hatreds. But, for the preſent leaving them involved in their diſcords, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to ſhut the door, by which the <hi>Perſians</hi> might advance deep into ſeveral Provinces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. They had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, more by intelligence than force, <hi>Babylon,</hi> famous for its name, though it be but a heap of the reliques, and a ſhadow of its ancient ſtatelineſs, whilſt the <hi>Turks</hi> during the former years made an unſucceſsful War with the <hi>Polacks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amurath</hi> had once before attempted it with a formidable Army, but after ſome inconſiderable Conqueſt, unworthy of his preſence, and of ſo great preparations, the ſeaſon, the want of victuals, and
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:53750:230"/>
many other difficulties fighting againſt him, he returned to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> rather irritated than diſſwaded by the infelicity of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. In this year he returns with ſuch a diſpoſition of things, as ſhewed the power of a mighty Prince, and the wiſdom of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Captain; for to an Army, which was ſaid to exceed three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand men, not only Arms, Cannon, and Ammunition abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but Victuals, and every other kind of proviſions and things that might be needful, with ſuch order and method, that the multitude was not diſordered in their march, nor did the length of the way, or the extent of the vaſt deſarts waſte the multitude. So great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations at Land weakned the arming at Sea; whereupon, to the end that that might not remain unguarded and expoſed, he had enjoined the Pirates of <hi>Barbary</hi> to come with their Gallies into the <hi>Archipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lago,</hi> to join with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Squadrons. They were encreaſed to ſuch a degree, that they were now at laſt able to command the Sea, rather than commit ſpoil in it. For in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> the Chriſtian Fleets, by the War betwixt the Crowns, by factions, and by other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents being weakned, gave liberty to thoſe of <hi>Barbary</hi> to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then themſelves daily with Booties and with Slaves. They ſent ſixteen in obedience to the Turks, which, though they were called Galliots, exceeded nevertheleſs in the greatneſs of bulk, number of oars and men, the ordinary ſort of Gallies. They were divided into two Squadrons equally; thoſe of <hi>Tunis</hi> were commanded by <hi>Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſader;</hi> the other of <hi>Algiers</hi> by <hi>Ali Piccinino,</hi> a Renegado Chriſtian, who, when they were all joined, commanded in chief. They then ſet ſail towards the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> but having an eye always on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of prey, and hearing that the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet was in <hi>Candia,</hi> changing their courſe entred into the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> to make advantage of a ſudden courſe before they could be purſued and overtaken.</p>
            <p>The common opinion was, that they deſigned the rich ſpoil of the Chappel of <hi>Notre dame de Loretto,</hi> a place as good as open, defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by Religion, and the powerful arm of him, that by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful miracle tranſported ſo rare a pledge thither. Nevertheleſs, as they paſſed they bent towards <hi>Nicotra</hi> in <hi>Puglia,</hi> and landing there plundred the Town and Country there about, carrying away many Slaves, and amongſt thoſe ſome religious Women, whom they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently eſpouſed to their luſt. Thence paſſing to the other ſide of the Gulph they came to <hi>Cattaro,</hi> where one Veſſel fell into their hands, and their deſign was, after having plundred <hi>Liſſa,</hi> or ſome other Iſland of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to paſs over again towards <hi>la Marca,</hi> and there having pillaged <hi>Loretto,</hi> and all that ſhould have offered it ſelf to their rapine, with the ſame expedition going out of the Gulf, reſcued themſelves from puniſhment. Heaven firſt armed the winds and afterwards men againſt ſuch wicked intentions; ſo that having ſtayed there ſome days, and meeting with a deſperate ſtorm, they put into <hi>Valona,</hi> giving time to the places moſt expoſed to fortifie themſelves, and to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet to come up to them. It conſiſted of twenty eight Gallies, and two Galiaſſes, but not all in a body, eight of the nimbleſt being divided into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Poſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:53750:230"/>
               <hi>Marino Capello,</hi> or whether it were <hi>Anthony</hi> called <hi>Terzo,</hi> who as Proveditor commanded it, underſtanding, that there were <hi>Corſaires</hi> in the Gulph, parting from <hi>Candia</hi> with all ſpeed, arrives at <hi>Corfu,</hi> while they were yet in the Port of <hi>Vallona.</hi> This Town is ſubject to the <hi>Turks,</hi> and hath a Haven capable to receive a conſiderable Fleet with ſafety, by reaſon of the ſituation and a Caſtle, which being raiſed on a Hill, commands it. <hi>Capello</hi> nevertheleſs reſolves to go thither; for the Treaties with the <hi>Turks</hi> permitted the <hi>Venetians</hi> to purſue in all places, and chaſtiſe the Pirates, forbidding the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Commanders to receive them, or ſhew them any favour. He defies them, and plays upon them with his Cannon; but that doing little hurt at a diſtance, and the Forts by ſome ſhot declaring they would defend them, the <hi>Venetians</hi> withdrew; yet coming to an Anchor not far off to keep them beſieged, and fight them when they ſhould come out. This happened about the laſt of <hi>July,</hi> and on the third of the following month the Pirates attempted an eſcape, coming out in the morning with the advantage of the Sun, which ſhining full in face to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> permitted them not to diſcern the number of the Enemies Forces nor their order. However <hi>Capello</hi> weighing his Anchors, and incouraging his Captains, reſolves to attacque them, firſt playing on them with his Cannon, and afterwards endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to board them; but the <hi>Corſaires</hi> ſeeing that reſolution, changing their courſe, took Sanctuary again under the Fort, which played upon the <hi>Venetians</hi> in flank, and by a ſhot ſplit a Maſt, the pieces whereof brake the Arm of <hi>Lorenzo Marcello,</hi> Captain of the Galliaſſes. Other hurt there was not much, ſave that the <hi>Corſaires</hi> were put to repair in the Port five of their Gallies very ill handled by ſhot. <hi>Capello</hi> was obliged to return to his firſt Poſt, and they not daring to expoſe themſelves again to flight, or to a more cloſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, in hope that the wonted accidents of the Sea would oblige the <hi>Venetians</hi> to retire, were deceived by an unuſual and long calm, which gave opportunity for more than a month to keep them beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. During this time the Pirates did not only new-fit their Ships, but ordered their defence; for, fearing leſt the Slaves coming to mutiny, might carry away the Gallies, they diſbarked them, ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them in a Fort and within certain Trenches, by which they were a protection to the Gallies, beſides the countenance of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, into which the Commanders, corrupted by preſents, gave the Pirates not only acceſs, but permitted them the cuſtody and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of it. The Chiefs of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet were in this interim in a difficult conſultation; for the inſult done by theſe <hi>Barbary</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates being not to be endured, their chaſtiſement ſeemed no leſs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable than juſt, leſt, if they ſhould this time go ſcot-free, and through impunity and ſtrength increaſe their inſolence, the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would be no more reſpected, the Sea ſecure, Navigation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and the Iſlands and Provinces preſerved; but all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would quickly become ſenſible of theſe aſſaults, and Piracy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turned into War, there would be a neceſſity to ſubdue them as Enemies, that might at preſent be puniſhed as Pirates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="448" facs="tcp:53750:231"/>On the other ſide there appeared difficulties in the undertaking, above all the reſpect to a Fort and Haven of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> which though unjuſtly and contrary to the Peace it protected them, yet the Pirates, rather ſeeking the occaſions than the cauſes of War, might poſſibly greedily embrace this opportunity to execute their perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deſigns againſt Chriſtendom. The prudence of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders fluctuating amidſt theſe weighty conſiderations, was from ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity induced to more reſolute courſes; for the Pirates having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertized <hi>Bechir,</hi> Captain <hi>Baſſa</hi> of the Sea, by expreſs Meſſengers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by Land, of the danger in which they were, implored ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, remonſtrating to him, how much the honour of their common Maſter would be undervalued, and his ſervice injured, if they ſhould be loſt in a Haven and under a Fortreſs, which bore the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Standard, and that that Squadron ſhould be ruined, which without charge to the Grand Signor ſerved for a troubleſom exerciſe to the Chriſtians, and a ſeaſonable ſtrengthening to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chir</hi> upon this advice and by ſuch reaſons inſtigated, moves with twenty two Gallies and two great Hulks, beſides ſome other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, to come towards the Gulph, to favour the coming forth of the <hi>Corſaires;</hi> upon knowledge whereof, <hi>Capello</hi> putting ſpeedily to a conſult, what was fit to be done, it was reſolved to prevent being catcht betwixt two Fleets, and forced either to a diſhonourable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat or to a diſadvantagious Ingagement, which at laſt with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy beginning might break forth into a War. There was no other way to fight and overcome the Pirates but by entring into the Port, and that courſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> pitched upon, doubtful never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs whether it were more expedient to burn thoſe Ships, or bring them away. But of that the reſolution being put off till they ſhould ſee the ſucceſs, the Fleet on the 7. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> in the morning was ranged into a Half-moon, on the points whereof were placed the two Galliaſſes to cover the leſſer Gallies from the ſhot of the Fort, and ſo entred couragiouſly into the Haven, where the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaires,</hi> aſtoniſhed at ſo great boldneſs, and thoſe thereupon who had the guard of the Ships, flying in confuſion to Land, they made their defence only with Cannon and Muſkets from the Fort and from the Trenches.</p>
            <p>The Fort was not ſparing of its Cannon; but the two Galliaſſes halling themſelves under the Wall, and with greater Pieces, ſome ſhot whereof fell particularly into the Church to the great reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Turks,</hi> reſtraining its Battery, covered the Gallies in ſuch ſort, that they advanced under the Bolſprits of the Enemy. There finding them empty, ſome Mariners of <hi>Peraſto,</hi> incenſed at the remembrance of the ſpoils done to their Country not long before by theſe very Pirates, leaping into the water, cut the Cables and the Chains, which tying the Ships one to another, made them faſt to the ſhore. So all the ſixteen being taken and towed away with inceſſant ſhooting on both ſides, but little ſhedding of blood on the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſide of perſons of account, <hi>Giovanni Minotto</hi> only, a Maſters Mate, being hurt with a Muſket, they carried them to <hi>Corfu</hi> in great
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:53750:231"/>
Triumph. There was found upon theſe Gallies Cannon, Arms, and Proviſions; over and above all, the Furniture belonging to the Ships themſelves and ſome booty which was preſently divided. The Hulls of the Gallies, to the end both the <hi>Corſaires</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> might loſe the hopes of ever having them again, were afterwards all ſunk for the making of the Mole at <hi>Corſu,</hi> except the Admiral of <hi>Algier,</hi> which was ſent to <hi>Venice</hi> to be kept in the Arſenal as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, and another which was known to belong to a great Man of the <hi>Turks,</hi> carried away formerly into <hi>Barbary</hi> by one <hi>Cicale</hi> a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. The gallantry of the action was univerſally magnified, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and by the Subjects of the Church, who acknowledged themſelves preſerved from cruel miſchiefs. The news coming to <hi>Venice</hi> by the Galley of <hi>Martin Molino,</hi> Maſter of it, the Miniſters, Reſidents of Princes, came to congratulate, and the Pope ſent an expreſs Brief, commemorating the glorious enterpriſes of the Republick for the maintenance of the Faith, and numbred this preſent action amongſt the moſt famous and advantagious to Chriſtendom, offering his Forces, whatever ſhould happen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p>The Nuntio, as the occaſion required, was admitted to preſent it at an Audience, and the Senate correſponded in giving thanks. Greater ſigns of joy were not publickly permitted in <hi>Venice,</hi> than to give God thanks by the Sacrifice of a ſolemn Maſs. <hi>Molino</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a Chain of Gold, <hi>Capello</hi> honoured with the dignity of a Counſellor, and <hi>Marcello</hi> with that of Cenſor, and a thankful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation given to the reſt; the Senate remained in ſuſpence, what reſentments and reſolutions the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Miniſters were to ſhew up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. Ordering therefore an exact Watch every where in the Iſlands and on the Borders, they communicated to the Chriſtian Princes the ſucceſs, ſhewing in this occaſion alſo to have practiſed their ancient cuſtom, to prefer honour and common ſafety before dangers and their own intereſt.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> mens minds ſeemed in truth variouſly affected; for upon the firſt report of the Pirates being beſieged in the Port, the <hi>Turks</hi> had made a ſhew to be ſomewhat ſenſible of it; but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Sea would either open a way for them to eſcape, or would hinder the <hi>Venetians</hi> longer ſtay there; <hi>Muſſe Baſſa,</hi> who in the Kings abſence governed in quality of <hi>Caimecan,</hi> that is, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> made himſelf ignorant of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, not ſo much out of a dexterity, as becauſe Forces being far off, and the King ingaged againſt a powerful Enemy, he thought it not fit for him with complaints and jealouſies to provoke him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by againſt others. But when the certainty came of all that had happened, with the carrying away of the Gallies, artifice being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by Nature and Barbarity, he brake out into exceſs of anger. The whole fact coming afterwards to be publiſhed, the principal Miniſters and all ſorts of perſons were moved at it, exaſperating the violation of the Port, of the Fortreſs, and of the Church, beſides the carrying away of the Ships appointed for the <hi>Grand Signors</hi> ſervice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="450" facs="tcp:53750:232"/>There happened a while after a commotion amongſt the <hi>Corſaires,</hi> ſome of which, and in particular the Son of <hi>Piccinino</hi> in a mournful ſemblance and a pitiful habit, as is the cuſtom of that Nation, with tears and crys, filled with lamentations the <hi>Divan</hi> and the principal houſes of the great men, deſcribing the inſult, deploring the loſs of the Gallies, the diſperſing of the Slaves, and reckoning amongſt the loſſes, the loſt hopes by roving at Sea to plunder and devour the Wealth of the Chriſtians. The Miniſters hereupon greatly moved, arrogantly required of the <hi>Bailo</hi> the reſtitutions of the Ships; but he, (it was that <hi>Luigi Contarini</hi> Cavalier, who had grown old in the experiences of almoſt all the Courts of <hi>Europe</hi>) with as much calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and conſtancy denied it, and brought his reaſons, interpoſing time to fury, and alſo with dexterity ſhewing, <hi>The right to puniſh him that dare come into another mans houſe to ſteal. He alledged the Articles and Agreements, attributing the blame of the evil that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the</hi> Turkiſh <hi>Commanders, that had, contrary to the Peace, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Pirates protection, and therefore he rather demanded, that they might be exemplarily puniſhed as guilty, through an inſatiable covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of prey, and in contempt of the Orders of</hi> Amurath, <hi>to have gone out of their way, and violated the Dominion of a Prince in friendſhip with the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Port.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In effect, minds being a little quieted, many within a while dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted their imprudence and temerity; nay at <hi>Algier, Ali Piccinino</hi> was condemned, as having gone beyond his Commiſſion, if he ſhould fall into the power of that Government, to loſe his head. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of the other Chriſtian Princes preſented a Writing of one and the ſame tenour to the <hi>Caimecan,</hi> inveighing bitterly againſt theſe very <hi>Corſaires</hi> for the miſchiefs received by every of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which frequented the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Havens, though in perfect friendſhip with the Port; whereupon approving as juſt the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment received, they appeared to intereſt themſelves in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining what the <hi>Venetians</hi> had done. It ſeemed thereupon, that the accident was communicated to the King with ſome ſort of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. But with ſo much the more bitterneſs did the <hi>Sultana</hi>-Mother and the other Women of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> exclaim againſt it; for, either corrupted with gifts by the <hi>Corſaires,</hi> or longing, that, to exerciſe their authority nearer hand, and enjoy their wonted plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, he might quickly be reſtored to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> they all labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, abandoning the remote undertaking of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he would imploy his Arms on this ſide againſt Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amurath</hi> was at this time come to the Frontiers of <hi>Perſia,</hi> where, <hi>Bairan</hi> the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> dying, a man of a moderate ſpirit and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally averſe from complaints, he had ſubſtituted in his place <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemet, Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Diarbechir,</hi> one more lofty and unquiet. He agreed better with the inclinations of the King, rendred by his ſeverities terrible to his Miniſters and to all; for under the ſhew of Military Diſcipline he vented without diſtinction his cruelties for the lighteſt offences, executing ſometimes with his own hands hideous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He particularly could not endure the ſmoke or ſmell of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:53750:232"/>
Tobacco ſo much uſed by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and having forbid it, he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with death him that durſt uſe it. Always entertaining himſelf either with ſuſpicions or tortures, ſometimes <hi>incognito</hi> and by night he went into the Camp, and walked betwixt the Circles and the Tents, obſerving what was ſaid and done, and then on a ſudden puniſhing, with atrocity of torments, ſometimes one ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another. Death, with the blow of a Sword, from the hand of the common Hangman ſeemed to him too gentle and merciful. He rather, to the barbarous manner of the <hi>Turks,</hi> of the <hi>Gancio,</hi> the <hi>Palo,</hi> and <hi>Fleaing,</hi> often added new inventions of puniſhments. However all this ſerved him for reſpect with his own, and terrour to his Enemies.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt, that had he not been ſo far ingaged againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> what for the buſineſs of <hi>Vallona,</hi> and the inſtigation of the Sultaneſs, he would have returned to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Arms againſt the <hi>Venetians.</hi> But being not ſo ſoon able to diſ-intangle himſelf there, by an expreſs diſpatch he commands, that for the preſent the <hi>Bailo</hi> ſhould be put in arreſt; that the <hi>Corſaires</hi> ſhould in ſome meaſure be recompenſed with ten Gallies of his own; that, to preſerve the remainder of the Slaves, they ſhould be convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to go forth in the Spring together with the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Fleet: In his abſence nothing elſe was to be altered, proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſevere threatnings upon the heads of the Miniſters, whom he ſuſpected of venality, not to hearken to any propoſition, that contained not the effectual reſtitution of the Gallies carried away. So that, will and violence ſerving the <hi>Turks</hi> for juſt and right, the Order did no ſooner arrive, but the <hi>Caimecan</hi> ſending for the <hi>Bailo,</hi> ſhewing a viſible trouble to be the unjuſt Miniſter of a moſt unjuſt command, intimates to him his impriſonment, keeping him all night in the houſe of his <hi>Checaia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was it to any purpoſe, that the <hi>Bailo</hi> with great conſtancy did with his great reaſons mingle complaints, for the violence done to common right, and the breach of faith; nor, that the other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Princes greatly offended, did make effectual inſtances about it: For <hi>Muſſa,</hi> confeſſing the proceeding unjuſt, but excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the danger of his head, cauſed him to be brought into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle houſe of <hi>Galata,</hi> keeping him there with Guards, and placed ſome at the <hi>Bailo</hi>'s ordinary place of Reſidence, but leaving the Family in liberty, and permitting him viſits of converſation and buſineſs. The Ships of the Nation being at the ſame time ſtopped, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a few days releaſed, the Turks having conſidered, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of Commerce and a reciprocal arreſt tended equally to their own damage. As to the <hi>Corſaires,</hi> the promiſe of ten Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies was not performed; for doubting, leſt, if the Slaves were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the King ſhould make uſe of them for his own Gallies, they avoided it with ſeveral pretexts, and had news of thirty Ships of <hi>Barbary</hi> in the <hi>Archipelago</hi> come expreſs to fetch them away, with deſign to winter in thoſe Seas, and offer in the Spring to join with the <hi>Turks</hi> againſt the <hi>Republick.</hi> But they, perceiving
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:53750:233"/>
the <hi>Corſaires</hi> already too powerful, and fearing leſt they ſhould ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſly provoke in that conjuncture the Chriſtian Nations, or break off all Commerce with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> States, diſcharged them. The Miniſters of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> knowing that the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſunk the Gallies which were taken, to avoid troubleſom inſtances for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring them, inſolently required of the <hi>Bailo,</hi> that as many of their own might be delivered to them, otherwiſe threatning War.</p>
            <p>The Senate, in order to it, by Heralds of War received the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of the arreſt of the <hi>Bailo,</hi> together with the ſame demands; but conſtant not to conſent to any thing of prejudice or indignity, reſolved rather to expoſe themſelves to any how unfortunate ſoever ingagement. They communicated to the Chriſtian Princes the fury of <hi>Amurath,</hi> the arreſt of the <hi>Bailo,</hi> the arrogant demands of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and their own reſolves, to the end that great and univerſal dangers impending, they might equally diſpoſe their Forces for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, and their minds for Peace; it ſeeming both reaſonable and of neceſſity, that againſt the common Enemy there ſhould be an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even of the greateſt Enemies. The reſentment was every where not inferiour to the approbation. Yet ſome offered only to mediate, and others excuſed themſelves upon the conjuncture.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> offered their Forces; but theſe appearing to be weak, and thoſe diſtracted, the Republick was given to underſtand, that they could not for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent make any certain ſtate, but of their own ſtrength. It being a ſafe counſel never to deſpiſe the fame and threats of the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Senate for that cauſe was willing to govern it ſelf with ſuch prudence, that, for their own ſecurity making advantage of the abſence of <hi>Amurath</hi> and of time, the evils by ſuperfluous jealouſies might not be haſtened, or that Prince diverted from his preſent ingagements. Willing then not to provoke him, nor leave him cauſe of offence, as proviſions were not omitted, ſo they were not greatly divulged or ſpeeded. Command was given to the Iſlands, and in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> that all ſhould be in a readineſs for the occaſions; that in <hi>Candia</hi> ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Gallies ſhould be effectually armed; that to the Galliaſſes two ſhould be added, the one commanded by <hi>Anthonio Piſari,</hi> who had the command of them all; the other by <hi>Sebaſtian Veniero.</hi> In the <hi>Arſenal</hi> every thing for a greater arming was diſpoſed into an order, and the Maritime places were provided with recruits of Foot and Horſe. The cuſtody of <hi>Cattaro</hi> was committed to <hi>Giovanni Paulo Gradenigo,</hi> and to <hi>Marino Molino</hi> that of <hi>Novegradi,</hi> as Prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors extraordinary. Not omitting amidſt the orders for defence, the more ſecure way of Treaty, the Senate wrote Letters to <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath,</hi> and to the Grand Viſier, aggravating the aſſault and boldneſs of the Pirates, juſtifying with expediency and the capitulations their chaſtiſement, and profeſſing a ſincere and conſtant will not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the ancient friendſhip with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. But the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking in <hi>Aſia,</hi> upon which the counſels and reſolutions of the <hi>Turks</hi> were chiefly to depend, proceeded with ſteps faſter than was ſuppoſed; for, <hi>Amurath</hi> appearing no ſooner in the Confines of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
               <pb n="453" facs="tcp:53750:233"/>
but the Town of <hi>Revan,</hi> weakly guarded, was rendred to him.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, by inſtigation of the <hi>Turks, Osbeck</hi> a <hi>Tartar,</hi> and the Grand <hi>Mogor</hi> took Arms againſt the <hi>Perſians;</hi> from whence it became ſo much the more eaſie for <hi>Amurath</hi> to incamp himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Walls of <hi>Babylon,</hi> a City on the Banks of <hi>Tigris,</hi> of a moſt vaſt circuit, and fortified by the <hi>Perſians</hi> with three ditches and three incloſures of wall, but without that order and art, which in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age renders places invincible, even of a much leſs circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. <hi>Emir Fatta</hi> was Governour, with a Garriſon of little leſs than thirty thouſand Souldiers. Nevertheleſs, they ſufficed not to hinder <hi>Amurath,</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> from encamping there; and he having advertiſement, that the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> with ſixty thouſand Horſe was on his march to attempt the relief, prevented him, ſending a great number of his men to take poſſeſſion of the avenues and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages. On the other ſide over-running the Country with many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and with good Guards keeping the ways ſecure and open for his Victuals, he diverted from his Camp that neceſſity which he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much more than the Enemy. Diſtributing afterwards three at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques, with as many Batteries, againſt the Town, he gave the command of one to the Grand Viſier; aſſigns another to <hi>Muſtafa;</hi> and committed the third to <hi>Deli <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King had a mind with his own hand to give fire to the firſt Cannon, and with a fierce ſtoutneſs aſſiſted, and was preſent eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where giving orders, rewarding and puniſhing with a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act vigilance. To theſe beginnings the beſieged making no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but only with Cannon, endeavouring to hinder their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and ruine their works; the <hi>Turks,</hi> covered with Trenches, were able to advance to the firſt Ditch. And then the <hi>Perſians</hi> made a ſally, with great numbers and much fury, penetrating into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Trenches, where they cut to pieces ſix thouſand <hi>Janiſſaries,</hi> and would have done greater miſchief, if <hi>Amurath,</hi> haſted thither with the Chiefs, drawing with him the flower of the Army, and the greater part of the Souldiers, had not with as much violence repulſed them. It is the cuſtom of the <hi>Turks</hi> in Sieges to overcome Art, and conquer Nature with fatigue and induſtry; for prevailing in numbers and ſtrength of bodies they weary out the defenders with indefatigable pains, win places with works and miraculous la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and, if other means fail, they uſe to make Bridges, fill up Ditches, and raiſe Engines with the very bodies of the ſlain. In this Siege they undertook to fill up a very great Ditch, and effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it after twenty three days of continual labour, and many oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the beſieged; by the benefit whereof making a breach of fifty paces in the Wall, they made way to make themſelves Maſters of the firſt incloſure. Two others remained, probably of greater difficulty, ſo that it was of neceſſity, for filling up another Ditch, to employ great endeavours; and raiſing a great Cat with many Cannons on it, commanding the Wall, they attempted to diſlodge the defenders; but they oppoſed another not inferiour in height, and with an equal number of Cannon ſilenced the Battery of the
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:53750:234"/>
               <hi>Turks.</hi> They then, by ways made under ground penetrating into the Ditch, made nothing of the oppoſition of their Enemy, taking out of the way all that, which of earth or otherwiſe they had brought to hinder them. But the <hi>Turks,</hi> not to be wearied out, with great bodies of Palm Trees, with which the Country abounds, raiſed the Ditch equal to the Earth.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Amurath,</hi> vexed that blood was ſpilt ſo ſlowly, reſolves to give a general aſſault, and with one fury alone force both the Ramparts. Making then choice of the day, on which Chriſtians ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Nativity of our Lord, and was the fortieth of the Siege, he orders the Town to be aſſaulted on both ſides. Himſelf in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had a mind to lead on the Troops, and was not eaſily diverted from it by the chief Baſſa's, promiſing ſolemnly to expoſe themſelves, and ſacrifice their own lives, ſo he would ſpare himſelf. The Grand Viſier took the charge of one ſide, and <hi>Muſtafa</hi> of the other. The Viſier, having given proof of all poſſible force in vain, was killed upon a heap of dead bodies. The other ſeeing almoſt all his men dead about him, taking in his hand in a fury one of the Royal Standards, climbs up the wall, and plants it there. The Souldiers followed with great boldneſs, and killing ſome of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> they entred the City, meeting with no other difficulty to make themſelves way in ſeveral places; for the defenders, overcome in one, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all. The <hi>Turks</hi> purſuing entred alſo the third incloſure, with the cruelty which not only Nature and the Victory ſuggeſted, but fury and blood alſo. In the City were killed without diſtinction the armed and the unarmed, the Inhabitants as well as the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, preſerving only alive the <hi>Perſian</hi> Governour, with a few others, to ſatisfie the pride of <hi>Amurath,</hi> and adorn the Triumph. In the Aſſault, which laſted a great while, the fight being obſtinate and with much valour, with Sable in hand thirty thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> were ſlain, and more than ten thouſand hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Amurath</hi> having his mind ſweetned with the flatteries of glory, and ſo noble a Conqueſt, ſuffered it to be carried away with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted ſcene of clemency, ordering that the ſlaughter ſhould ceaſe, and the Inhabitants be pardoned as to life; when <hi>Muſtafa,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately taken, as the reward of his courage, into the place of Grand Viſier, remonſtrating to him how, much danger from commiſeration towards a people ſo numerous and an Enemy might be expected, whilſt, when the Army was retired, the Garriſon might at ſome time or other be overpowered, he gave way that twenty four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men more ſhould be ſlain. Thus was <hi>Babylon</hi> loſt, loſing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that boaſt, which ſome gave it, never to have been taken by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault. <hi>Amurath</hi> made his Entry over the bodies yet warm, of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſlain, and amidſt their blood, almoſt reeking, barbarouſly rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to triumph over a City formerly ſo famous and ſtately. The pillage laſted three days, and the King commanded, that ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand bodies ſhould remain unburied, that a <hi>Perſian</hi> Ambaſſador, whom he expected, might be terrified at the horrible ſpectacle of ſo great a ſlaughter. Thus pride induces barbarous Princes to ſhew

               <p>In <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with all ſorts of jollity for twenty days was the Victory ſolemnized; after which it ſeemed not to be at all doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that <hi>Amurath,</hi> from ſo happy ſucceſs elated in his mind and confidence, would think of adding to his <hi>Perſian</hi> Triumphs, thoſe alſo which the diſunion of Chriſtendom promiſed him. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of ſo great faſte arrived to him the Letters of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> to which, with an expreſs Currier (the <hi>Turks</hi> call him <hi>Olaccho</hi>) he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers; but not making the leaſt mention of the arreſt of the <hi>Bailo,</hi> if he were a Conquerour of <hi>Aſia,</hi> he no leſs threatned <hi>Europe.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through ambition or ſcorn, he touched not a word of an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment. Diverſity of enterpriſes offered themſelves continually to his thoughts; for, the inceſſant Piracies of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> in the Black Sea provoked him againſt <hi>Poland,</hi> and the diſcords of <hi>Germany</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured him towards <hi>Hungary;</hi> beſides an old deſign to diſpoſſeſs the Prince of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and put another in his place of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence with him. Under pretext to communicate to the Emperour the Conqueſt of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he ſends to him <hi>Indan Aga Capigi Baſſi,</hi> but in effect to ſpie the ſtate of thoſe Affa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rs, and underſtand how they ſtood. Certain it is, that which way ſoever he had turned that fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious torrent, he would have overwhelmed and carried every thing by force. In this interim he commands, Commerce ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden with the Territories of the Republick, and their Ships and Merchandiſe to be ſequeſtred, and that a good number of Gallies ſhould be built in the Black Sea, ordering all ſorts of proviſion for a Naval Army, and in particular a vaſt quantity of Biſquet. To all this was the <hi>Caimecan</hi> obliged to furniſh what was needful with unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant diligence, and fearing the diſpleaſure of the King, having no ready money in the Treaſury, he disburſed it of his own.</p>
               <p>For the greater credit upon ſo great Naval preparations, <hi>Amurath</hi> nominates for Captain <hi>Baſſa</hi> his Favourite <hi>Salitar,</hi> believing with his name, which was moſt acceptable to him, he ſhould induce the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery to follow him more willingly at Sea. Nor could the War of <hi>Perſia</hi> detain him any longer there; for that King advancing, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after the taking of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with forty thouſand Horſe, had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to reap ſome of thoſe advantages, which in new Conqueſts the negligence of the Conquerours, either diſbanded to plunder, or lead away with the Feſtivals, or negligent in their Watch, is wont ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to offer. But <hi>Amurath,</hi> watchful over all, ſends againſt him ten thouſand <hi>Janiſſaries</hi> with forty thouſand Horſe, and there was like to have been a Battel, if the exceſſive ſwelling of a River, which ran betwixt them, had not hindred the Encounter. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> hereupon thought fit to retire, and, applying to the thoughts of Peace, being, beſides Foreign diſtractions, moleſted with ſeditions at
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:53750:235"/>
home, he ſends an Ambaſſadour to <hi>Amurath,</hi> who received him in <hi>Babylon</hi> with that horrid Ceremony before mentioned. The anſwer to the Propoſitions of Peace was not leſs haughty, declaring, that he would entirely deſolate that Kingdom, if he did not give up to him all that, which in other times had been poſſeſſed by the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor did the <hi>Mogor</hi> ſpeak of milder Conditions, demanding the Province of <hi>Candahar,</hi> for which he made War. The <hi>Perſian</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, inferiour in ſtrength, went on fencing in the Treaty for the gaining of time, which happened fitly to his advantage; becauſe <hi>Amurath</hi> was forced to draw further off thoſe Confines. God, who above all hates the pride of men, uſes to puniſh it with the ſelf ſame inſtruments of their vanity. And that was ſeen in <hi>Babylon,</hi> where thoſe unburied Carcaſſes cauſed ſuch a terrible plague, that the Air being infected, men periſhed in infinite numbers. <hi>Amurath</hi> gone, and the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> left on the Borders, and a great Garriſon in the City, comes to <hi>Diarbechir</hi> to paſs into <hi>Europe.</hi> According to his motion the <hi>Venetians</hi> haſtened alſo their proviſions and the care of their defence. About the end of the year paſt, the Pope congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Victory, had voluntarily ſent the Republick the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Tithes upon the Clergy, which was wont to be renewed every nine years.</p>

But the Mediation being common to them both, there was a neceſſity that the Miniſters of both ſhould confer together. But in what Method that might be adequate to the neceſſity, could that be practiſed, ſince the affections of the Princes ſeemed ſo much diſunited amongst themſelves? That the Mediators would neglect their duties, if themſelves at diſcord and divided, did not perſwade others to Peace with authority and with examples. That the projects to be made uſe of in the Courts ought to be ripened at</hi> Rome; <hi>there ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed the defence and motions againſt the common Enemy. That the Pope deſired hereupon the counſels of the Republick, no leſs than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of the</hi> Turks <hi>proceedings, to direct the reſolutions of what ought to be done. Nor amidſt ſo many cares were to be omitted appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to</hi> Italy, <hi>reduced to the point of a grand Criſis by the affairs of</hi> Piedmont, <hi>where the inward affections of that Family made ſport for Strangers. What remained now entire in</hi> Italy <hi>and faithful to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, if the Pope and the Republick at leaſt ſhould not conſpire with unanimity and counſel to preſerve the one with Negotiations of Peace, and the other with the junction of Arms? The Senate therefore was from the conjuncture of the times, the univerſal neceſſity, and the deſire of the Pope, invited to ſend Miniſters to him, to the end, that intereſts and opinions being made common, the remedy of the preſent evils might be fully conſidered.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe motives the <hi>Venetians</hi> reſolved to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> an

Ambaſſadour Extraordinary with expreſs charge, that keeping only to that which concerned the Cauſe of the <hi>Turks</hi> and the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Peace of Chriſtendom, he ſhould abſtain from whatſoever buſineſs, that might tend to the proper intereſts of the Republick, which, in regard of thoſe that were common, it was willing at preſent to lay aſide and ſuſpend. <hi>Giovanni Nani,</hi> Procurator of St. <hi>Marco,</hi> was made choice of, to the end that by that natural dexterity he had, and conſummated experience, gained in the moſt weighty imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Republick, he might promote affairs of that great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. He was received by the Pope with joy and ſingular te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of honour; but <hi>Frederick,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Cornaro,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Venice,</hi> being his Fore-runner, ſent (as is the obligation of Cuſtom) in imitation of the Apoſtles, induces <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> to cancel the Inſcription placed by him under the Memorial of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the Third. But to reſtore that which was anciently there, he would not, tacite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaving it to the conſideration of his Succeſſor, ſince he aboliſhed that whereof himſelf had been Author. The Senate, eſteeming this, for ſo much as it was the firſt ſtep, neceſſary for the finiſhing of the work, omitted not to expreſs it ſelf, that nothing elſe could content it but the renewing of the former <hi>Elogium.</hi> Upon this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture of correſpondence with <hi>Rome,</hi> the Senate aſſents alſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the Bulls for divers Prelates, upon whom, during the paſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, Biſhopricks and other Benefices of the Church had been conferred, and a certain difficulty about the uſual propoſing of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks being moved in the Conſiſtory, becauſe it was the deſire of the Senate, that that Function ſhould be performed by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals <hi>Venetians,</hi> of which <hi>Cornaro</hi> alone was then in Court, it was as an act of confidence agreed, that together with the National, the Cardinals alſo of the Palace, Brother and Nephew of the Pope himſelf, ſhould do it.</p>
               <p>But as to the affairs moſt important, the Ambaſſadour demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> what the danger was which impended from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Arms. <hi>That</hi> Babylon <hi>was taken, and therefore in</hi> Perſia <hi>the War at an end, or Peace very near. It was not to be doubted, but that to</hi> Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath, <hi>puffed up and elated in his mind, ambition and power would ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt new deſigns and bold attempts. The long inteſtine diſcords of the Princes had theſe many years ſerved for paſtime to the</hi> Barbarians, <hi>who carefully obſerve the conjunctures, by aſſaulting the weakeſt to make way to invade the more powerful. War was ſcattered in</hi> Italy, <hi>and in every other part; Chriſtendom appeared all bathed in blood, nor were other reports heard of, but thoſe of deadly Battels and lamentable Sieges. Why ſhould ſo great ſlaughters be endured for unprofitable Conqueſts, nay for great damages, if we will compare them to the progreſs which the common Enemy promiſes himſelf? That Chriſtendom can ſave it ſelf from this preſent ſhipwrack but by Peace alone. That it was</hi> Urbans <hi>duty to apply the prayers, and ingage the Authority of a common Father and a Prince, to pacifie his Sons and unite them againſt the Power of the</hi> Barbarians. <hi>That it was his office to calm the World, appeaſe the Kings, pacifie the Princes, quiet diſturbances, and compoſe the people.
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:53750:236"/>
The Republick would not ſpare pains and endeavours to ſecond thoſe pious intentions and his moſt prudent judgment. She ſaw her ſelf threatned by the unjuſt rage of the</hi> Turks, <hi>but what was her Country but the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works of others? She maintained with a long Frontier the Guard of the Confines of</hi> Italy <hi>and the violence of a furious Torrent. If ſhe ſhould yield to neceſſity, or fall under force, what would become of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of</hi> Sicily <hi>and</hi> Naples, <hi>nay the State of the Pope himſelf? This Country, the Guardian of Religion, the Seat of Liberty and Honour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be invaded by the</hi> Turks <hi>in one part but it will be oppreſſed all over. Their dreadful Arms are to be compared to that poyſon, which by one ſole touch creeps irreſiſtably over the whole body. That the Senate for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit promiſes a conſtancy in maintaining the War equal to the Generoſity of provoking it. The proud pretenſions of the</hi> Turks <hi>had for their aim to extort from the Republick Ships and Gallies, to offend Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom with the very inſtruments of their own defence. In caſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, War enſued; of granting, the power and ſtrength of the Enemy was increaſed, who not content with the uſurping of ſo many ſpoils, lies in wait for the laſt breath of languiſhing Chriſtendom. That the Republick had given an abſolute denial to their demands, yet knew their Forces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, and by conſequence the danger great: Nevertheleſs put their Arms in order, prepared for reſiſtance, with a firm hope, that that War being from God, and the cauſe undivided betwixt the Church and the Republick, bleſſings from Heaven would abound, nor would warlike aſſiſtances be wanting, in particular that of the Vicar of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Pope heard all with grave reflections; diſcourſed of many things; and although more difficult to reſolve and put them in effect, nevertheleſs affirmed, that urgency coming upon them, he would not ſuffer his endeavours and forces to be wanting. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he permitted the Levy of three or four thouſand men in his Country, and to promote more vigorouſly the Mediation of Peace betwixt the Princes, he ſent Extraordinary Nuntio's to the Courts with vehement intreaties and effectual conſiderations to bring them to ſome Conditions of Peace, and, if that ſhould be found too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and long, to a Truce, or at leaſt to a ſuſpenſion of Arms by Sea, by tranſmitting their powers to <hi>Rome,</hi> to the end, that under the eye and direction of the Pope the Treaty might with as much care, as the neceſſity required, be brought to perfection. The Ambaſſadours of the Republick cooperated in the ſame, the interpoſition of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> proving faint and not acceptable. For a pretext of particular diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſerved the diſtaſte, which was pretended by the Emperour, by <hi>France,</hi> and by <hi>Spain;</hi> for there being named in the promotion of Cardinals by the Emperour the Prince <hi>Rinaldo d'Eſté,</hi> and by one of the Crowns <hi>Giulio Mazarini,</hi> and by the other the Abbot <hi>Peretti,</hi> the Pope denying to comply with the inſtances, and, to cover the little inclination he had towards thoſe perſons, alledging that they were not National, deferred the promotion, though there were many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vacant.</p>
               <p>The Crowns herewith not at all content, inſiſted on the Nomination with ſo much heat, that being at variance in all elſe, they agreed only
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:53750:236"/>
in this, to force the will of the Pope; and paſſing from intreaties to proteſts and threatnings, gave out, they would forbid their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to accept of that Dignity, as often as the nominated ſhould not be comprehended. The <hi>French</hi> in particular preſſed for <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who, beſides what he had negotiated in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> had in his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Nunciature of <hi>France</hi> ſo gained the favour of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and had declared himſelf ſo partial for that Crown, that, having drawn the Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> to the dependence upon it, he not only paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Rome</hi> for the moſt confident Miniſter of <hi>France,</hi> but being called to <hi>Paris,</hi> was declared Plenipotentiary at the Meeting for Peace, not without the diſguſt and murmuring of ſome of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that for the Purple and weightieſt Imployments Strangers were preferred, as if Merit and Capacity were wanting in ſo many perſons of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>To exaſperate minds the more, there happened afterwards other leſſer accidents, which yet in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> take the place of greater matters; for the Maſter of the Horſe of the Mareſhal <hi>d'Eſtré,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> being out-lawed for having taken away out of the hands of the Serjeants a Friend of his, was killed in the Country, while he was yet in his ſervice, and his head publickly expoſed in <hi>Rome.</hi> Whereupon the Ambaſſadour taking himſelf to be ſlighted, intermitted going to Audiences, from whence came, that in <hi>France</hi> alſo they were denied to <hi>Monſieur Scotti,</hi> Nuntio Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, with much rigour and ſeverity. This diſguſt was at laſt compoſed with the puniſhing ſome Officers, and with the offices of reſpect and eſteem, which the Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> paſſed with the Ambaſſadour in his own houſe, going thither to viſit his Wife. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, upon the old diffidences with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſowed new diſcontents; ſo that the Ambaſſadour, Marqueſs <hi>di Caſtel Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derigo,</hi> ſuſpended in like manner the Audiences with <hi>Barberino,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, he being the Cardinal Protector of the Religion of the <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans,</hi> had, by the Authority of the Pope, aſſumed to the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat a Brother that had not the Royal approbation; and the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was ſo much the more increaſed, by how much the ſame Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, the night of the Nativity, cauſed in <hi>Rome</hi> faſt by a Church to be arreſted the Prince of <hi>Sans,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Dorefici,</hi> a <hi>Neopolitan,</hi> accuſed to frame with the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> (not without the knowledge of the <hi>Barberins</hi>) concerts againſt that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and being ſent to the Vice-King had his head publickly cut off.</p>
               <p>From all this the Negotiation of Peace grew cool, beſides that through the difficulty of the Paſs-ports the meeting of the Aſſembly was prolonged; and as for the general Truce, which was to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> though their Confederates of contrary Religion could not come thither, ſhewed themſelves ready to ſend their powers; conſcious nevertheleſs, that ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition would be adhorred by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as afterward happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, King <hi>Philip</hi> declaring himſelf, that he could not open his mind in confidence to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> whilſt one of the Cardinal Nephews ſhewed
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:53750:237"/>
himſelf ſo partial to <hi>France.</hi> The Miſſion then of Extraordinary Nuntios, rendred unprofitable by the difficulty, and little pleaſing by reaſon of the diſguſts, was of no other uſe but to give a change in <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Madrid</hi> to thoſe in Ordinary. The weight of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation falling almoſt wholly upon the Ambaſſadours of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Truce was by them point blank propoſed in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>Spain,</hi> but was encountred with the wonted diſagreements; for <hi>Richelieu</hi> deſired it for eight or ten years, and that every one ſhould remain in poſſeſſion of what he was ſeized; and <hi>Olivares</hi> pretended it for a very ſhort time, for the negotiating of the Peace only, or, if it were to laſt for a long term, that Conqueſts ſhould be reſtored. Nor was there better ſucceſs in the ſuſpenſion of Arms by Sea, which was alſo propoſed, to give the <hi>Turks</hi> ſome apprehenſion; for the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being no leſs differing than the intereſts, whatſoever inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhewed to it, furniſhed the <hi>French</hi> with an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reject it, out of a belief, that they were induced to yield their aſſent from weakneſs and the fear of their Naval preparations. So that during all this preſent year nothing elſe was wrought out for the Peace, but that the Emperour at the inſtance of <hi>Giovanni Grimani,</hi> Ambaſſadour for the Republick, conſented a ſafe conduct to the <hi>Palatine,</hi> to ſend his Miniſters to the Meeting.</p>
               <p>As to that of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for the Provinces of <hi>Holland,</hi> after the Cardinal <hi>Infante</hi> had by ſeveral means ſought, but in vain, to bring them to a Treaty, he diſpatched it, but it was not by them accepted; for expreſſing, to grant it to the Deputies of the <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Low Countries:</hi> And upon this conteſt they dwelt long, <hi>Spain</hi> not aſſenting to the Character of Ambaſſadours, thereby not to authorize their Soveraignty, but willing rather to leave a blank for the quality, to the end, it might be inſerted by the States themſelves, as they deſired it. But that pleaſed not <hi>Holland</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo that careleſs of the dangers of the Republick, and the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and preparations of the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſo far was it from facilitating Peace, that ſome rather doubted, that the <hi>Venetians</hi> applications to the affairs of the Sea did much promote the Princes deſigns to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb <hi>Italy.</hi> And to ſay truth, ſhe underwent ſtrange and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous accidents; for Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> being come the beginning of the year out of <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Milan,</hi> held with the Cardinal his Brother <hi>Trivultio,</hi> the Governour, <hi>Aragona</hi> and the Great Chancellor aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a cloſe and ſecret Meeting, in which it was reſolved to make War in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The difficulties they met with about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner were not ſmall, becauſe the Princes, what with the diſpoſition of the people and with Intelligences, hoped to make a Conqueſt of the Country for themſelves, and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who furniſhed the money and men for it, pretended, that the advantage of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts ſhould be theirs, to ballance it with the loſſes which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or feared elſewhere. It was at laſt agreed, that what ſhould come to be conquered by the Kings Forces ſhould be kept by the
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:53750:237"/>
ſame, and as much as ſhould voluntarily ſubmit, ſhould be at the diſpoſing of the Princes, who, tranſported by their intereſts, conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the two Crowns, the one with open Hoſtility, and the other under the pretext of ſuccours, ſhould rent <hi>Piedmont</hi> into pieces.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> could have deſired, that the Emperour would have ſent a body of his Troops into <hi>Italy,</hi> or at leaſt a General to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thoſe of the <hi>German</hi> Nation, which they had in their ſervice in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> to the end, that the cauſe might have received autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Emperours Name, and he have been conſtituted Judge betwixt the pretended Tutors of the little Duke; but Count <hi>Traat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſtorf, Ferdinand</hi>'s moſt favoured Miniſter, kept him off from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Affairs of that Province, the Emperour complaining ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that for the intereſts of <hi>Piedmont</hi> the more weighty ones of the Empire were neglected, and in particular thoſe of <hi>Alſace,</hi> which ſo much concerned the Houſe in general. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, to comply with them, he declares null the Teſtament of the Duke <hi>Vittorio,</hi> and decrees the Princes Tutors to the Nephew. They under this colour publiſh a Manifeſt to gain them the people, and diſanulled all the acts of the Regent, who, with other Writings and contrary Edicts, maintained her right and authority. But, paſſing quickly from the Pen to the Sword, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> getting firſt into the Field, one part of the Army, with <hi>Martino d' Aragona,</hi> went to beſiege <hi>Centio,</hi> not ſo much to open the paſſages, as to draw the applications and <hi>French</hi> Forces into thoſe parts. The enterpriſe was carried on by <hi>Antonio Sottello;</hi> for that <hi>Aragona,</hi> taking a view of the Town of <hi>Salicetto,</hi> near to <hi>Centio,</hi> with the ſhot of a Musket was killed. In this while Prince <hi>Thomas,</hi> with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops only, ſurpriſes the Town of <hi>Chivas,</hi> not far from <hi>Turin,</hi> and it was firmly believed, that he held intelligence with the Governour; becauſe, though he brake down the Gate with a Petard, there did not appear, in thoſe within, a diſpoſal of thoſe Orders for the defence, which in caſe of ſudden and unexpected accidents uſe to be given out by thoſe that have the command. The Prince <hi>Cardinal</hi> conveyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thither, to ſtir up the people in his favour nearer hand, but the Garriſon and the Governour were placed by the <hi>Spaniards. Tomaſo</hi> loſing no time to go on, takes <hi>Chieri</hi> and <hi>Moncalieri,</hi> ſo ſoon as he came before them. The Town of <hi>Aglié</hi> making reſiſtance was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and <hi>Inurea</hi> taken by force after a ſhort defence. <hi>La Valle d' Agosta</hi> declared it ſelf to be at the Princes devotion, and becauſe both hearts and Gates were opened to them, <hi>Verrua</hi> and <hi>Creſcentino</hi> were given up, the Inhabitants in this laſt hindring the <hi>French</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to defend it. To open the Navigation of the <hi>Po, Ponteſtura</hi> in <hi>Monferrat</hi> was taken in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomaſo,</hi> coming near to the City of <hi>Turin,</hi> filled every thing with alteration, and ſuch a muttering, that the Dutcheſs was more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of a tumult of the people, than the aſſault of the Enemy. Nor did this ſo much ariſe from the felicity of the late ſucceſſes, and from the ſatisfactions which accompanied the Name and Arms of the Prince, as from the great number of Partiſans and Confidents he
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:53750:238"/>
had in <hi>Turin,</hi> ſome whereof firſt with ſecret and now with open diſcourſes ſtirred up the minds of all againſt the preſent Government. For this cauſe the Regent, ſending the little Duke and the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for greater ſecurity, to <hi>Monmelian,</hi> was forced to commit her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to the cuſtody and direction of the <hi>French. La Valetta</hi> orders the defence, Sentinels, and Guards; whereupon the people, that fluctuated amidſt various affections, were reſtrained rather by fear than fidelity. The Prince, ſeeing no commotion in his favour, retires. While he ſtayed at <hi>Valentino,</hi> the <hi>Nuntio Caffarelli,</hi> who reſided for the Pope in <hi>Turin,</hi> brought him, in the name of the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, advantageous conditions of Peace; but without effect, they excluding his coming into <hi>Turin,</hi> and participation in the Regency, which the Prince pretended. The <hi>French</hi> tempted the Cardinal, accounting it great advantage, if they could but ſeparate him from his Brother; in him, as in the eldeſt, reſiding the more legitimate ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the ſucceſſion and the tutelage.</p>
               <p>But in the pitch of ſo propitious fortune the Brothers, not willing by dividing to weaken their hopes and the party, linked themſelves ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo much the faſter with the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and <hi>Thomaſo,</hi> in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with <hi>Leganes,</hi> marches to beſiege <hi>Moncalvo,</hi> and, before it was rendred, ſeparating with ſome Troops ſurpriſes <hi>Villa Nova d' Aſti.</hi> Both the Brothers afterwards go to <hi>Aſti,</hi> a City furniſhed neither with Fortifications, Proviſions, nor a ſufficient Garriſon; but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within it certain Companies of <hi>Piemontois,</hi> who at the name of the Prince flying away, both Arms and Colours rendred without defence. The Commander <hi>Balbiani,</hi> who was the Governour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into the Citadel, but kept it not above three days; it being weak, little, and commanded by a ſmall Fort upon the Hill, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Nevertheleſs, becauſe he expected not the Cannon, he was ſuſpected, that he had before the Siege been overcome either by affection towards the Princes, or ſome other intereſt. The Citadel remaining in the hands of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the City was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Princes, either in order to the Agreement, becauſe it rendred voluntarily, or rather becauſe, being expoſed to whom was Maſter of the Field, <hi>Leganes</hi> did not care to employ a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon there, keeping it under with the Citadel, which remained in his power. The Cardinal fixes his reſidence there; but beginning, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Brother, to be aware, that they were made uſe of, as inſtruments of their own and the Country's ſlavery, they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to raiſe a body of men to act apart from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> take places, and form a third party, which might render them more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by Strangers, and acceptable to the people; and demanded of <hi>Leganes,</hi> in conformity to the Agreement, money to make Levies. He furniſhes it but ſcantily, to the end, that having Forces of their own, they might not take the liberty and courage to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> party. In the mean time making profit of the Enemies diſorders, and of the countenance but rather weakneſs of the Princes, he promoted the advantages of the Crown, making progreſs in the <hi>Monferrat;</hi> ſo that having forced the Caſtle of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calvo,</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:53750:238"/>
he came to the Siege of <hi>Trino.</hi> A thouſand Souldiers which were within it were not ſufficient for the great circuit, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fortifications which environed that place. For which cauſe, <hi>la Valetta</hi> having not been able to prevent the Siege by ſuccours, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had the good luck not only to take the Out-works by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, but to enter into it, mingled with the defenders as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired.</p>
               <p>By this means <hi>Caſal</hi> remained blocked; whereupon <hi>la Valetta,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received out of <hi>France</hi> ſome little renfort, carefully put into it eight hundred Souldiers, and aſſigns the Government to Monſieur <hi>de la Tour,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> being dead there, who firſt had it. But not having Forces to be able to reſiſt in ſeveral places, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides <hi>Carmagnuola, Chivaſco,</hi> and ſome other places, more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious or ſuſpected, abandoning <hi>Alba</hi> with ſome other Towns, not poſſible to be kept. <hi>Cuneo</hi> alſo declares it ſelf in favour of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which ſerved to open them the way to <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>French</hi> ſuccours by Sea; and <hi>Sant' Ja</hi> gave it ſelf to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards:</hi> ſo that, except the Metropolis, ſcarce any other remained entire in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> To oppoſe himſelf to ſo many loſſes, <hi>la Valetta</hi> goes out of <hi>Turin,</hi> recovers <hi>Chieri,</hi> cutting the Garriſon in pieces, and together with the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> come out of <hi>France</hi> with ſome Troops, marches towards <hi>Aſti,</hi> where by Intelligence he hoped to ſurpriſe the Town, and take the two Princes Priſoners, who were then within it. Underſtanding in his march, that the Plot was diſcovered, changing his way he goes to <hi>Chivas,</hi> and ſits down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
               <p>The ſuccours, which <hi>Leganes</hi> upon knowledge of it ſent, came not in time; nor availed it, that he, to hinder Victuals, lodged with his Army betwixt that place and <hi>Turin;</hi> much leſs, that aſſaulting the Lines, he attempted to force them. Wherefore they being ſtoutly defended, he was conſtrained to abandon it; ſo that the Baron <hi>de Sebach,</hi> the Governour having want of proviſions and relief, ſurrenders. During this Siege, the Prince Cardinal, invited by the Governours of <hi>Villa Franca</hi> and <hi>Nizza,</hi> going towards theſe parts, taking in his way <hi>Ceva</hi> with other places, found, that his reception into the Towns fore-mentioned came to be hindred by the <hi>French,</hi> who with 18 Gallies and 24 Veſſels lay before them, when, at the appearing of certain <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, removing to chaſe them, the Governours opened the Gates, the Citadel of <hi>Nizza</hi> only reſiſting for ſome days. The <hi>French</hi> intended with the whole Army to attempt the relief of it; but not coming in time, having in their march taken the Caſtles of <hi>Bene, Foſſano,</hi> and <hi>Mondovi,</hi> reſolved to attacque <hi>Cuneo,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Intelligence, they had within it, had been diſcovered. But ſuch conqueſts and attempts could not countervail the loſſes and the dangers; whereupon, the Dutcheſs making great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to obtain more vigorous aſſiſtance from <hi>France, Monſieur de Chavigny,</hi> Secretary of State, arrives at <hi>Turin,</hi> not ſo much to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her as to intimate to her, <hi>That there was no other way of ſafety for her but that of putting her ſelf and the Country blindfold into the
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:53750:239"/>
Kings truſt, who then ingaged in reputation and intereſt, would with a ſtrong hand and all his Forces come to her relief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s counſel, who equally fixed in the advantages of the King, and implacable in his own revenge upon the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> preferred the profit, offered him by the occaſion, before all other conſiderations. The Dutcheſs reſiſting as much as ſhe could, was at laſt forced to abandon <hi>Carmagnola, Savigliano,</hi> and <hi>Chieraſco</hi> to be garriſoned by <hi>French,</hi> for ſo long as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Princes ſhould retain their Conqueſts; and it was agreed, <hi>That the King, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towards</hi> Italy <hi>the end of the year, ſhould ſomewhere near the</hi> Alps <hi>ſpeak with his Siſter to concert the ſuccours, and give her reputation among Strangers and the people by ſo evident an appearance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and kindneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But a more lamentable accident confounded and caſt affairs into greater diſorder; for that <hi>Leganes</hi> marching to relieve <hi>Cuneo,</hi> and divert the <hi>French</hi> from that enterpriſe, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> ſecretly ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates from the Army, with a thouſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe, and with Ladders and Pettards coming to <hi>Turin,</hi> where he wanted not Intelligence, climbing by night that which was called the <hi>Green Baſtion,</hi> and, throwing down the Gate of the Caſtle, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome few <hi>French</hi> to flight, which upon the ſudden Alarm were flocked thither, takes the Town. The confuſion was ſuch, as in ſurpriſes uſes to proceed from the darkneſs, the noiſe and fury of the Conquerours, and from the diſtraction and terrour of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. The Prince reſtrains, though with trouble, the Souldiers from pillage, not to provoke the people ſo well affected to his name. Upon this ſucceſs the <hi>French</hi> were forced to riſe immediately from <hi>Cuneo,</hi> and come near to the Citadel of <hi>Turin</hi> to ſtrengthen it, and to withdraw the Dutcheſs, who had ſcarce had time that night to ſave her ſelf, half cloathed, with ſome Ladies and certain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leganes,</hi> with exceſs of pride for ſo great proſperities, coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Turin,</hi> would have the Citadel beſieged; for, that taken, as it ſeemed not difficult to him in that conſtitution of things, <hi>French</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours would be excluded out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Caſal</hi> remain a ſecure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to him. But in regard he pretended to garriſon it with his own Souldiers, the Princes with oppoſite ends, ere they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to the Siege, required ſecurity, that that and other places, gained undoubtedly rather by the reputation and favour of their preſence, than the power of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Arms, might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned into their hands. Thus diſcord beginning to inſinuate it ſelf, the felicity of thoſe Arms was then at a ſtand, when it appeared to proceed with the greateſt proſperity. This ſtate of things cauſed great apprehenſions in <hi>Italy,</hi> it being doubted, leſt, all at laſt making way for the advantage of the more powerful, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would extend it ſelf to the <hi>Alps.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> making uſe of this reflection, ſtirred up the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> both with the fear of the progreſſes of <hi>Spain</hi> and with the hopes of their ſuccours, to take part in the Cauſe of the <hi>Savoyards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="465" facs="tcp:53750:239"/>The Pope, doubting that all tended to divide that Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Crowns, endeavoured by all ſorts of offices to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile the Princes to their Siſter-in-law. Nor were the <hi>Venetians,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the diſtraction towards the <hi>Levant,</hi> exempt from the inſtances of both the Crowns; for <hi>Monſieur d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſé</hi> for <hi>France</hi> ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, that they would give aſſiſtance to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and conſpire in the aims of that Crown; nay from inſtances paſſing to the conſiderations of common concern and weighty dangers, he did in a manner upbraid them, <hi>That forgetting their ancient Cuſtoms, they neglected the publick good for private offences. That the preſent buſineſs did not concern</hi> Vittorio <hi>deceaſed, but an innocent Orphan. Do then hatreds betwixt Princes laſt eternally? The friendſhip of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick was deſerved by all thoſe that equally loved the liberty of this Country, and have a common intereſt in it. That the queſtion now was concerning the enſlaving of all</hi> Italy, <hi>and while uncertain dangers were feared from the</hi> Turks <hi>ſide, evident miſchiefs were advanced by the yoke of</hi> Spain. <hi>To what purpoſe had ſhe heretofore defended</hi> Piedmont, <hi>and in</hi> Piedmont Italy <hi>with money, blood, and counſel, nay with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering her ſelf, if, at laſt neglecting it, ſhe ſhould now leave all in prey to the</hi> Spaniards? <hi>That in other times on appearances and threatnings, and not only upon Invaſions, ſhe had been juſtly moved; had called in Friends; ſtirred up the World; oppoſed Forces; but now unlike her ſelf, forgetting in a manner the recent Hoſtilities of the one, and abhorring the ancient friendſhips of the other, careleſly beheld the iſſue of things. By the Conqueſts of</hi> Monferrat <hi>and</hi> Piedmont <hi>ſuccours are excluded out of</hi> Italy, <hi>and the</hi> Alps <hi>ſhut up to</hi> France; <hi>but what does that import King</hi> Lewis, <hi>bating his great care of his friends, who might elſewhere more profitably extend his Confines, and enlarge his Conqueſts? The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate was to conſider of it, and the other Princes to give their minds to it; for the diſadvantages were at preſent ſuch, as could not be repaired with good offices, much leſs with deſires or counſels. That States were defended, Friends preſerved, and Publick Good protected with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with arms, and with actions, not with cautions and reſerves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by the Enemy for fear and a ſuperfluous awe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſuch apprehenſions the Count <hi>della Rocca,</hi> the Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> to remove Jealouſies, oppoſed a Diſcourſe no leſs effectual; he aſſured, <hi>That his King had no intention but to aſſiſt the Princes for the advantage of the Duke, whoſe Countries, under pretext of aid and protection, were ſeen poſſeſſed by the</hi> French. <hi>That the Governour of</hi> Milan <hi>did not, though on a ſubject ſo juſt, ingage ſo much of his own accord, as exhorted, intreated, and implored by the Princes themſelves and the people. Whilſt the Dutcheſs opened the Gates and the Towns to</hi> French <hi>Garriſons, why ſhould it not be lawful for the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Armies to oppoſe and prevent thoſe that deſigned, by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation of</hi> Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, <hi>the oppreſſion of</hi> Italy? <hi>Are then the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Garriſons more to be ſuſpected by the Princes than the ſupplies of</hi> French <hi>Forces? Let them behold in</hi> Pignarol <hi>and in</hi> Caſal <hi>what was the iſſue of the Tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage or of the aſſiſtances given by that Crown. Let there be a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all things; let its own be reſtored by all, to the Houſe of</hi> Savoy
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:53750:240"/>
                  <hi>and of</hi> Mantua; <hi>let</hi> Italy <hi>be put into its priſtine ſtate, and the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the publick quiet excluded, and let the World afterwards be Judge, which of the two Kings, with a mind more upright, is inclined to Juſtice and to Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He preſſed beſides, that the Count <hi>della Manta</hi> might be admitted to Audience, ſent by the Princes to <hi>Venice,</hi> under pretence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Republick of their Reaſons and Rights; but aiming per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure more ſecretly to procure them ſome private aſſiſtance, to form that party, which they had in their thoughts, independent from the Crowns. But the Senate refuſed to hear him, anſwering as to the reſt in the ſame expreſſions equally uſed to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> exhorting to a general Peace, and above all to the tranquillity of <hi>Italy.</hi> They alledged their juſt ſuſpicions of the Arms of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which, if at preſent they involved the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick in apprehenſions and troubles, tended to greater advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges againſt all Chriſtians. If ſuch reaſons had any force to render the two Kings ſatisfied with the Republicks Neutrality, they availed nothing for conciliating a Peace, it appearing every day more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that for the ſame cauſes, for which there was a breaking into War, it was likely to continue a long time. The <hi>Venetians</hi> therefore being to expect little ſuccours in their neceſſity, whilſt they ſaw the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſlighted, applied themſelves to ſome kind of compoſure with the <hi>Turks,</hi> which might at leaſt be able to retard that miſchief, for which there appeared as yet no remedy in a readineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amurath,</hi> as hath been ſaid, being come to <hi>Diarbechir,</hi> intended to continue his way to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> for the plague raging more and more, had almoſt conſumed all the Army, and the remaining Souldiers were mutined againſt the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> murmuring at the King himſelf, as if, wont to palliate his avarice with his cruelty, he had abandoned his Souldiers to the plague and to ſufferings, expreſly to defraud them of thoſe recompences and gifts, which were wont to be beſtowed by the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Kings on thoſe that well deſerved, and the victorious Armies. The <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> having had much ado to quiet them, ſollicited from his own danger, counſelled <hi>Amurath</hi> to remain in thoſe Provinces, prognoſticating otherwiſe, that the Souldiers in his abſence would loſe all diſcipline and reſpect, and the Conqueſts would with as much ſhame be expoſed, as they had been gotten with glory. But the ſelf ſame conſiderations expreſly haſtened the Kings departure, both to withdraw himſelf from the grumblings of the Souldiers, and not to be a Spectator, without force, of that, which the <hi>Perſians</hi> might attempt. To take away every ſhadow and every chief, which might but in name give countenance to ſedition, ſince the <hi>Turks</hi> are not accuſtomed to ſeek Kings out of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family, he diſpatches, as he was upon the way, order to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to take away the life of his Uncle <hi>Muſtapha.</hi>

               <p>This unhappy man having twice ſcarce taſted the Empire, was kept in a moſt ſtrict priſon, always hating life, and every moment fearing death. The order, as uſual, was immediately executed, though there remained none of the Blood Royal but one Brother of
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:53750:240"/>
                  <hi>Amurath,</hi> believed a Fool. The King, purſuing his Journey, made a ſolemn Vow to his falſe Prophet, not to lay down his Sword till he ſhould have ſubjected the Chriſtians to his Empire and Law. But God hath ſet limits to the fury of man as well as bounds to the Sea. <hi>Amurath,</hi> through the ſtrength of his body ſottiſhly fierce, gave himſelf up as a prey to every exceſs, particularly that of Wine. His Genius was his Law-maker, though to the contempt of the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> which expreſly forbid it; and his example prevailing over the Authority of the Law, drunkenneſs became familiar with the <hi>Turks.</hi> The complexion of the King, though of the ſtrongeſt, not able to bear inceſſant diſorder, was at laſt ſhaken, and on the way ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a dangerous ſickneſs. He found himſelf weakned in ſuch ſort, that moderating the pride of his mind, he inclines to thoughts of Peace. At <hi>Smith,</hi> not far from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> his pleaſure was to hold a Council about it, and there it was fully conſidered, <hi>The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in</hi> Aſia <hi>deſtroyed, the War of</hi> Perſia <hi>not as yet ended, the difficulty to put to Sea a powerful Fleet, thirty Gallies to bridle the</hi> Coſſacks <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be imployed in the Black Sea: That the</hi> Venetians <hi>had advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly made uſe of the time, provided for the Iſlands and Towns, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Fleet, and had ordered and in a readineſs all ſorts of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was then ſecretly reſolved to ſtoop to an accord; but ſuch is always the cuſtom of that Government to ſhew it ſelf averſe to it, to maintain its faſte, and meliorate the conditions. Their great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations therefore made a great noiſe, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> did oppoſe as great, having choſen Proveditor General of the Sea, with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Captain General, <hi>Luigi Giorgio,</hi> Procurator of St. <hi>Marco,</hi> to the end, that he ſhould arm and go forth, according as he ſhould be clearly informed of the <hi>Turks</hi> hoſtile intentions. The <hi>Tartars,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Crim,</hi> depending upon the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port, made at this time, to revenge themſelves of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and to arm the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies with Slaves, an Incurſion into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> bringing away a great Booty and number of men, which they ſold (as is their cuſtom) to the <hi>Turks</hi> at a low rate.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Amurath</hi> being come to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> made not his entry with any deſigned Triumph; becauſe, weakned with the late acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he could not ſit vigorouſly on Horſe-back; ſome principal Priſoners only were brought in, and a great quantity of Gold, which ſtupendiouſly exceeded the ſum expended for the War of <hi>Perſia:</hi> So much are the <hi>Ottomans</hi> wont to make profit by their Armies, which to other Princes ſerve to conſume their Treaſure. He preſently let the <hi>Bailo</hi> know, that he held him no more a publick Miniſter, but the Hoſtage for Ships hoſtilly taken within his Port. Diſplacing <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> the <hi>Caimecan,</hi> he nevertheleſs orders <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> ſubſtituted into the ſame Charge, that he ſhould not ſhut his ears to a Treaty. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarini</hi> was admitted to Audience, and the <hi>Baſſa</hi> quietly hearing the reaſons of the fact and the fixed reſolution of the Senate, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up in exchange their own Gallies, condeſcended at laſt to an adjuſtment, which conſiſted, <hi>In the</hi> Bailoes <hi>promiſing ſome money as
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:53750:241"/>
in reparation of the hurt done at</hi> Vallona, <hi>in reſtoring that Veſſel which was in being, as properly belonging to the</hi> Turks; <hi>as to other things, that all ſorts of pretenſions ſhould be ſilenced; that the</hi> Corſaires <hi>ſhould be commanded not to moleſt the</hi> Venetians <hi>and the Governours of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, not to receive them in the Ports, till firſt caution given, not to make any diſturbance. That the Commanders for the Republick might puniſh the ſaid</hi> Corſaires <hi>in conformity to the ancient Capitulations; that Commerce ſhould be renewed, and the</hi> Bailo <hi>be reſtored to his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and houſe:</hi> As was done, the <hi>Caimecan</hi> ſending him back with a Veſt of Gold, which is an Honour uſed by the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The advice of this agreement coming unexpectedly to <hi>Venice,</hi> raiſed in mens minds (as it happens in great things and unlooked for) diverſity of thoughts, whilſt ſome were not wanting, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the reflections of the Government with the diſcourſes of the Vulgar, judged that it would have been good counſel to have ſecured themſelves with Arms rather than with Money, out of a doubt, that the <hi>Turks</hi> making a ſhew of Peace, would by this falſe ſecurity protract their revenge, and under a feigned tranquillity, till a better conjuncture, cover their hatreds and diſguſts. But the Senate, from the experience of former times and the conjuncture of preſent things, undeceived as to the hopes of Chriſtian aſſiſtances, ſoberly weighing the dangers, the charges, and the conſequences of the War, which might be carried on rather with good courage than with equal Forces and good ſucceſſes, having formerly commanded the <hi>Bailo</hi> to endeavour an accord, approved the concluſion, partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating to the Princes to have reſolved to procure honeſt conditions of Peace, ſince the ſtate of Chriſtendom underſtood the trouble of ſuch a War unſeaſonable. The reſolution was approved of all, and by the Pope, judging that the Peace had been prudently managed by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and with commendations equal to the Generoſity with which they had encountred the danger.</p>
               <p>It happened at the inſtant the accord was ready to be executed, that the <hi>Turks</hi> on the Confines of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> for private diſputes which are frequent amongſt thoſe Neighbours, entred armed into the Territories of the Republick, ſo that <hi>Marino Molino,</hi> who had been aſſumed into the Charge of Proveditor General of the Horſe, to repulſe them and repair himſelf, attacques them in four places; and in thoſe Factions, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> the principal Diſturber of quiet being killed, the Hurliburly with his life ended. At <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt the Republick and all preparations for a Fleet ceaſed, but not the ſuſpicion, that there was not ſome deſign againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom elſewhere; for that <hi>Amurath,</hi> recovered ſomewhat in his health and ſtrength, ſought for Peace with the <hi>Perſian.</hi> That King, after <hi>Amurath</hi> was gone, had retaken <hi>Revan,</hi> and having made Peace with the <hi>Tartar Osbech,</hi> had the luck to beat the <hi>Mogor</hi> and to keep the poſſeſſion of <hi>Candahar.</hi> Nevertheleſs, becauſe War with the <hi>Turks</hi> uſes not to be advantagious to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he deſired Peace, and to negotiate it, had ſent Ambaſſadours to the Port, where the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> was alſo arrived. The difficulty about <hi>Revan</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:53750:241"/>
that <hi>Amurath</hi> deſired it ſhould be reſtored, and the <hi>Perſians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, underſtood, that the Capitulations made in the time of <hi>Soliman</hi> ſhould only be confirmed. <hi>Amurath</hi> determines to remand the Ambaſſadours into <hi>Perſia</hi> together with a Miniſter of his own, that might ſound intentions and obſerve affairs, for the future better direction of his Counſels and Arms, ſince that in <hi>Europe</hi> he ſaw riſing up ſeveral accidents, very ſeaſonable for his end to imploy them againſt the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Moldavia</hi> had obtained of the Port, by the wonted means of money, to give up that Province to his Son, and himſelf to be ſubſtituted to the <hi>Wallachian;</hi> but he publiſhing, that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der came not from the King, but from the corrupted Miniſters, puts himſelf in defence, and marching againſt that other, defeats him and drives him away. <hi>Amurath,</hi> that knew not what was doing in <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachia,</hi> or at leaſt to cover the diſhonour of the ſucceſs, feigned, not to know it, vents his wrath againſt the <hi>Caimecan,</hi> as if bribed by the <hi>Moldavian</hi> he had concealed the buſineſs from him, and cauſed him to be ſtrangled in the ſeven Towers, confiſcating all the Eſtate he had. He could not for all that digeſt the affront, and diſpoſed things, framing pretexts to diſturb the <hi>Wallachian</hi> again, in aſſurance to break out into a War againſt the Chriſtians, either in <hi>Hungary</hi> or in <hi>Poland,</hi> becauſe it was believed, that the <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacks</hi> would not ſuffer that Prince to be deſtroyed, and it might well be, that the Emperour, though greatly imployed elſewhere, might be ingaged in it.</p>
               <p>But Heaven diverted this blow; for <hi>Amurath</hi> was ſurpriſed with a more dangerous ſickneſs, in the fears whereof being exhorted by the <hi>Muſti</hi> and his Mother, he vowed to abſtain for the future from Wine, and, for the earneſt of his Oath, brake the moſt precious Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels wherein he drank. Being ſcarce recovered, and unmindful of the danger he had run, and of his promiſe, he falls again to ſuch exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant diſorders, that relapſing he dyed the 7. of <hi>February</hi> of the year following in the night, in the two and thirtieth of his Age, and the fifteenth of his Empire.</p>
               <p>Of ſeveral Sons which he had had, none remaining alive, the Empire fell to his Brother <hi>Ibrain,</hi> who was ſeven and twenty years old; but either for fear of death, which he expected every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or through the ſolitude of the Priſon where he was kept, amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in childiſh exerciſes, was of a ſtupid and dull Underſtanding. He was not eaſily induced to believe, that the Empire was fallen to his lot; but fearing rather to be haled away to be ſtrangled, he would not go out of his Chamber, till the body of his Brother was brought to him, at the ſight whereof he cryed out, (uttering words not ſo ſimple) that a great King was dead, but withal a moſt cruel Tyrant. Paſſing thereupon in a moment from a Priſon to an Empire, new to himſelf, much more to buſineſs, he leaves the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them to his Mother and <hi>Muſtapha</hi> the <hi>Grand Viſier.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Republick, according to cuſtom, appoints <hi>Pietro Foſcarini</hi> as Ambaſſadour Extraordinary to congratulate with him, and <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolamo

Treviſano</hi> to ſucceed to the <hi>Bailo.</hi> Upon this mutation of Government at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> it in truth looked as if Chriſtendom might have a breathing, but it was afterwards ſeen, how blind the judgments of men are, and that where force prevails, it is rendred more formidable, if reaſon ſtep not in to correct it. But that ſhall be reſerved for the following years.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Turin</hi> the ſpreading of the Troops had given means to the <hi>French,</hi> to whom the Dutcheſs had wholly committed the defence of the Citadel, to put a better Garriſon and Proviſions into it; whereupon the Peace being rendred more difficult, becauſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Princes fell to the ground, that together with the City the Citadel ſhould be kept by Subjects truſted by both the parties: The Nuntio at laſt prevailed in the conſent to a Truce, from the fourth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> to the twenty fourth of <hi>October,</hi> which was punctually executed in <hi>Italy,</hi> though in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>Spain</hi> it was with unanimous opinions, but for differing cauſes, cenſured. To the <hi>French</hi> nevertheleſs it was of great advantage; becauſe the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> with the Troops deſtined for <hi>Italy,</hi> was able in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> and <hi>Alſace</hi> to make conſiderable Conqueſts; ſo that <hi>Leganes</hi> was ſo much the more blamed in <hi>Spain,</hi> by how much that, beſides the putting a ſtop to fortune in the moſt happy courſe of proſperity and keeping the Forces employed in <hi>Italy,</hi> he gave time to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to ſtrengthen themſelves, and draw advantages from elſewhere. The Marqueſs <hi>delle Fuente</hi> was then ſent from <hi>Madrid</hi> to <hi>Milan,</hi> to the end, that reproaching <hi>Leganes</hi> with his errour he might more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually enjoin him to apply himſelf to <hi>Caſal,</hi> without the conqueſt whereof <hi>Olivares</hi> wrote plainly, that, notwithſtanding ſo many ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, he accounted nothing of moment done. But in <hi>Italy</hi> things proceeded not with the facility which from far off the <hi>Condé</hi> Duke imagined; for by the attempting that place, many Princes might grow jealous, and to uſe force, Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> was to be perſwaded to it, who, if doubting leſt the Citadel of <hi>Turin</hi> ſhould fall into the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hands, had precipitated the concluſion of the Truce, and forced the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> to conſent to it, it was not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he ſhould co-operate ſincerely in the taking of <hi>Caſal,</hi> which ſeemed the high-way to the ſlavery of <hi>Italy</hi> and the oppreſſion of <hi>Piedmont:</hi> nevertheleſs <hi>Melo</hi> was by <hi>Leganes</hi> ſent to <hi>Turin</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to it. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> intricated in theſe Negotiations, the Emperour experiencing moſt ſenſible miſchiefs complained high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both of the Truce in <hi>Italy,</hi> and of the ingaging the Army in that Country, whilſt he loſt <hi>Alſace,</hi> and <hi>Banier,</hi> increaſed to little leſs than thirty thouſand fighting men, was wandring towards <hi>Bohemia</hi> to gain quarters there.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> counſelled the Emperour to go himſelf into the Field, and command the Army, being in great diſorder through the diſcords and emulations of the Chiefs; and in requital of the ſuccours, which they received from him in <hi>Flanders,</hi> beſides the payment of ſix thouſand <hi>Hungarians,</hi> they furniſhed him with a great ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. But <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> abhorring the charge and the danger which
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:53750:242"/>
the aſſuming of the command of the Army carried with it, allots it to the Archduke <hi>Leopold Guilielmo</hi> his Brother; but to make an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort capable to drive the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of <hi>Germany,</hi> he had recourſe to the Pope, demanding of him a powerful aſſiſtance. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes himſelf, becauſe the differences of the <hi>Venetians</hi> with the <hi>Turks</hi> being not yet appeaſed, he profeſſed, that for that cauſe, abandoned by every body elſe, he was ingaged to imploy his mind and all his Forces. The hopes then of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> depending upon <hi>Spain</hi> alone, and the recovery of <hi>Alſace</hi> highly concerning him, he ſends <hi>Hannibal Gonzagha</hi> Ambaſſadour Extraordinary to <hi>Madrid,</hi> by whom a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was concluded to raiſe at common Charge an Army for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be commanded by <hi>Melo.</hi> This Levy went not forward to deſigns of War, the hopes of a Treaty intervening; for Duke <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> of <hi>Weimar</hi> dying at <hi>Neoburg</hi> in the thirty ſixth year of his Age, ſnatcht away by a ſhort ſickneſs, in the greateſt progreſs of Glory, the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> believed with money and advantages to gain <hi>Erlach</hi> and other principal Commanders, that had the Command of <hi>Briſach</hi> and the places of conſequence.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Richelieu,</hi> with his wonted Aſcendant of Wit and Fortune, concludes a more ſpeedy and happy Treaty with them; for capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating with a vaſt ſum of money the mind of thoſe, to whom the Duke in his Teſtament had committed the care of the Army, he agreed with them, <hi>That they ſhould accept the Duke of</hi> Longueville <hi>for their General, and be obliged to make War for the advantages and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of</hi> France, <hi>who was to pay the Army and Garriſon of</hi> Briſach, <hi>which, under the Government of</hi> Erlach, <hi>ſhould be compoſed of</hi> Germans <hi>and</hi> French.</p>
               <p>It happened, that <hi>Charles Lodowick Palatine,</hi> who was then at <hi>London,</hi> no ſooner heard the News of <hi>Weimars</hi> death, but poſting <hi>incognito</hi> through <hi>France,</hi> endeavours to get to that Army, in hope not only by conformity of Religion, Manners, and Tongue, but by money and promiſes from the King of <hi>England</hi> to induce it to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept him for their Chief, by which means he afterwards propoſed to himſelf, either by Force or Treaty, for the exchange of <hi>Alſace</hi> to recover the <hi>Palatinate. Richelieu,</hi> who by many Spies had his eyes every where, being advertiſed of ſuch an intention, cauſed him at <hi>Molins</hi> in the <hi>Borbonnois</hi> to be arreſted, and did not releaſe him, though the King of <hi>England,</hi> not without complaints, preſſed it, till the Treaty with the <hi>Weimarians</hi> was finiſhed. Thus in a moment fell into the power of <hi>France</hi> a Town, a Province, an Army, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great reflections of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and greater of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who would have wiſhed that Crown an Aſſiſtant and Neighbour, but not ſo much advanced into the Empire. Neither were other proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Provinces of <hi>Flanders</hi> wanting to the ſame; for though in the beginning of the Campagnia <hi>Piccolomini</hi> had beaten <hi>Monſieur de Fichieres,</hi> who beſieged <hi>Thionville,</hi> and with many Arts brought him with many others into that Town Priſoner; yet on the other ſide, <hi>Monſieur de la Meillerey</hi> paſſing through the County of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> incamps with ten thouſand Foot and eight thouſand Horſe before
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:53750:243"/>
                  <hi>Heſdin,</hi> a place of great accounts, and having ſprung two Mines and given three aſſaults, took it, being rendred on conditions.</p>
               <p>The King, who to countenance the action abode with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal at <hi>Abbeville,</hi> entring into <hi>Heſdin</hi> by the breach, and adding reward to Merit, created him Mareſhal of <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Infanta</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken Poſt at <hi>Bourbourg</hi> had attempted in vain to ſuccour it; for <hi>Orange</hi> ſeconding the deſign, ſomtimes threatning to attacque <hi>Guelder,</hi> and then attempting to diſ-imbark at the <hi>Sas</hi> of <hi>Gant,</hi> he had been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to divide his Forces. The chief counſel of <hi>Richelieu</hi> conſiſted in incommodating the <hi>Spaniards</hi> upon their own Frontiers, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating to King <hi>Lodowick, That the Enemy being invaded at home, would diſcover his weakneſs, and that Monarchy want ſtrength to ſupply in ſo many parts foreign accidents; that many Provinces would quickly appear mutinous, all groaning under the Government of inſolent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, with few Fortreſſes, and they without truſty Garriſons, with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers for the moſt part mercenary, and Strangers, eſpecially when they ſhould be aware, that they were under a Government burdenſom, in Peace and in War unhappy.</hi> An imagination which came to paſs perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the belief of the Author himſelf, through ſuch caſualties and ſad emergencies, that the World had occaſion to believe, that though for the moſt part humane counſels depend upon events, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune did adjuſt events to the counſels of <hi>Richelieu.</hi> He laid the foundations of it in this year, by ſending the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Pirenei,</hi> who took <hi>Salces,</hi> the firſt place that lies neareſt to the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, on the Confines of <hi>Spain,</hi> though after ſome months it was recovered by <hi>Philip Spinola.</hi> He had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved greater hopes of the Naval Army, which, commanded by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in number about ſixty Veſſels, plyed to and again upon the Coaſt in the Ocean; but the effects proved not ſuitable, for it effected nothing but the landing at <hi>Laredo,</hi> taking and burning certain Ships, and plundering ſome weak maritime places.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Spain</hi> received a notable blow; for after <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> was retired into the Ports of <hi>France,</hi> 67 Ships, amongſt which, ſome were of a vaſt burden, ſpread their Sails towards <hi>Flanders,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon them many Souldiers, a great quantity of money and other proviſions, to carry a powerful relief into the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> The way to paſs into thoſe Provinces by Land being on all ſides ſtopt, and to provide them money, the exchange devouring a great part, it had been reſolved in <hi>Madrid</hi> to make an effort by Sea, in concert with the King of <hi>England,</hi> who jealous of the Greatneſs and of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of <hi>France,</hi> deſiring to ſee them ſuccoured and provided, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted retreat and ſecurity for the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships into his Ports. But this Fleet no ſooner appeared in the Chanel, but <hi>Martin Tromp,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral of <hi>Holland,</hi> with thirteen ſmall, but nimble and well appointed Ships, comes up with it, provoking it with incredible boldneſs to fight. Sixteen others a while after joyned themſelves to him, and by the nearneſs of the Ports of <hi>Zeland</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> receiving daily Renfort, was quickly increaſed to ſuch a face of a ſtrong Fleet, that
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:53750:243"/>
                  <hi>Anthonio Oquendo,</hi> General of the <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> though ſuperiour in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and in the bulk of Ships, thought good to retreat into the <hi>Downs</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> hoping that the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> obliged to keep the Sea, would by ill weather and winds be conſtrained to go further off. <hi>Tromp</hi> not only kept his courſe, but battered the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with his Cannon, being ſupplied with powder, which he wanted, by the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Calais.</hi> A Miſt at laſt was ſo favourable to <hi>Oquendo,</hi> that thirteen great Veſſels, with a good number of Souldiers and with all the money, paſſed without being diſcovered to <hi>Dunkirk. Tromp,</hi> who now found himſelf ſtrong one hundred and ſix Ships, troubled above meaſure at ſuch a paſſage, was ſo much the more careful, that the remaining prey ſhould not eſcape him. The King of <hi>England,</hi> who, for the honour of his Port, was greatly troubled about the iſſue of this accident, orders forty Ships to come into the <hi>Downs,</hi> that placing themſelves in the midſt, they might hinder fighting, and without breaking with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who exclaimed with threatning proteſts, might countenance the Retreat of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. Tromp</hi> for all that, not quitting his ſtation, <hi>Oquendo,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fight or be conſumed to nothing, attempts under the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a very foggy Miſt an eſcape towards <hi>Spain.</hi> But he eſcaped not at this time neither the vigilance of <hi>Tromp,</hi> who firſt preſſing with Fire-Ships into the midſt of the Enemy, and afterwards with Men of War, burnt ſome of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and took others, beſides thoſe, which running on ſhore were plundered and burnt alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oquendo</hi> with a few recovers <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the remainder got the Coaſt of <hi>Spain</hi> torn and ill handled by the Enemy and the Sea, there having periſhed above ſix thouſand men, Mariners and Souldiers, with the greater part of the Ships. <hi>Tromp,</hi> bringing ſixteen with a vaſt Booty in Triumph into <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> was received there with great joy, this Victory being reckoned amongſt the moſt famous of thoſe which have happened at Sea. The laſt cloſe of this Campag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ought to be concluded in <hi>Italy,</hi> where it had its beginning.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Lodowick</hi> arriving at laſt at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> according to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Savoy</hi> comes thither alſo, to depoſite again with lively tears her own intereſts and thoſe of the Duke in the arms of her Brother and of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> beſeeching them to protect this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Cauſe with the ſame power and generoſity, by which they made the <hi>French</hi> Crown formidable. It was given her to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the depoſiting of <hi>Monmeilian</hi> was required, and inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that her Son ſhould be ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> that he might be brought up with the <hi>Daulphin</hi> in ſafety and with honour. She anſwered with no other reaſons but a flood of tears; whereupon the King moved in his affection and compaſſion towards her, it was preſſed further, and ſhe was left, the Court returning to <hi>Paris</hi> in great hopes of ſpeedy and powerful ſuccours. The Army of <hi>Italy,</hi> (the Cardinal <hi>della Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lette</hi> being dead) remained in that interim recommended to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> Count of <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who was equally valiant and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Princes complained, that, under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the ſaid Truce, the Dutcheſs had delivered Towns to the <hi>French;</hi> and they quarrelled, that the entry of ſome Souldiers into <hi>Caſal,</hi> which afterwards were brought in by force, had been hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Leganes.</hi> Some expedients therefore being diſcourſed of, but to no purpoſe, to prolong it; the ſuſpenſion of Arms expires, and the Cannon from the Town and Citadel of <hi>Turin</hi> declared it, that began again to play with great fury. <hi>Harcourt</hi> kept the Field with an indifferent ſtrength of four thouſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe, and it hapned, that almoſt at the ſame time, that he by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways came to <hi>Chieri, Leganes</hi> arrives unexpectedly there with eleven thouſand fighting men, invironing him at large with many quarters. <hi>Harcourt</hi> thereupon within a while wants Victuals, though the Marqueſs <hi>Villa,</hi> making his paſſage through the midſt of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Poſts, put in a Convoy; but that being not ſufficient for the neceſſity, the <hi>French</hi> were forced to reſolve upon a retreat. They then were no ſooner gone out of <hi>Chieri,</hi> but they quickly felt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at their heels, and being come to the Bridge called <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kotta</hi> found Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> in their front. <hi>Harcourt</hi> then, with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of courage, giving no time to <hi>Leganes</hi> to come up with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, attacques the <hi>Savoyards</hi> with ſo great fury, that he forces them to yield him the Paſs. Whereupon, night coming on, he thought beſt not to continue his march, but employed it to fortifie the Bridge behind him, to give a ſtop to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as it happily ſucceeded; ſo that the day following proceeding on his way, though the <hi>Spaniards</hi> attempted it with ſeveral skirmiſhes, they could not hinder it or break him. This incounter coſt indeed the life of ſome of his Souldiers, and he was forced to leave ſome Carts of baggage behind him; nevertheleſs it was reckoned amongſt the moſt ſignal actions which rendred his name famous in <hi>Italy,</hi> having reaped great glory from that which uſes to be reckoned amongſt the moſt hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous employments in the War.</p>

               <p>From the diſcords of <hi>Piedmont</hi> were added new difficulties to the general Peace, the <hi>French</hi> requiring Paſs-ports for the Miniſters of the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> pretending that the Dutcheſs Mother ſhould therein be mentioned in the quality of Tutreſs and Regent, which being contrary to the late Decree of the Emperour, was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyed by the <hi>Auſtrians.</hi> There appearing therefore no hopes of Peace, diſcourſe was had of a general ſuſpenſion of Arms; but, the inclinations of the Crowns being diſcovered anew to be contrary

to it, and the Emperour oppoſing it, not to have the <hi>Swedes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the bowels of the Empire, and of his own Countries, the project vaniſhed. Nor did the Mediators much trouble themſelves to prolong that of <hi>Italy,</hi> they being not pleaſed that <hi>Piedmont</hi> ſhould be left in the power of the Crowns. Nevertheleſs the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty ſeemed to be on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſide, as well by reaſon of the pretenſion to comprehend the County of <hi>Burgundy</hi> in the Truce, as for the hope which <hi>Leganes</hi> gave to take <hi>Caſal,</hi> by which they reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remain ſo predominant in <hi>Italy,</hi> as with their Conqueſt there to balance their loſſes in other places. This was added beſides, that they knew not well where to employ their Army, the Paſſes being either ſtopped, or requiring long marches to ſend them elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. On the other ſide, the <hi>French</hi> by the advantage of ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the center of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Provinces might ſend their Militia, whither occaſion moſt called for them.</p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe Negotiations, the <hi>French</hi> inſinuate more ſecret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices with the Princes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> endeavouring above all to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and divide them amongſt themſelves; in order whereunto, they offered Prince <hi>Thomaſo</hi> to diſmember, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of Government, one part of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> that ſo he might enjoy it as in abſolute Soveraignty. He not truſting to ſuch flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet lent his ear to them, to keep the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> in jealouſie, and draw more eaſily from him ſatisfaction and money. The Cardinal <hi>Mauritio,</hi> more conſidered by reaſon of the Towns of <hi>Nizza</hi> and <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> which he had in his power, was alſo leſs difficult to be treated with, and the Dutcheſs knowing that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to marry, cauſed to be propoſed to him <hi>Maria Lodovica</hi> her eldeſt Daughter, as the only means to adjuſt the pretenſions and differences about the ſucceſſion, if the Duke ſhould come to fail. Though for the preſent nothing was concluded, yet the Cardinal inclined ſomewhat to it, to the great jealouſie of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and of the Prince his Brother, who for his own ends, and the intereſts of his Poſterity, made uſe of the name of <hi>Mauritio.</hi> It now clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared, that the deſigns and preparations of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> tended againſt <hi>Caſal,</hi> nay, <hi>Leganes</hi> proudly boaſted of the enterpriſe, and having Treaties with the Princeſs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and intelligence within the place, he thought to go to a moſt certain Victory. The Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> grew ſenſible of it; for, if with that of <hi>Caſal</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Conqueſts made in <hi>Piedmont</hi> ſhould be confirmed, there was formed even to the <hi>Alps</hi> a Wall ſo ſtrong, that there could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main no hopes to force it. Jealouſies alſo were ſuggeſted from diſcourſes caſt abroad by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters, and by the Count <hi>della Rocca</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Venice,</hi> in particular, that reckoning hence forward <hi>Caſal</hi> as a moſt ſecure Conqueſt, it was not conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that their Arms ſhould be carried on further, glancing at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> and every other place, where there appeared any ſhadow of the name or affection of <hi>France. France</hi> holding <hi>Caſal</hi> under the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of their Garriſons, nay valuing it as the depoſitory of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for having heretofore preſerved it with the terrour only of
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:53750:245"/>
its name, and ſuccoured it with ſo many difficulties, the King could not at preſent ſuffer it to be taken. But finding himſelf ingaged with his Forces in other deſigns, and the ſeaſon yet frozen rendring the paſſage of the <hi>Alps</hi> difficult; it ſeemed as if he neglected the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, making alſo as if he abandoned it, to induce the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to take upon them the defence of it. The <hi>Venetians</hi> in truth took great thought for it, and finding themſelves in a condition, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the adjuſtment with the <hi>Turks,</hi> to back their offices as was fit, exhorted <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> to arm himſelf, and to imploy all his endeavours for Peace.</p>
               <p>The Pope, though he apprehended the dangers no leſs than the Republick, ſtood upon great reſerves. He alledged the doubt of giving Jealouſie to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and bringing upon himſelf inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and troubles; nor prevailed it any thing, that the Republick aſſured, they would ſecond him in his reſolutions and uphold him in dangers; for he ſtuck not to publiſh, that he would not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to arm or uſe effectual offices, till the Republick ſhould have firſt entred into a League with him. It was ſufficiently underſtood, that the Pope, ſeeing his houſe ſuſpected by the <hi>Auſtrians,</hi> and little truſted by other Princes, aimed by this Union to conciliate reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reſpect to himſelf, and give ſupport to his Kindred. But for the proximate dangers of <hi>Caſal,</hi> this ſeemed to the <hi>Venetians</hi> a remedy too ſlow, and they rather thought it more capable to raiſe Jealouſies in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> upon which they might afterwards and more readily paſs to a Rupture, which only with a fair appearance of reſolution and conſtancy might be diverted. Theſe Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being not unknown to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſerved to provoke them to haſten the undertaking, in hopes that being in a ſhort time maſter of their deſign, and overcoming in the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes one fear by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would no more dare apply themſelves to prejudicial at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts or confederacies giving Jealouſie to their Crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leganes</hi> therefore ſending two thouſand men to attacque the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Roſſignano,</hi> that it might not diſturb the conveyance of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals to the Camp, cauſed <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> the Week before <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which happened to be the firſt day of <hi>April, Caſal</hi> to be inveſted by the Cavalry, and the <hi>Friday</hi> following, arrived there with the whole Army. There were not within it above one thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot and three hundred Horſe, all <hi>French,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Monſieur de la Tour,</hi> and although ſome of the <hi>Monferrins</hi> joyned themſelves to the Inhabitants, they ſerved rather for jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie than defence; becauſe, according to agreement of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with the Princeſs, they were rather to receive from them motives to render, than incouragements to hold out. <hi>La Tour</hi> then being hardly able with ſo ſcanty a Garriſon to keep the Citadel and the incloſure of the City, abſtains from Sallies, giving leave to <hi>Leganes</hi> to form his Lines without oppoſition, and diſpoſe of his Camp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other diſturbance than that of the ſeaſon, which with unuſual rains, hindred for certain days the Works. Three attacques were deſigned with three batteries. The greateſt force of the Siege was
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:53750:245"/>
uſed betwixt the Citadel and the Caſtle, or rather the greateſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; for, beſides the hope, that the people over-maſtering the Garriſon would quickly ſurrender, <hi>Leganes</hi> held correſpondences to be brought into the Caſtle, and ſo the City being poſſeſſed, he deſigned to block the Citadel by laying Forts about it, and then marching with the whole Army into <hi>Piedmont</hi> oppoſe the <hi>French,</hi> if they ſhould preſent themſelves for its ſuccours. Upon this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he neglected the outward Line of Circumvallation, being not able to perſwade himſelf, that the <hi>French,</hi> either during a time ſo ſhort, or with a number proportionable, could be ready to march. He notified by Letter to the Republick the motion of his Army, publiſhing the aims and intentions of his King to tend only to Peace, which if it could not be obtained ſo long as it was in the power of the <hi>French</hi> with <hi>Pignarol</hi> and <hi>Caſal</hi> to diſturb it, the driving them away ſeemed to be a motive of expediency and zeal, not a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to domination, or a deſire to uſurp that which is anothers.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time he ſends to <hi>Mantua</hi> the Count <hi>Mandelli,</hi> to aſſure the Princeſs, that amidſt theſe warlike proceedings he would as much as was poſſible have reſpect to the Dukes intereſt; and ſhe, to correſpond, ſends the Count <hi>Gabioneda</hi> to reſide in the Camp, in deſign, as was publiſhed, to preſerve <hi>Monferrat</hi> from the ruine and oppreſſions of the Souldiery, but with more ſecret intentions, to authorize with the preſence of her Miniſter the undertaking, divert the Peaſants from taking Arms, and exhort thoſe of <hi>Caſal</hi> to render, rather than ſuffer extremities. Nevertheleſs, to cover ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe ſought for counſel of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> intreating them to ſend a Miniſter of theirs to reſide with her, and inſinuating, that, whilſt the loſs of <hi>Caſal,</hi> through the weakneſs of the <hi>French,</hi> ſeemed immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, a propoſition might be made to have it depoſited in the Popes hands, to the end, that, at a charge common with the Republick, it might be preſerved for the legitimate Prince. But neither could the <hi>French</hi> in honour publiſh the want of power to defend it, nor did the ſpeed, with which <hi>Leganes</hi> proſecuted the enterpriſe, give time to negotiate it. The Senate cauſed <hi>Andrea Roſſo,</hi> who as Secretary was with <hi>Luigi Giorgio,</hi> General in <hi>Terra firma,</hi> to paſs to <hi>Mantua.</hi> But judging afterwards more effectual remedies neceſſary, it conſents to the Treaty of the League with <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> deeming it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for <hi>Italy,</hi> a ſtrengthening to the common Liberty, a ſafety to the Contractors, and at leaſt alſo of good example to the Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> and ſends Ambaſſadour Extraordinary to <hi>Rome</hi> (for <hi>Nani</hi> had obtained his diſcharge) <hi>Angelo Contarini</hi> Cavalier Procurator with powers to treat and conclude it. But at the firſt entrance weighty difficulties and many delays were met with; ſo that <hi>Caſal</hi> could hardly have been preſerved, if from the Bravery and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of the Count of <hi>Harcourt</hi> more ſpeedy remedies had not been applied. The Siege drew out into a greater length than had been imagined by the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> the Intelligences in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle vnaiſhing, and among the Inhabitants the natural averſion to the name <hi>Spaniard</hi> prevailing more than their inclination to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:53750:246"/>
                  <hi>Roſſignano</hi> withal defended it ſelf bravely. Nevertheleſs <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Ferragalli</hi> propoſing to him a ſuſpenſion of Arms for a month, rejects it, not without upbraiding the Pope, that he aimed to give the <hi>French</hi> time to come to its ſuccours. <hi>Harcourt</hi> in the mean time haſtily aſſembling the moſt of the <hi>Savoyards</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Troops that he could, advances towards <hi>Caſal</hi> with ſeven thouſand Foot, three thouſand five hundred Horſe, and ten pieces of Cannon, in hopes that the Quarters of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being unfortified, and at a great diſtance from one another, either they would be obliged to abandon ſome of their Poſts, or keeping them all, would leave them weak. <hi>Leganes</hi> underſtanding the <hi>French</hi> were marching, intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the approaches, applies himſelf to finiſh the Circumvallation; but at their arrival all being imperfect, he was beyond meaſure in diſorder. <hi>Harcourt</hi> ſhewing his Army the place, as a fatal and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Trophy of the <hi>French</hi> Arms, makes choice to aſſault that part, where the <hi>Gattola</hi> hath its courſe. There were certain command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hillocks, which <hi>Leganes</hi> would not comprehend within his Line, by reaſon of the largeneſs of the compaſs, and that he believed them for the dirt and mire not climable by an Enemy, much leſs for Cannon. He had only raiſed there certain Redoubts, which <hi>Harcourt</hi> cauſed to be inveſted by ſome Troops, that they might be no hindrance of his advancing with the body; and then ſurmounting all difficulty of the way or ſituation, plants a Battery on the higheſt part, with which playing upon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Souldiers that were in the Trenches, he forced them to retire. Putting then himſelf at the head of certain ſelect Troops, he in a trice forced his paſſage into the Camp on that ſide which is called <hi>Saint George,</hi> while at the ſame time the Marqueſſes, <hi>Villa</hi> and <hi>Pianezza,</hi> with the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> and <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieurs de Pleſſis Praſlin</hi> and <hi>la Mothe Houdancourt</hi> with the <hi>French</hi> made their attacques in ſeveral other places.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> making a looſe fight and divided, made but a ſhort reſiſtance. Their Horſe firſt taking the flight, attempted after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in vain to make a ſtand. The <hi>Germans</hi> laboured to ſtop the Enemy a while, and <hi>Leganes</hi> ran from place to place to give courage to the Fugitives, and redreſs the confuſion. But the <hi>French</hi> in a well cloſed order gave them neither time nor breath to recover themſelves. So that only <hi>Gatta, Sotello, Batteville,</hi> and <hi>Leganes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, joyning themſelves together with ſome Troops that remained, night coming upon them, and not being purſued, concluded it beſt to retire towards <hi>Brem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſal</hi> being in this manner not only ſuccoured, but ſet at liberty, and the Enemies Army ſcattered, there remained to <hi>Harcourt</hi> ſo clear a Victory, that, (which ſeldom happens) both the Conquerours and conquered agree in the celebrating of it. The ſlain on the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſide were not above three thouſand; but the flight being greater than the ſlaughter, the diſbanding of the Army was moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Beſides many Priſoners, the Cannon, the Money, the Spoils, and the very Writings remained to the <hi>French,</hi> who amongſt them found the Original of the Treaty, formerly concluded by <hi>Saiavedra</hi>
                  <pb n="479" facs="tcp:53750:246"/>
with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mantua.</hi> This ſucceſs freed <hi>Italy</hi> a while from preſent apprehenſions. Nevertheleſs the Treaty of the League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Pope and the <hi>Venetians</hi> continued for ſome time, nay ſome Articles were agreed on; <hi>That for common defence an Army ſhould be raiſed to take the field when there ſhould be occaſion, of twelve thouſand Foot and three thouſand Horſe, with a proportionable number of Cannon. Of the Foot ſeven thouſand ſhould be allotted to the Republick with two thirds of the Cavalry and Cannon. The obligation of reciprocal aſſiſtance ſhould then have place, when to one of the Confederates War ſhould be either denounced, or his Country invaded. In which caſe ſeaſonable diverſions ſhould alſo be made by Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the Charge of General of the Army, with deſign to advantage the Family, and to let it fall upon the Prefect, the <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins</hi> preſſed much, and the Republick at laſt conſented, that the Army coming to joyn, the Pope with their good liking ſhould name him. Theſe things being agreed, the Senate deſired that the Treaty ſhould be publiſhed, leaving ſome other points of leſſer importance to be afterwards diſcuſſed; for, as the <hi>Venetians</hi> underſtood, that in caſe of defence all the temporal Dominion which the Church poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed was to be comprehended, ſo the Popes Miniſters pretended to compriſe the Fiefs which held of the ſame. This ſeemed to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a point of a deeper root, becauſe it might happen, that the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berins</hi> would involve the Republick in their deſigns upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> where it was ſuſpected that the <hi>French</hi> were parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipant of the Intelligences they held there; but time a while after manifeſted, that they rather aimed to ingage the Republick to joyn in, or at leaſt not diſturb, the reſentments, which from this preſent they deſigned againſt the Duke of <hi>Parma.</hi> Whereupon the Senate, having endeavoured with many reaſons to diſſwade the Pope from it, but in vain, recalled their powers, not to leave any longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending a buſineſs of that import, which was very irkſom to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and the motive of the extraordinary Ambaſſage coming withal to ceaſe, <hi>Contarini</hi> was recalled to <hi>Venice.</hi> And now the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, conceived from the deſigns of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into amazement at the courage of the <hi>French;</hi> for that <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> with ten thouſand men only, had undertaken the Siege of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> with a vaſt Circumvallation, after he had poſſeſſed the Bridge upon the <hi>Po,</hi> the Convent of the Capucins, and the Poſt of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino.</hi> The City was guarded by above three thouſand Souldiers with Prince <hi>Thomaſo,</hi> beſides a good number of Inhabitants well trained to Arms. The Undertaking therefore was held impoſſible to be effected, and ſo it would have been, if the conſtancy and valour of <hi>Harcourt</hi> had not with equal glory undertook and finiſhed; it not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he was ſeveral times rather in the condition of one beſieged than of a beſieger, and that he was believed over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at the ſame time that he appeared triumphant.</p>
               <p>The Siege laſting ſeveral months, in that while was quieted in <hi>France</hi> a dangerous Inſurrection in <hi>Normandy,</hi> which, though com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of the common ſort of people, yet received incouragement
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:53750:247"/>
both from the cauſe, which was the impoſitions, and from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which gave a reputation no leſs than authority to it. The people exclaimed, that <hi>Richelieu,</hi> making advantage of the publick evils, was Author of the War and Inventor of the Impoſts, with the wonted deſtiny of Favourites, who being conſidered burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom in War and offenſive in Peace, are in either fortune either of proſperity or adverſity with deteſtation abhorred: But he ſending Monſieur <hi>de Gaſſion</hi> with Souldiers, and the Chancellor with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, diſſipated the revolt, many being puniſhed, all defeated, and the Parliament interdicted for a time. The inteſtine Peace of the Kingdom facilitated the progreſs of Arms elſewhere; for <hi>Arras</hi> was beſieged by the Mareſchals <hi>Chaune, Chaſtillon,</hi> and <hi>la Mailleray,</hi> with a very puiſſant Army. The Town was found in a manner unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the <hi>French</hi> by feigned marches having not only miſled the Enemy to other places, but induced the Governour, who was the Count of <hi>Iſemberg,</hi> to go out of it to provide for places elſewhere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arras</hi> is the Metropolis of <hi>Artois,</hi> a populous and great City, well fortified, and ſo ſituate, that two Cities ſeem invironed by one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure. The <hi>French</hi> plant their Camp there, and intrench them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a ſtrong circumvallation, foreſeeing that the weaker the defence within was, the greater effort would be made by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for its relief. Accordingly <hi>Philippo di Silva</hi> with part of the Army draws near to it, and a while after the Cardinal <hi>Infante</hi> joins with him, notwithſtanding that <hi>Orange,</hi> threatning many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, kept a body of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army in a perpetual diſtraction. The <hi>Infante</hi> ſucceeded in hindring Victuals from the <hi>French</hi> Camp, ſo that King <hi>Lewis,</hi> who with the Cardinal was at <hi>Amiens,</hi> was forced to break through with great ſtore of Proviſions, under a Convoy of ten or twelve thouſand men haſtily aſſembled, part the Militia of the Country, and of the Kings Guards, part of the Nobleſs, who from the Neighbouring Provinces, to pleaſe the King and the Miniſter, flocked thither in great numbers. It was concerted by the <hi>French,</hi> that at the ſame time that the Convoy approached <hi>Chaune</hi> and <hi>la Mailleray</hi> ſhould be out of the Camp to ſecure its paſſage.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, among the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commanders there was dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in opinion, ſome judging to go and meet the Convoy to be the beſt way to hinder it; others, that they ſhould aſſault the Trenches, when they were weakned; and this counſel, as moſt ſpecious, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. Whereupon, when the two Mareſhals were gone at a good diſtance, the Camp was aſſaulted, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entring into it in ſeveral parts, and poſſeſſing ſome Poſts. But <hi>la Mailleray,</hi> having with great expedition brought the Convoy into ſafety, returns ſo ſeaſonably, that, the Fight yet laſting, he conſtrained the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to retire, and abandon all they had gotten. The ſurrender of the place followed a while after, the <hi>French</hi> Colours entring into it the tenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to the exceeding glory of their Arms, and as much conſternation to the Country round about. King <hi>Lewis</hi> thinking to have reaped an abundant Harveſt from this Compagnia, returns to <hi>Paris,</hi> where, with increaſe of felicity, he was enriched

               <p>Good fortune carrying always its ſting with it, ſo many proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to <hi>France</hi> begat in ſome envy, in others jealouſie, in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> particularly through neighbourhood and emulation. About this time the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> looked with no leſs ſuſpicions upon the progreſs of the <hi>Swedes;</hi> whereupon the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> believing the occaſion proper to ſtrengthen their party, the Emperour ſent the Count <hi>Curtius</hi> into <hi>Denmark</hi> to propound Leagues and Concerts; and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> diſpatched the Marqueſſes of <hi>Vellada</hi> and <hi>Malvez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zi</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> to inſinuate marriages of King <hi>Charles</hi> his eldeſt Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> and reciprocally of the <hi>Infanta</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> But the Senate of that Kingdom oppoſed the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s inclination, and that of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a general revolt of the <hi>Scotch,</hi> to whom the King had attempted to propoſe a certain form of Ceremonies and Prayers, which were rejected by all ſorts of perſons in an open tumult. It was believed that <hi>Richelieu</hi> ſecretly fomented thoſe ſtirs, either becauſe he truly intended it, to break thoſe ſo jealous Negotiations with <hi>Spain,</hi> or becauſe it was thought, that he, being in this Age (ſo to call it) the Intelligence of the world, had an influence in all great buſineſſes, either by aſſiſtance or counſel.</p>
               <p>Sure it is, that it ſeemed as if Fortune applied her ſelf to nothing elſe but to promote his advantages, and very often anticipate his very deſigns, and on the other ſide to confound and diſturb thoſe of the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke; as if from the antipathy of theſe two great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters proceeded the diſcord of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the diſparity of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents was alſo occaſioned. Not long after the rendring of <hi>Arras</hi> happens that of <hi>Turin,</hi> where the Siege remained a long time by various accidents, and by the event was ennobled above any other whatſoever. <hi>Harcourt</hi> had no ſooner intrenched himſelf in the view of <hi>Turin,</hi> but he was forced to repulſe many ſallies, and one in particular, which made a deep impreſſion into his Quarters. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Leganes</hi> ſhews himſelf behind him with twelve thouſand Foot and five thouſand Horſe, threatning to aſſault his Poſts and the Bridge; but having taken a view of the ſituation, and infeſted the Camp with ſome Cannon-ſhot, he turns to <hi>Moncalieri,</hi> to paſs the <hi>Po</hi> upon a Wooden Bridge which was there. But the <hi>French</hi> having broken it, he commands <hi>Carlo della Gatta</hi> to repair it, though he might with much eaſe have attempted a little higher to wade it. The <hi>French</hi> diſputed it, till at laſt Monſieur <hi>de Turain,</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, being hurt, and the skirmiſh ſlackning, certain little Iſlands a little lower were fortified by <hi>Gatta,</hi> under the covert whereof he lays over the Bridge. The Governour now paſſes over to the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purata,</hi> and ſends <hi>Gatta</hi> to <hi>Cologno,</hi> to cut off the ways, and hinder the <hi>French</hi> Army of ſuccours and victuals from the Mountains. <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> alſo to incommodate <hi>Turin,</hi> took away the uſe of the Mills, by diverting the <hi>Dora;</hi> but the beſieged reſtored it to its old courſe, and he at laſt beats them to pieces with his Cannon. But in the
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:53750:248"/>
Town they nevertheleſs ſupplied themſelves with inſtruments manual; on the other ſide in the Camp, the Souldiery was almoſt reduced to the extremity of hunger, there being a want, beſides that of Forrage for the Horſe, of bread and all ſort of other nouriſhment, except ſome little Pulſe, which was ſcantily given out to the Souldiers; and yet the Nation, though moſt impatient of ſuffering, ſuffered every thing, the General keeping it by his dexterity in Diſcipline, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging it with good words and liberal promiſes. Nor could <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> be poſſibly put to a harder pinch; for the diſhonour of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat between the Jaws of the Enemy was conſidered as the leaſt loſs; and to perſiſt amidſt ſo many ſufferings, could not merit other commendation than that of an abſolute reſolution to periſh. But having to feed the Army, the Citadel of <hi>Turin</hi> and the Town of <hi>Chivas</hi> being disfurniſht of Victuals, nothing remained for him but to abandon by a ſecret flight every thing in prey to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or by a forced accord to deliver them the Keys of <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſafety came from the Enemy themſelves; for the Prince and Governour diſagreeing not only in Opinions, but alſo in Maxims and Intereſts, the one would overcome with longer, but more cautious, counſels, and the other preſſed, that all things ſhould be haſtened, and to his inſtances joyning threatnings and proteſts, that if in four days the place were not relieved, and the Enemy driven away, he would capitulate the Surrender, and withal make his own accord. <hi>Leganes</hi> believing too much, becauſe he feared too much, reſolves upon a general aſſault, in concert with the Prince, in ſo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the <hi>French,</hi> now but few, and they tired out, ſhould not be able to reſiſt in all, and the deſign without doubt would have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, if the execution had been as well performed, as the counſel was moſt excellently ordered. But of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Chiefs that were to command the attacques, ſome arrived at the Poſts aſſigned to them too late, others made their aſſault faintly, and ſome not at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leganes,</hi> coming to <hi>Harcourts</hi> Quarter at the time that the Prince having made his attempt was retired, thought fit to forbear, only <hi>Carlo della Gatta,</hi> at the ſide of the <hi>Purpurata,</hi> broke into a <hi>French</hi> Quarter; but his Foot ſtopping there to pillage the Huts, fell into ſuch a confuſion, that from plunder they eaſily betook themſelves to flight; for the <hi>French</hi> gotten again into order, recovered an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment and a Fort, preſſing upon <hi>Gatta,</hi> who with two thouſand Horſe, interrupted on his way by many Trees cut down, advanced ſlowly. Prince <hi>Thomaſo</hi> making a Sally, diſ-ingaged him, and brought him into <hi>Turin,</hi> where he ſerved but for a burden and ruine, conſuming for man and horſe all that which preſerved the place. On the other ſide, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Camp weakned in Horſe, and <hi>Gatta</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving abandoned <hi>Cologno,</hi> from which ſide Convoys to the Camp were more eaſily hindred than from any other, <hi>Turenne</hi> brought in one ſo plentiful, that it notably refreſhed the Army. The ſtate of things then changing, diſagreement alſo increaſed betwixt the Prince and the Governour, they reproaching one another either with ſlackneſs or over-much raſhneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="483" facs="tcp:53750:248"/>
                  <hi>Leganes</hi> repaſſing the <hi>Po,</hi> returns to his firſt Poſts of the Hills, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the paſſage of the Mountains open to the <hi>French,</hi> and he would have gone much further off, if the Prince had not threatned him to ſurrender, if he did not provide him with powder and meal. <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> made ſeveral attempts to put ſome in, but always in vain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Harcourt,</hi> having ſtraightned the firſt circumference of his Lines, kept them with great care. Worthy of notice was the Invention of <hi>Franceſco Zignoni,</hi> of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> who, having added force to the Mortar-pieces that are uſed in the caſting of Bombes, flung ſome Bullets not only with Letters, but with Powder and Meal, flying through the Air, into the Town, or near to the Wall, the <hi>French</hi> wondring at it, and confeſſing, by not being able to hinder it, that the Element of the Air is moſt free from the command and violence of man. Nevertheleſs the artifice was rather eſteemed than the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours proportionable; for beſides the great charge the quantity did not ſupply the need. They reſolved therefore in <hi>Turin,</hi> that <hi>Gatta</hi> ſhould again force a paſſage to return to <hi>Leganes.</hi> The Prince for a diverſion made a real attacque at one ſide. <hi>Carlo</hi> forces the Lines on the other; but encountring much water, being that of the <hi>Dora,</hi> which, deturned by the <hi>French,</hi> flowed into the Meadows, while he was in trouble to find a Ford, being charged by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, was forced to return to <hi>Turin.</hi> It was then perceived, that Force elſewhere was neceſſary, and the Prince invited and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Governour to a new attempt, offering himſelf to aſſault and poſſeſs certain Forts betwixt the <hi>Capucins</hi> and <hi>Valentino,</hi> and the Governour then to make an aſſault on his ſide alſo. <hi>Thomaſo</hi> failed not either in courage or ſucceſs, for he attacqued and took thoſe Poſts; but he either dead or run away, who with certain Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works was to have given the ſign of it to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour ignorant of the ſucceſs ſtands ſtill, and the Prince after having ſtayed a good while, leaving his Conqueſts, retired. In the mean while <hi>Harcourt</hi> increaſed daily in Forces; for on the Fame of ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Siege many Volunteers flocked from the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and ſix thouſand Souldiers at twice with much proviſion were brought by the Marqueſs of <hi>Villeroy,</hi> Governour of <hi>Lions,</hi> and by <hi>Monſieur Caſtellan.</hi> Inceſſant then were the Skirmiſhes, Sallies, and Attacques; but at laſt Victuals, Forrage, and Money wanting, the conditions being agreed, <hi>Turin</hi> on the 24. of <hi>September</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the <hi>French,</hi> and the Duke and Regent re-eſtabliſhed there.</p>
               <p>The Prince going forth, concluded for himſelf a Truce for certain days, within which his adjuſtment was to be treated, and he retired to <hi>Inurea,</hi> refuſing (to advantage himſelf by playing a middle Game betwixt the Flatteries and Jealouſies of both the Crowns,) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever advantages was offered him by the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> and hearkening to the propoſitions of accord, which by <hi>Julio Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi> ſent expreſly for that affair by <hi>Richelieu</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him in the Name of King <hi>Lodowick.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> then oppoſing other offers to the progreſs of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> he ratifies a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:53750:249"/>
Writing agreed by his Wife in <hi>Spain,</hi> in which he ſubmitted himſelf and his houſe to the protection of that Crown. To this he feigns to <hi>Mazarine</hi> to have been induced from the deſire of reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Wife and Sons detained at <hi>Madrid.</hi> And with the ſaid <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi> the better to deceive him, concludes a while after a Treaty, in which he obliges himſelf; <hi>To come the beginning of the next year to</hi> Paris; <hi>to require of the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>beſides his Wife and Sons, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of places to his Nephew, and not obtaining it to procure it joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with</hi> France <hi>by Arms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King on the other ſide promiſed, <hi>To take the Garriſons out of thoſe places, which he held in depoſito, when</hi> Spain <hi>ſhould alſo render the places it had gained. Concerning the Succeſſion, if it ſhould happen the Duke ſhould dye, he promiſed to protect the Right of the Princes, underſtanding thoſe, who ſhould be adhering to his Party. As for the reſt, to</hi> Thomaſo <hi>was left in Government that which he had in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent power for ſo long, till an agreement were made with his Nephew and Siſter-in-law, aſſigning great Penſions to himſelf, his Wife, and his Sons, for one of which, hopes were given him of a Marriage with the Daughter of the Duke of</hi> Longueville, <hi>endowed with great Riches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under the faith of this Treaty, which for the preſent required ſecrecy, the Truce was prolonged for all <hi>February</hi> of the next year. But amidſt the Negotiations of <hi>Italy,</hi> the hopes of the general Peace went in ſuch ſort backwards, that the Pope, weary of the Charge and the diſhonour of keeping a Legate idle in <hi>Collen,</hi> recalls him, leaving for Nuntio Extraordinary <hi>Signor Macchiavelli,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to whom <hi>Roſſetti</hi> a while after was ſubſtituted. Theſe diſcompoſures of the Treaty roſe chiefly from the revolts of <hi>Catalogna</hi> and of <hi>Portugal,</hi> which filling one ſide with great hopes and deſigns, and the other with perturbation of mind and perplexity, admitted not the appearance of any expedients to reconcile their minds and intereſts. It hath formerly been hinted, how <hi>Olivares</hi> with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power governed in <hi>Spain</hi> the King no leſs than his Dominions, with a Spirit highly elated, Maxims ſevere, and Counſels violent. He had propoſed to himſelf to exalt the Power and Glory of the King equal to the Title, which he had cauſed him to aſſume of <hi>Great;</hi> but Fortune with unhappy events ſeconded ſo ill his purpoſe, that the Splendour of the Crown ſeemed in a great meaſure dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Whereupon among Strangers there was a relaxation of that awe, which riſing from power was wont to keep them in reſpect; and in the mind of the Subjects, accuſtomed under the vail of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and proſperity to venerate as infallible the <hi>Arcana</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, entred contempt and hatred towards the King and his Favourite.</p>
               <p>The deſign of <hi>Olivares</hi> was manifeſt, not only to enlarge the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy beyond its firſt Confines, but in the Kingdoms themſelves to eſtabliſh the abſolute Authority of a Monarch, who in ſome of the Provinces, circumſcribed by Laws, Conceſſions and Covenants, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed precarious, and that he enjoyed rather the name than the force of Dominion. That which urged him to this, was chiefly the want
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:53750:249"/>
of money and men, to ſupply ſo many foreign Wars; for being to depend upon the conſent of the people, proviſions came not to be furniſhed equal to the neceſſity, nor ready for the urgency. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought to aboliſh or at leaſt to reſtrain ſo great a liberty, which ſome attributed to themſelves, and principally the <hi>Catalans,</hi> who provided with no ſmall priviledges, and free from many burdens, kept their Liberty with no leſs zeal, than their Religion. The King being ſome years ſince with the Court at <hi>Barcellona,</hi> they ſeveral times oppoſed <hi>Olivares</hi> his demands; whereat he being irritated, nouriſhed ever after in his mind thoughts to chaſtiſe and humble them. The Kings, to ſay truth, were wont to bear reſpect to that Nation, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant by Nature, and for the ſituation important; becauſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, if from the Sea-Coaſt, by reaſon it hath no Harbours, it be impenetrable, on the Land ſide it ſeems inacceſſible by reaſon of the Mountains; and they piercing deeply inwards, and being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into many branches, form themſelves into as many Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, within which are comprehended ſtrong places, populous Cities, Towns, and a great number of Villages; ſo that the whole Province may be reſembled to one mighty Baſtion defended with ſeveral cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of retreats. The Neighbourhood then to <hi>France,</hi> the Paſſes of the <hi>Pirenean,</hi> the largeneſs of the Circuit, the population and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial inclination of the Inhabitants, made it conſidered, and little leſs than feared.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the <hi>Condé</hi> Duke buſied his thoughts for an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to bridle it; but when he thought that Fortune had opened the way to it, he was not aware, that it carried along with it a down-fal to the greatneſs and ſafety of all <hi>Spain.</hi> We have formerly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, how <hi>Richelieu,</hi> tempting the Confines on that ſide, hoped to promote accidents, and particularly to irritate the mind of the people amidſt the inconveniencies of War, and the miſchiefs of Arms; and ſo it punctually fell out. For <hi>Salſes</hi> being loſt, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> to recover it, were forced to plant their place of Arms in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogna,</hi> and when they had taken it, left the Army to quarter there; ſo that, if during the Siege the Province was grievouſly afflicted by the paſſages of the Souldiery, that people felt afterwards their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe ſo much more intolerable, as they had not been accuſtomed to it. Nothing was heard of but extortions and oppreſſions, Churches profaned, Women raviſhed, goods taken by violence; to which exceſſes the Chiefs making no reparation, an opinion was raiſed, that <hi>Olivares,</hi> to impoſe under the title of neceſſary defence the yoak upon that Province, willingly ſuffered it. Sure it is, that the Count of <hi>Saint Coloma,</hi> the Vice-Roy, inſtigated by frequent Letters from him, to draw men and money from that Province, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the countenance of the Army, without ſticking at their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and expecting the conſent of the States, ſeized in <hi>Barcelona</hi> upon certain money, which belonged to the diſpoſal of the City, and becauſe one of the Jurates (the moſt conſiderable Magiſtrate) oppoſed ſo great a Licenſe, and inſiſted, that the extravagances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Souldiery might be puniſhed, he impriſoned him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="486" facs="tcp:53750:250"/>This was enough to put a people into commotion, which ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obedience, but was not yet acquainted with ſlavery. Arms were taken, the Priſons opened, a torrent of people in the Streets, with ſo great and univerſal a tumult, that the Vice-Roy, frighted, thought his ſafety only placed in running away. He therefore gets into the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> where being as little ſecure; (for the people putting fire to the Pallace ſought him over all,) he cauſed a Galley to come near the ſhoar; but while he was going to the Sea ſide to imbarque, being overtaken by the Mutineers, was killed. The people now, partly terrified by their own exceſs, partly inveigled and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amidſt the apprehenſions of ſlavery and the appearances of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, judged, that there was no place left for repentance, nor for the Kings clemency. Shaking off the yoak then, they ran out into extremities, and the confuſion being not able to ſubſiſt of it ſelf, an independent Government was formed, with a Council of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, joined to the other ancient Magiſtrates of the City. Upon ſuch an example almoſt all the Country fell into a commotion, and the Towns and Villages univerſally taking Arms, killed and forced to fly all thoſe that were native <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The mind of the <hi>Condé</hi> Duke at ſo unexpected an accident being greatly diſordered, he neither durſt make it known to the King, nor could it be concealed. He endeavours to make him believe, that it was nothing but a popular tumult, which would vaniſh of it ſelf, or being quickly appeaſed by force, would contribute to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the authority of the Government more reſpected; for by Arms the Rebellion would not only be quieted, but the pride of the <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans</hi> brought down, and thoſe priviledges aboliſhed, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them contumacious. But reflecting in his mind with more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret cares upon the importance of the Province, the quality of the ſituation, and thoſe greater miſchiefs, whilſt the <hi>French</hi> would be brought in there, he weighed within himſelf, which, either artifice or force, might more profitably be employed. Nor was he free from doubt, leſt other Kingdoms, eſpecially <hi>Arragon,</hi> might follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. He firſt trys, by the perſwaſions of the old <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Cardona,</hi> who with the people of <hi>Barcelona</hi> had much veneration and authority, and by the means of the Miniſter of the Pope who reſided there, to pacifie their minds and quiet the tumult; and that not ſucceeding to advantage, he reſolves to uſe force with ſuch power and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that the people ſhould neither be able to reſiſt, nor the <hi>French</hi> arrive time enough for their relief. He then goes about to aſſemble the Army; commanding the Fee-Farmers, and inviting the Nobility, and among them, many of the moſt ſuſpected, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> that they might ſerve for Hoſtages, as well as Souldiers. But the Proviſions could not be ſo ſoon ready, but that the <hi>Catalans</hi> had time to provide themſelves with much reſolution, and to ſend Deputies into <hi>France</hi> to demand aſſiſtance. It is not to be ſaid, with what ſatisfaction <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who had formerly with his wonted arts nouriſhed their firſt diſpoſitions, entertained them. He heaps honours upon them, and loads them with promiſes; but at
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:53750:250"/>
the ſame time willing to make uſe of the occaſion, which chance of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him, he not only contrived to nouriſh War in the bowels of <hi>Spain,</hi> but to reduce <hi>Catalogna</hi> to a neceſſity of rendring themſelves to the ſubjection of the <hi>French.</hi> He ſends Monſieur <hi>de St. Paul</hi> with ſome few Officers, and by Sea ſome Souldiers and Cannon, to the end that that people might take heart to blood themſelves with the <hi>Caſtiglians;</hi> and diſpatches Monſieur <hi>de Pleſſis Beſanzon,</hi> an eloquent Miniſter and a witty man, to diſcover the diſpoſition of affairs and minds.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Olivares</hi> having gotten the Army together, which amounted to thirty thouſand Combatants, the command thereof was committed to the Marqueſs <hi>de los Velez,</hi> by birth a <hi>Catalan,</hi> and deſtined to be Vice-Roy of the Province, towards which it was ſo far from his having any diſpoſition of affection, that he rather had cauſes of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and deteſtation, the people in <hi>Barcelona</hi> having razed his houſe and confiſcated his goods. In the month of <hi>December</hi> be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins his march from <hi>Tortoſa,</hi> a City participant in the Rebellion; but which, either by the inclination of the Inhabitants, or for fear of the Army, was the firſt that reſtored it ſelf to obedience. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to <hi>Balaguer;</hi> many Towns, not able for defence, rendring themſelves every where. And there though the ſtraits of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes might have been defended by a few, yet the Guards of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talans</hi> durſt not expect him; whereupon the Marqueſs, breathing terrour and ſeverity, proceeds as far as <hi>Combriel,</hi> the Mutineers place of Arms. The place, though weak, deſpiſing the conditions, which to disband the people in it the Marqueſs offered, had the boldneſs to hold out five days, after which, being willing to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſelf, it was not received but at diſcretion, the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid waſte, the Magiſtrates hanged, and the Souldiers cut to pieces.</p>
               <p>From this blood was hatched deſpair over all: In <hi>Barcelona</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Citizens animated one another, to undergo all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, rather than fall into the hand or under the Government of ſo arrogant a Conquerour, or a Vice-Roy, become ſo cruel. Entring into conſideration of their liberty and ſafety, order was taken for the defence, fortifying <hi>Mongiovino,</hi> and, uniting their minds for the common danger, they went on in the Government and in their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions with vigour and concord. They nevertheleſs feared they ſhould not be able to withſtand ſo powerful a ſhock, without a ſtrong ſupport. That apprehenſion was fomented by the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, who repreſented to them imminent ruine on one ſide, and ſuccours at hand on the other. But demonſtrating that it was not reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Crown, to procure anothers advantage, ſhould aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don its own, they inſinuated amidſt fears and diſcourſes, how much it belonged to them to oblige ſo great a King to ſupport, both for honour and intereſt, that Principality. The deſign took; for the fear of the danger and the hopes of ſuccours induced the <hi>Catalans</hi> to deliver themſelves up to the protection and dominion of <hi>France,</hi> with many conditions, which preſerved their priviledges, thoſe
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:53750:251"/>
eſpecially of the conſent of the people in the laying on of Impoſts, the Collation of Church-benefices, and temporal Charges on thoſe of the Nation, except the Supreme of Viceroy, who might be a Stranger. To this all gave their aſſent. The major part out of a deſire of novelty; the ſimple out of a conceit to change their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the better; the more wiſe for being aware, that after the firſt ſteps of Rebellion, whatſoever liberty or ſervitude was to be, it could not be enjoyed but with the ſame ruine and calamity.</p>
               <p>This happened about the laſt days of the year, very near the time that <hi>Portugal</hi> alſo, caſting off the yoke, revived with a new King the ancient name of a Kingdom. The emulation, which is betwixt the <hi>Caſtiglians</hi> and the <hi>Portuguais,</hi> is natural, being imprinted by birth, nouriſhed by the milk, and tranſmitted as an Inheritance from their Anceſtors, but was now rather become an abhorrency and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, after theſe were forced to bend their necks under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Caſtiglians.</hi> The <hi>Portuguais</hi> had ſeveral times applied their attentions and hope to various accidents, which might give a change to their preſent Fortune; but the potency and felicity of the <hi>Caſtiglians</hi> had till now either kept off foreign deſigns, or prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe at home.</p>
               <p>The deſire nevertheleſs greatly increaſed, and the conſideration of the Dukes of <hi>Braganza</hi> ſerved to provoke it, who deſcending from <hi>Edward,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Henry,</hi> were by many as much preferred in their Right, as they had been forced to ſubmit to the Force of King <hi>Philip.</hi> The preſent Duke <hi>John,</hi> obſerving that the <hi>Caſtiglians</hi> had a waking eye upon him, ſhewed himſelf ſo much the more averſe from all application and buſineſs; and a Tumult in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain City having happened ſome years paſt, upon the hearing of his name called upon, he had contained himſelf within ſuch a modeſty, that he was believed equally averſe from ambition and deceit. <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares</hi> conſidering the Rights of the Houſe and the Favour of the People, beſides his Riches and Lordſhips, which exceeded the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Vaſſal, to ſecure himſelf of him, invites him to the Court with rewards and imployments, and with a diſſembled confidence conferred upon him Charges and Titles, which, it was believed, tended not to adorn him with Dignity, but to expoſe him to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to the end, that exerciſing particularly his imployment of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtable, he ſhould be obliged to go upon the Fleet, or enter into ſome of the Fortreſſes, where they ſhould by ſecret orders to arreſt him Priſoner. <hi>Giovanni</hi> with ſeveral excuſes avoiding his going to <hi>Madrid,</hi> governed himſelf with ſuch reſerves in general, that, though he could not avoid the ſuſpicions of others, he at leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his own hazards. <hi>Olivares</hi> makes uſe of the Revolt of <hi>Catalogna</hi> and of the report that the King would go forth in perſon to quell it, to invite the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Nobility, and amongſt them with greater earneſt <hi>Braganza,</hi> to aſſiſt with his perſon, and with Forces in ſo ſignal an occaſion. But the ſame conjuncture ſerved the <hi>Portuguais</hi> to awaken in them their thoughts of old; ſo that many in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate converſations, accuſtomed frequently to lament, that a famous
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:53750:251"/>
Kingdom extended to the four Quarters of the World,<label type="milestone">

Then paſſing from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the times to the reproach of themſelves, as if in the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guais</hi> were wanting that Courage and Spirit, which ſo highly enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the people of <hi>Catalogna.</hi> They diſcourſed of the eaſineſs to accompliſh any great attempt, being governed by a Woman and by a hated Miniſter, with few Garriſons and leſs Proviſions, at a time, that all <hi>Spain</hi> was in diſorder, the Forces diſtracted, the King not able to reſiſt in ſo many places, and <hi>France</hi> ready to aſſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Margaret, Infanta</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> bore the Title of Vice-Queen: The Government therefore reſided in certain <hi>Caſtiglians,</hi> and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar the Secretary <hi>Vaſconcellos,</hi> who aſſiſted her, and who, being a Confident of <hi>Olivares,</hi> and raiſed by his favour, drew all to his Maxims to bring down the Great Ones, and exerciſe an abſolute Command. By the Conjunctures it truly appeared, that as to an Inſurrection the danger was greater in diſcovering their thoughts, than in putting them in execution; whereupon certain of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles meeting in the Garden <hi>d' Autan d' Almeda</hi> in <hi>Lisbon,</hi> there was one who conſiderately ſhewed; <hi>That the wearineſs and weight of the preſent yoke was now more grievous than the fear of future dangers. That the Government of the</hi> Caſtiglians, <hi>diſtruſtful and ſevere, did not think it ſelf otherwiſe ſecure, but in the hardeſt ſervitude of its Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals; that at laſt that time appeared, implored by their Fathers with ſighs, and wiſhed for by themſelves with ſo much longing. Why ſhould any more time be loſt? Are then the</hi> Portuguais <hi>leſs vigilant to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for liberty, than the</hi> Caſtiglians <hi>were ſolicitous to introduce Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny?

               <p>All being inflamed with this diſcourſe, gave mutually the hand and promiſe of ſecrecy, and never to abandon one another. They were in ſome perplexity about reſolving, what form they were to make choice of for the new Government. Some, by the example of the <hi>Catalans,</hi> were pleaſed with the Orders of the Republicks;
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:53750:252"/>
for that the ſupreme Juriſdiction of the Laws,<label type="milestone">

But by the major part the confuſion was conſidered, which the innovation of Government carried with it, upon a Country accuſtomed to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement of one alone. They therefore inclined to <hi>Braganza,</hi> in whom, to juſtifie the cauſe and attract the people, concurred the moſt principal requiſites, both for right to the Kingdom, and for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Fortune. They then ſent ſeparately to him <hi>Pietro Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza</hi> and <hi>Giovanni Pinto Ribero,</hi> to repreſent to him the unanimous Suffrage, and offer him the Scepter, and becauſe theſe perceived, that amidſt the Dukes various thoughts, the appearances of many dangers would repreſent themſelves to him, they endeavoured to clear all doubts, and <hi>il Pinto</hi> particularly, mingling threatnings and proteſts with reaſons and perſwaſions, declares to him, that whether he would or no, he ſhould be proclaimed King, without that from his reluctancy, himſelf or others ſhould reap ought but greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of more certain ruine. The Duke at an object ſo great and ſudden as was the Crown ſtumbled in his thoughts; but his Wife, Siſter of the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> being of a high Spirit, made him take heart, reproaching him with meanneſs to prefer the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarineſs of Life before the Dignity of an Empire. Nor did the <hi>French,</hi> acceſſary to what was working, fail by ſecret Meſſengers to ſtrengthen and animate him, with large promiſes of aſſiſtance and favour, making him believe, that the Crown was to ſtand ſo much the more firm upon his head, as they let him ſee the others tottering upon that of King <hi>Philip.</hi> He then was perſwaded to give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and the time and manner was concerted for the declaring of it.</p>
               <p>Although in this buſineſs ſecrecy was the pledge of the ſucceſs, nevertheleſs notice of it being ſpread amongſt many, ſomething of it breathed out to the Vice-Queen, who failed not to advertiſe the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke ſeveral times of the diſcourſes and deſigns of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators. But he, accuſtomed to give credit to himſelf rather than to others, believed it too late. Upon the firſt then of <hi>December,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nobles being gone to the Palace, at the ſtriking nine a clock in the morning, which was the ſign agreed upon, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a Piſtol diſcovered their Arms, and charged the Guards of the Vice-Queen, who unarmed and ſcattered, expecting nothing leſs, eaſily gave way. The Palace being poſſeſſed, the Nobles cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Liberty; crying up withal the name of <hi>John</hi> the Fourth for King; and others in the Market-places, ſome in the ſtreets, ſome from the Windows, among which was <hi>Michael Almeida,</hi> venerable for his white hairs, animating the people, and ſtirring them up to Arms, the concourſe was ſo great in a few minutes, that, as if the ſame Spirit moved the people, there was none that diſſented, or were wavering. One Company of <hi>Caſtiglians,</hi> that entred upon the

The <hi>Infanta,</hi> kept in the power of the Conſpirators, was uſed with much reſpect, and therefore obliged to command the Governour of the Caſtle to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſhoot with the Cannon, otherwiſe all the <hi>Caſtiglians</hi> in the City ſhould be cut in pieces. He not only obeys the order to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from doing harm, but immediately for fear or neceſſity makes haſte to render it, alledging to be ſo unprovided, that he could not have been able to reſiſt an aſſault of the people. It was a wonder to ſee a City, as <hi>Lisbone,</hi> great, populous, and in commotion, to ſetle in ſo ſhort a ſpace in its own power, but with ſo much order and ſilence, that no man commanding, all ſorts of perſons readily payed obedience to the name of the new King.</p>

The fame hereof being diſperſed through the Kingdom, every place haſted to follow the example, with ſo much unity of minds, that there appeared not to be a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Government, but only that the King had changed his name to the extraordinary joy of the people.

               <p>If upon the firſt invaſions on the Borders of the <hi>Pirenei</hi> it had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that <hi>Spain,</hi> empty of Victuals, money, and people, had ſcarce been able to make reſiſtance at home, greater evils were now preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, when ſo many Enemies diſcovered themſelves in its very bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. <hi>Olivares,</hi> perceiving that inſtead of promoting the Monarchy and the pre-eminence of power, it ſelf was forced to contend for its own ſafety, not being able to reſiſt in two places, ſtood in doubt, which
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:53750:253"/>
way he ſhould turn his chief cares and Forces. At laſt he judged it beſt to apply himſelf againſt <hi>Catalogna,</hi> hoping that the enterpriſe would not laſt long, and withal fearing, leſt with giving time the ſtrength of the Country, the fierceneſs of the people, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of the <hi>French,</hi> ſhould make it much more difficult. On the other ſide the Borders being open, aſſiſtances remote, the people leſs inured to War, and the whole Kingdom being to be conquered in <hi>Lisbon</hi> alone, he fancied to himſelf, that leaving the <hi>Portuguais</hi> in ſecurity and unmoleſted, they would have no care to ſtrengthen themſelves; and that the Nobles, proud by Nature, would not long ſuffer the command of one, envied by many, and equal to all. Nor would that thought perhaps have fallen out otherwiſe, if his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels had not always been fatally oppoſed by a certain diſaſter, which in ſome croſſed the opportunity, in others took away the force, and equally condemned all to moſt unhappy events. Then purſuing in <hi>Catalogna</hi> the War again in the Spring, <hi>Los Veles</hi> comes to the Siege of <hi>Tarragona,</hi> which, after the Metropolis of the Country, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for largeneſs and nobleneſs the chief place; but being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed but with an old Wall, though Monſieur <hi>d' Eſpenan</hi> with ſome <hi>French</hi> got into it, was quickly rendred, the relief availing nought but to capitulate under the name of the <hi>French</hi> ſafety alſo to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of life and goods. By this loſs the affairs and minds of the <hi>Catalans</hi> ſeemed much dejected, and, as it happens in improſperous events, betwixt them and the <hi>French</hi> paſſed words of reproach, <hi>they</hi> finding fault with the ſlenderneſs of the ſuccours, and <hi>theſe</hi> prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biating the baſeneſs of the reſiſtance. But <hi>Los Velez</hi> coming in ſight of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> againſt all his belief found the defence ſo reſolute and well ordered, and the <hi>Mongiovino,</hi> ſo well fortified, that not being able to take any one Fort, he retired, either for the rigour of the ſeaſon, or for the want of Victuals and Proviſions. It is not credible, how much the <hi>Catalans</hi> from this were animated, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the Kings diſpleaſure and arms, and ſeeing themſelves ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a more forcible pulſe of <hi>French</hi> arrived in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers under the command of Monſieur <hi>de la Mothe Houdancourt.</hi> He preſently beſieges <hi>Tarragona;</hi> but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were reſolved to ſuccour it at any rate, and the Duke <hi>de Ferandina</hi> with forty Gallies executes it, not without diſpute with the Naval Army of <hi>France,</hi> who having none but great Ships, and ſo not able to do much more than fulminate with the Cannon at random, effected nothing but that many of the Gallies taking fright did not adventure; ſo that eleven only made their paſſage through the Ships and Guns into the Port. The Town for all this could not hold out long, whereupon the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Fleet, augmented to ſeventy ſail, renews again the attempt with ſucceſs, and becauſe that of the <hi>French,</hi> through great negligence, ſuffered it ſelf to be ſurpriſed at Anchor, a great number of Barques and leſſer Veſſels entred into <hi>Terragona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> for this cauſe were obliged to remove, raiſing the Siege, and to raiſe the courage of the <hi>Catalans</hi> with ſomething of proſperous, advanced into <hi>Aragon,</hi> and took <hi>Tamarit,</hi> and ſuccouring
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:53750:253"/>
                  <hi>Almenas</hi> conſtrained the <hi>Caſtiglians,</hi> who had poſted their Camp there, to raiſe it. To open the Paſſes of the <hi>Pirenei</hi> for ſuccours, the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> entring into <hi>Roſſillion</hi> took there, <hi>Canet, Argiliers,</hi> and <hi>Elma.</hi> From theſe uncertainties in <hi>Catalogna</hi> the <hi>Portuguais</hi> made their advantage quietly, bringing their new Government into train, and ſtrengthening themſelves with foreign friendſhips. With <hi>France</hi> they renewed the former Treaties, with a liberty to the <hi>Portuguais</hi> to ſupply themſelves in that Kingdom, with Ammunition, Arms, and Men, and to ratifie them the Mareſhal <hi>de Brezé</hi> goes to <hi>Lisbon</hi> in great pomp, and with a numerous ſquadron of Ships, where he was received with a ſutable welcome and applauſe. The chief point agreed upon conſiſted, <hi>In arming forty Ships, to ply too and again in the Ocean, to interrupt the Navigation of the Indies, and lying in wait at Sea, to make prey of the</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Fleets and Treaſures. The</hi> Hollanders <hi>were to join twenty others:</hi> With whom a Truce alſo was ſtipulated by <hi>Portugal</hi> for ten years, with many Articles, which concerned Navigation and Trade, eſpecially in <hi>Braſil</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> it being agreed, That each ſhould remain poſſeſſed of what he held in thoſe parts, and endeavours be uſed to drive out the <hi>Spaniards</hi> every where: But that the Treaty, beyond the Equator, by reaſon of the diſtance, ſhould not take place till after a year.</p>
               <p>The United Provinces making uſe of this time with great artifice and much advantage, diſpatched with diligence orders to Count <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Naſſau,</hi> who commanded in <hi>Braſil,</hi> that he ſhould with all expedition make profit of the opportunity, as he did, by poſſeſſing on the Coaſt of <hi>Africa, San Paolo Loanda,</hi> with certain Iſlands, and places of great importance, to the great damage and bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the <hi>Portuguais,</hi> who nevertheleſs were forced to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it. But they now wanted not an inteſtine and perillous ſtorm. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Braga</hi> had in appearance adhered to the revolt; but conſerved in his heart a moſt partial affection for <hi>Caſtile,</hi> retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a confidence with <hi>Olivares,</hi> from whom he ſecretly received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations and incouragements. He communicates his thoughts to <hi>Lewis,</hi> Marqueſs <hi>de Villareal,</hi> and found him no leſs inclined; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon animating one another, the Marqueſs draws into them by force as it were of perſwaſions and by authority, the Duke <hi>de Camina,</hi> and the Marqueſs <hi>d' Armamar,</hi> the firſt his Son, and the other his Nephew. They agreed to kill upon the third of <hi>July,</hi> the King, the Queen, and their Sons, to ſet the City on fire in ſeveral places, and, if it could be compaſſed, the Ships alſo in the Port, to the end that the people being in confuſion, and diſtracted in ſeveral parts, and amazed, ſhould not mind ſuccouring the Kings Palace, nor to ſuppreſs the Conſpirators. Hereupon the Archbiſhop, a man of a majeſtical authority, with a Crucifix in his hand, was to cry up and perſwade obedience to <hi>Caſtigle.</hi> Nor were Troops to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a readineſs on the Confines, to be brought into thoſe places, where confuſion opened the Gates, or the conjuncture required. Treachery and Secrecy being for the moſt part incompatible, every thing was revealed to King <hi>John,</hi> and he, ſeemingly hiding it, calls a
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:53750:254"/>
Council, whereat the Conſpirators were preſent, and being come into the innermoſt Rooms of the Palace, cauſes them to be arreſted. The Archbiſhop was detained in Priſon, the others with publick puniſhment expiated the offence.</p>
               <p>The King with equal Art endeavoured to revenge himſelf of the <hi>Caſtiglians,</hi> tempting his Brother-in-law, the Duke of <hi>Medina Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> to revolt with <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> where he had good Credit and a great Eſtate. Nor ſhould his endeavours have wanted ſucceſs; for upon the invitations of the <hi>Portuguais</hi> and the inſinuations of <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> the Duke had lent his ear, and promiſed ſafe ſhelter to the Fleet of the Mareſhal <hi>de Brezé,</hi> under the countenance whereof he was to declare himſelf; but that the news coming of the relief of <hi>Terrago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and of the Siege raiſed, apprehending his own danger, he refuſes to receive the <hi>French</hi> Fleet into his Ports, and knowing, that <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vares</hi> had got knowledge of the Intelligence, to clear himſelf of it, he challenges the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to fight with him, reproaching him with the title of Traitor and Infamous. He then not having appeared, as was well to be ſuppoſed, in the field, he ſets upon his head a great ſum of money. But King <hi>Philip</hi> being therewith not contented, the Duke was ſummoned to Court, and he, not finding in <hi>Andaluzia</hi> an alienation to the <hi>Caſtiglians,</hi> nor for himſelf the favour he had hoped, obeys with ſo much readineſs, that he cauſed the firſt ſuſpicions to vaniſh, or at leaſt to be diſſembled.</p>
               <p>Whilſt <hi>Portugal</hi> eſtabliſhed it ſelf, and the Armies were contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Catalogna, Richelieu</hi> eaſily made himſelf believe, that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> would remain in prey to him; and in this puſh of Fortune every thing might have ſucceeded for him, if the courſe of his felicity had not been hindred in <hi>France</hi> it ſelf by very conſiderable accidents, though quickly and happily ſuppreſſed. It hath been ſaid elſewhere, that hatred againſt the Cardinal was with his proſperity increaſed, corrupt and diſcontented humours being now amaſſed to ſuch a degree, that the vigour of the Government, Reputation and Force it ſelf were found not ſufficient to digeſt and purge them. It was doubted, that the Duke of <hi>Vendoſm</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſome to kill him. Whether it were true or falſe, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal being in reputation to know every thing, and pardon nothing, the Duke paſſes into <hi>England,</hi> where the Queen-Mother as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, and thither repaired other diſſatisfied and ſuſpected perſons. The Parliaments of the Kingdom were alſo exaſperated, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that of <hi>Paris;</hi> for that having ſhewed a will to oppoſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Edicts, it had been ſeverely reproved by the King, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that for the future it ſhould not meddle in any thing that belonged to the Government.</p>
               <p>The people then in general, as they are wont to be the firſt to cry up Favourites, ſo being alſo the readieſt to execrate them, it cannot be ſaid, how much they abhorred the Name and Authority of this Miniſter. The Wars obliged to vaſt expences, and the Kings Revenues being ill managed, it was found, that the grievance aroſe from the publick want; for money being wanting in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:53750:254"/>
there was a neceſſity to take it by force from the rich, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort it with vexations from the poor. All ſeemed full of lamentations, but each one paſſed frequently under the accuſation of a Spy, tears going not unpuniſhed, and the very ſighs admitting of reproach Grief becoming at laſt too fierce could not be ſuppreſſed any longer with fear, and if talking and diſcourſes were forbidden and puniſhed, Writings and Pamphlets abounded, that filled all places with detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and invectives. There was raiſed at laſt a great ſtorm, and the body of it appeared aſſembled at <hi>Sedan,</hi> declared by the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who was Soveraign of it, the publick refuge of the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents. He was not ſatisfied with the Court, and to his diſguſts were quickly added thoſe alſo of others. The chief were the Count of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who framing to themſelves a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Commotion of the Kingdom, oppreſſed by the Cardinal with all ſorts of calamities, repreſented, <hi>His Miniſtry as the ſad Center of the common miſeries. He, Author of the War betwixt the Crowns, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a feigned luſtre of proſperity, kept the mind of the King bewitched; in the mean while extorted Treaſures, conſumed the ſpirits and the blood of the Kingdom, and to preſerve himſelf in this ambitious ſtation, kept himſelf environed with Armies. They deſcribed in him Cruelty and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice with equal horrour to have joyned hands to defend him from the threatnings which he inceſſantly feared. That nothing remained in</hi> France <hi>unviolated. That he had revenged himſelf of ſome of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with puniſhment; others, of the cleareſt innocency, were more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly made away. That many had been forced to ſeek their ſafety by retiring into other Countries, and that the Cardinal had either uſurped to himſelf, or diſtributed amongst his Kindred all their Charges, Goods, and Spoils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For theſe publick cauſes then, and to purge the Kingdom of a Monſter ſo hateful, who had either offended every body, or did threaten all with ruine, they gave it to be believed they had taken Arms, proteſting perfect obedience to the King. But other private motives, and perhaps more powerful, were not wanting. <hi>Soiſſons</hi> by reaſon of his generous and active Spirit was feared by the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and therefore, to bind him in the ſtrict bonds of confidence, he had tempted him to take one of his Nieces to Wife. But the Count publickly ſcorning the match, by reaſon of the inequality of birth, the Cardinal from his ambition falls into a hatred, and from hatred to meditate upon revenge, croſſing all his pretenſions with the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guiſe</hi> gave the Court that ſuſpicion which was inſeparable from the Houſe of <hi>Lorain,</hi> from whom he had taken away, with their Eſtates and Governments, all authority in <hi>France.</hi> He enjoyed the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Reims,</hi> with other benefices of the Church; and the Cardinal, deſirous to have the ſpoil of them, to impoveriſh him, aſſigns him a ſhort day, to enter into holy Orders, knowing, that being in love with <hi>Anna de Nevers,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Carlo</hi> the deceaſed Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> he aſpired rather to Marriage than the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: So that, not yielding obedience, he was deprived of the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:53750:255"/>
benefices, and reduced to a very narrow condition, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him to reſign any one of them to his Brothers. To ſtrengthen themſelves with foreign Forces, the ſaid Princes concluded a Treaty with <hi>Micael de Salamanca,</hi> who, in the name of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them a very great aſſiſtance of money and men, and that <hi>Lamboy</hi> with a good body of an Army ſhould come immediately to join with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Carlo</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> concurred in the ſame ſenſe, though in the beginning of the year being gone to <hi>Paris,</hi> he had agreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> party, and adhere ſincerely to <hi>France,</hi> by which a part of his Country was reſtored; <hi>Clermont,</hi> with <hi>Stenay, Dun,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> remaining in propriety to the Crown, and <hi>Nancy,</hi> till a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Peace, <hi>in depoſito.</hi> He, that had aimed at nothing but to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome places out of the hands of the <hi>French,</hi> having obtained his purpoſe, retires from the Court, and preſently begins to make Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies; yet making it believed, that he would join with the Mareſhal <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> for the ſervice of King <hi>Lewis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the revolt of the malecontents was rendred conſiderable by ſtranger Forces, and perhaps by an internal diſpoſition; it ſeeming to be without doubt, that, if the United Princes ſhould have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the firſt heat of ſome advantage to enter into the Kingdom, and ſhould have advanced into the Provinces, there would have followed a general commotion of the Gentry, Parliaments, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Neither was it without ſome appearance, but that to the King himſelf the exceſs of pride and predominancy of the Favourite growing troubleſom, ſome opportunity would have been accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be rid of him and diſgrace him. The Cardinal, ſometimes op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Counſel and ſometimes Force, took care for proviſions and for defence. He cloſes with the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> giving to his Son the Duke of <hi>Anguien</hi> one of his Nieces to Wife; for it highly concerned that Family to keep <hi>Soiſſons</hi> under, who had aſſumed the title of firſt Prince of the blood Royal; and ſends <hi>La Meilleray</hi> with an Army to divert the <hi>Spaniards</hi> from lending ſuccours to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers, and the Mareſhal <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> with another againſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces united. The firſt, paſſing the new ditch, the known and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent border betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Artois,</hi> maſtering certain Forts which defended it, layed Siege to <hi>Aire,</hi> a place moſt important, ſecured not only by Nature with much mooriſh grounds round about it, but ſtrengthened by Art with all ſorts of Fortifications within and without. <hi>Chaſtiglion,</hi> being come near to <hi>Sedan,</hi> met, on the ſixth of <hi>July, Lamboy</hi> together with the Princes malecontents. The Kings Army was ranged in excellent order upon a certain riſing ground, with great advantage, having the flanks covered with two little Woods. On the other ſide, that of the Princes, preſſed for want of room by reaſon of the ſituation, was rather confuſed than well and orderly placed; but, not being able to avoid the ſhock, certain of <hi>Chaſtillons</hi> Troops charged with ſo much reſolution, that ſome of the diviſions opening, and others retiring behind the Artillery, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſhewed the Royaliſts the way to a ſignal Victory. <hi>Soiſſons</hi>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:53750:255"/>
haſting to remedy this diſorder of his, armed at all pieces, with the viſier open, and with few that accompanied him, while he was mingled in the Fight being ſhot by a Souldier of the Company of <hi>Orleans</hi> with a Piſtol in the Eye, fell backwards from his Horſe on the ground, loſing at the inſtant his ſpeech and his life.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this ought to have confirmed to the Kings Army the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, it happens by a contrary accident, that the Cavalry took baſely the flight, without being purſued by any, either becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abhorred the ſpilling of ſo much of their fellow-ſubjects blood, or that ſome were glad to celebrate the Funerals of thoſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, under which they hoped to make War for private revenge upon the Cardinal. The iſſue was, that the Conquerours, ſtopped by themſelves in the courſe of their proſperity, nay rather turning their backs to fortune, became conquered; for the Imperial Troops and thoſe of the Princes over-running the Infantry, part were cut to pieces, and the reſt with all the Cannon and Baggage brought Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners into <hi>Sedan.</hi> Almoſt all the Officers ran the ſame fate, either of death or being taken, <hi>Chaſtilion,</hi> with a few others, ſaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with difficulty.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, with a notable example of the indulgence of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune towards the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu, Soiſſons</hi> being dead, who was the ſoul or rather the fury of the male-contents, the fruits of the Battel redounded not to the benefit of the victorious, but to thoſe that were defeated; for although <hi>Lamboi</hi> took in <hi>Doncheri,</hi> a little and a weak place, yet ſuch and ſo long was the reſiſtance, that it gave time to <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> to re-aſſemble in <hi>Rhetel</hi> the relicts of his men together, with new recruits, and for the King to arrive with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſo vigorous, that he not only recovered <hi>Doncheri</hi> at the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it, but threatning <hi>Sedan</hi> with a Siege, perſwaded <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illon</hi> to ſubmit and make his Peace. The place is, for its ſituation, for works, and defences, truly numbred amongſt the ſtrongeſt; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the Duke, conſidering the head of that undertaking to be dead, the others weak and in a fright, <hi>Spain</hi> turmoiled in ſo many parts, and <hi>Lamboy</hi> conſtrained to repair to the relief of <hi>Flanders,</hi> endeavoured to find his ſafety in the Kings favour, whereupon he ſtipulates an accord, obtaining neutrality for the Town, pardon for himſelf and all the party, except the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the Baron <hi>de Bech.</hi> Some of the male-contents returned to their Houſes, others would not at all truſt themſelves there, but diſperſed into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Provinces, or went into thoſe of <hi>Flanders,</hi> leaving to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal the merit or the fortune to have, though thus a loſer, ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rebellion, without intermitting in ſo many other parts the aſſiſting his Friends and offending his Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Siege of <hi>Air</hi> was in this interim carried on with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, in ſuch ſort, that, beſides infinite other factions, one and the ſame Half-moon was gained and loſt ſeveral times. But remaining at laſt in the power of the <hi>French</hi> gave them means to preſs the Town more powerfully, gain the Ditch, and after mines and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, to fix a lodgment upon a Baſtion. And now the place capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulated,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:53750:256"/>
the afflicting the County of <hi>Boulloin,</hi> and the Country there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts with great incurſions, having not at all availed the <hi>Spaniards</hi> for the removing <hi>Meilleray</hi> from the Siege.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ghenep</hi> was alſo rendred to <hi>Orange</hi> upon the ſame day that <hi>Aire</hi> was taken; but the <hi>French</hi> retained that Conqueſt but a very ſhort ſpace: For the Cardinal <hi>Infante</hi> joined with <hi>Lamboy</hi> ſtraitned it ſo cloſely, that <hi>Meilleray,</hi> wanting victuals, was hardly able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf, leaving the place unrepaired and provided. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entring into the Trenches and Poſts abandoned by the <hi>French;</hi> at the inſtance of the neighbouring Provinces, who, fearing the oppreſſions of the Enemy offered men and money, <hi>Aire</hi> was again beſieged. <hi>La Meilleray</hi> having not been able to thruſt in ſuccours from <hi>Terrouane,</hi> attacques <hi>la Baſſen,</hi> and the gaining of it proved an eaſie Conqueſt. <hi>Lens</hi> was likewiſe rendred to the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>de Brezé,</hi> and <hi>Baupaume</hi> defended it ſelf but nine days. <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> beſides was harraſſed, and <hi>Armentiers</hi> threatned, <hi>Fontenay,</hi> who had the body of an Army, being not able to hinder it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Orange</hi> on the other ſide gave jealouſie to the <hi>Sas</hi> of <hi>Ghent,</hi> and made ſhew as if he would paſs the Water-courſes thereabout. But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> eſteemed the recovery of <hi>Aire</hi> to be preferred before all they had loſt, and at laſt took it about the end of the year.</p>
               <p>But yet thoſe Provinces enjoyed not an entire contentment, for the Cardinal <hi>Infante</hi> dies to the extream grief of the Souldiery and of the People. He at his entry into thoſe Countries had gained a great applauſe; becauſe, laying aſide that loftineſs and gravity which ſeems contracted by the Princes in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> he had to the excellent prerogatives of piety and virtue added courteſie and affability, to the <hi>Flemmings</hi> moſt eſpecially acceptable. Nor failed they at <hi>Madrid</hi> to conceive jealouſie at it, the Governments far diſtant being always ſuſpected, eſpecially when adminiſtred by Princes of the blood Royal, and ſupported by Arms; knowing withall, that the <hi>French</hi> had oftentimes, by offering him to Wife the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> tempted him to make himſelf Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of thoſe Countries, aſſuring him of all their own Forces, and thoſe of <hi>Holland.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> in this conjuncture conceived cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hopes of a revolt in the Provinces, and the King comes with the Cardinal to the Frontiers; but they remained quiet, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather than contented with their new Governour, that was <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco de Melo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Germany</hi> a Diet was this year held at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> called by the Emperour, to the end to break another more jealous aſſembly, which the Princes of the Empire had a mind to have at <hi>Franckefort;</hi> but the Emperour found himſelf there in great danger: For <hi>Banier</hi> with a ſpeedy march being come from <hi>Erfordt</hi> near to <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube</hi> being frozen, began to cauſe his men to paſs over it, environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that City, with great hopes to take the Emperour Priſoner, or at leaſt beſiege him, and diſſipate the Diet. The defence being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed in much haſte and diſorder, the River by ſpecial favour from
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:53750:256"/>
Heaven was in a ſhort ſpace ſo thawed, that <hi>Banier</hi> being obliged to halt on the other ſide, thoſe which had paſſed were beaten and made Priſoners. <hi>Banier</hi> moves thence, and going to <hi>Cham</hi> had the good luck to take it. <hi>Piccolomini</hi> having beſet <hi>Schlang, Felt Marſhal,</hi> and given time to the Arch-Duke to come up with the Body, to receive the honour of the action, obliges him to render himſelf, together with four thouſand Horſe, all Priſoners. The <hi>Swedes,</hi> in this manner weakned, were forced to retreat, preſſed by the Arch-Duke; and, to ſay truth, <hi>Banier</hi> made his moſt excellent conduct appear, in that being inferiour in Forces, and retreating with the Enemy always in ſight, and in paſſing the River <hi>Egra,</hi> he received not the leaſt diſadvantage; but being come to <hi>Halverſtadt,</hi> ſurpriſed with a great ſickneſs he there dies. The <hi>Swedes</hi> were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where preſſed and purſued by the Imperialiſts, when the Count of <hi>Guebrian,</hi> who had ſucceeded <hi>Longueville</hi> in the command of the <hi>Weimarians,</hi> moving that Army, brought them a ſeaſonable relief. The ſtrong place of <hi>Wolfenbutel</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Luneburg</hi> was now ſtraitly beſieged by the Proteſtants, and <hi>Piccolomini,</hi> being come near to attempt the relief of it, was repulſed with a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable blow. Nevertheleſs ſtrong reſiſtance being ſtill made, the aggreſſors were forced to retire. On the other ſide, <hi>Dorſten</hi> in <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> fell into the hands of <hi>Hatzfeldt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe ſucceſſes ſerved rather to protract the War, than to end it; though it appeared, that the Negotiations for the Peace were ſomething more than formerly facilitated; for that the Emperour at laſt conſented, to the ſatisfaction of the confederate Crowns, the ſafe conducts for the Princes of the Empire, and, at the interpoſition of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> was in <hi>Hamburg,</hi> by <hi>Lutzau, d' Ava,</hi> and <hi>Salvins,</hi> Miniſters of the Emperour, <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Swedes,</hi> a Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, which was called, of the <hi>Preliminaries,</hi> by which the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which formerly was to have been held in <hi>Colen,</hi> being tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported to <hi>Munſter</hi> and <hi>Oſnaburg,</hi> Cities which were left Neutral and without Garriſon, it was agreed that in the former ſhould be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted all that which belonged to the <hi>Auſtrians, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and in the latter the intereſt of <hi>Swede</hi> and its Confederates with the Emperour and his Adherents. But when things were thought in a readineſs to give a beginning to the managements of the Peace, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difficulties aroſe; and the Emperour thought to clear them by publiſhing in <hi>Ratisbone</hi> an Amneſty, or general Oblivion, or Pardon of things paſt, but he rather increaſed them; for by excluding the cauſe of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> by remitting it to a particular Treaty, many decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves not ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe univerſal agitations, the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> reſtored to quiet, felt only ſome little diſturbance for private conteſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Borderers in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> occaſioned by the exceeding ill will of <hi>Ali Bei</hi> and <hi>Durat</hi> his Son, who bore the ſway in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rana.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the beginning brought ſome trouble, the <hi>Turk</hi> entring with armed men into the Territory of <hi>Zara</hi> to the ruine of the Campa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, yet it was quickly quieted, the Port ſending upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:53750:257"/>
of <hi>Girotamo Triviſano, Bailo,</hi> a <hi>Chiaux</hi> into thoſe parts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh the Peace. It happened, that he coming near the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, thoſe of <hi>Verpoglie,</hi> Subjects to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to repair ſome da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages they had ſuffered, committed in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Country far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er miſchief. The Miniſters thereupon offended, would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged it upon the Territory of <hi>Sebenico</hi> with Arms; but <hi>Giovanni Baptiſta Grimani,</hi> General of the Province, with his dexterity, whilſt <hi>Luigi Malipiero,</hi> that commanded the Cavalry, was ready to ſuccour the places moſt threatned, perſwaded them to a compoſure, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the friendſhip by the reſtoring of Commerce, and the <hi>Turks</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhing a certain new Fortification raiſed at <hi>Verveco.</hi> The Port heard willingly the news of quiet; for having ſetled a Peace with the <hi>Perſian</hi> upon the former conditions, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Arms were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the gaining of <hi>Aſach,</hi> a moſt ſtrong place, upon the <hi>Palus Moeotis,</hi> kept by thoſe <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who under the protection of <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> committed in the Black Sea moſt cruel miſchiefs, even within the ſight of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> therefore freed alſo from that care, ſtood immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able betwixt the inſtances, which, with offers of great advantages, both the Crowns preſſed them with, each to draw them to their own party. The <hi>French</hi> repreſented that plant fading, which not long ſince overſhadowed <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> and invited them to reap together with the other <hi>Italian</hi> Princes the rich ſpoils; the King willingly yielding to them the hopes and the fruits of ſo noble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. On the other ſide was ſhewed by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters the dangers of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> and offered to conſideration, whether, that ſerving as a Barricado and Intrenchment to hinder the Inundations of the <hi>French</hi> into the bowels of <hi>Italy,</hi> it ought not to be ſupported and defended by united Forces. The Republick, on whom the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of quiet was more incumbent than that which might ſpur on the opportunity of Conqueſts, anſwered to the one and to the other with equal expreſſions of reſpect and confidence. To ſay truth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> paſſed with great confuſion; for that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year, Prince <hi>Thomaſo</hi> having recanted his Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> the King of <hi>Spain</hi> at his inſtance had removed <hi>Leganes,</hi> and ſubſtituted in the Government the Count <hi>de Sirvela,</hi> the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the Power becoming thereby much weakned, both becauſe of his weaker capacity, and that the Power of the Monarchy, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted into ſo many parts, was not able to aſſiſt <hi>Italy</hi> with a vigour equal to the neceſſity.</p>
               <p>On this account <hi>Turenne,</hi> though with but indifferent Forces, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily regains <hi>Moncalvo,</hi> and out of complacency to <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who counted himſelf greatly injured by Prince <hi>Thomaſo</hi> for the deluſion of the Treaties, <hi>Inurea</hi> was beſieged at the time that the Prince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was at <hi>Milan</hi> to make ſome agreements with the Governour, and to demand aſſiſtance. The defence nevertheleſs was bravely main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>Silvio di Savoy,</hi> natural Brother to the Prince, and by <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellino Maria Viſconti, Maeſtro di Campo,</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> who in the night by ſtealth got themſelves into it. <hi>Hartourt</hi> howſoever he approved not
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:53750:257"/>
the undertaking, ſeeing <hi>Turenne</hi> ingaged, came to the Camp, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by a general aſſault to have put an end to it; but that being withſtood and repulſed with loſs to the Aggreſſors, he ſaw a while after, through the negligence of his Sentinels, the Baron <hi>di Prel</hi> with four hundred Souldiers to enter into it. For all this he retires not; but Prince <hi>Thomaſo,</hi> who loſing the place, remained without a place of retreat at the diſcretion of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſollicited the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Milan,</hi> that he would attacque the <hi>French</hi> Trenches. <hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vela</hi> on the other ſide refuſing to hazard all at one ſole blow, aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rather for a diverſion to attacque <hi>Chivas,</hi> where a ſurpriſe by Scalade not ſucceeding, the Siege was laid. To relieve it the <hi>French</hi> retired from <hi>Inurea,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> having gained their deſign ſtayed no longer before <hi>Chivas. Harcourt</hi> propoſing to himſelf more important deſigns, to force the Prince Cardinal, to open to himſelf the communication with the Sea, and to enlarge his Quarters, poſſeſſes without much ado <hi>Ceva, Mondovi,</hi> and other places thereabout; lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Siege at laſt to <hi>Cuneo,</hi> a place, which for the fortifications and the ſituation upon the folds of a Mountain, carried the boaſt never to have been taken by force. But after many Factions and hard En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters the Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Cataneo,</hi> that commanded in it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 12. of <hi>September</hi> renders it, ſucceſleſs having proved the utmoſt endeavours of Prince <hi>Thomaſo</hi> and of <hi>Servela</hi> to ſend in ſuccours or attempt diverſions. The loſs of <hi>Cuneo</hi> troubled the Princes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and no leſs the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> but theſe were touched at the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Monaco</hi> more than with ought elſe.</p>
               <p>That Town ſtands upon an eminence, which thruſts forth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory into the Sea, and covers a Shore rather than a Port, where the River of <hi>Genona</hi> terminates upon the Confines of the County of <hi>Nizza.</hi> It gives name to a little Principality, formerly for a long time poſſeſſed by the Family of <hi>Grimaldi.</hi> Till one thouſand ſix hundred and five the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> allured by the convenience of the ſituation, brought into it a ſtrong Garriſon, by the conſent, for his private advantages, of the Prince <hi>di Val di Taro,</hi> Uncle and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Honorato,</hi> Prince of <hi>Monaco,</hi> then a Minor. There reſided a Governour for the Crown, who exerciſed very often, beſides his Command, over-much licence; beſides that, the pay for the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being delayed to be ſent from <hi>Milan</hi> by reaſon of the preſent occupations, the Prince was forced, to exempt himſelf from the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Souldiers, to diſburſe it out of his own money. His houſe alſo was the common Inn for all thoſe that paſſed out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo that he found himſelf exhauſted and oppreſſed on all ſides, drawing very little from certain Lands in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and nothing at all from the Penſions aſſigned him in recompence of the Garriſon received. Willing therefore to ſhake off the yoke, he ſets on foot in great ſecrecy practices with the <hi>French,</hi> without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been able for ſeveral years to compaſs his intention, the <hi>French</hi> ſometimes being not in readineſs, and at others the Garriſon ſtrong, and the Governour vigilant. At laſt <hi>Monſignor Grimaldi</hi> paſſing that way, ſent by the Pope to the Nuntiature of <hi>France,</hi> it was taken for
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:53750:258"/>
granted, that the Prince, as to a Kinſman, opened his thoughts to him, and that he managed the buſineſs with <hi>Richelieu.</hi>

               <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> having conceived no ſlight jealouſie of it, gives notice of it to <hi>Sirvela;</hi> but he not making any matter of it, only warns the Governour to be upon his Guard, and he anſwers with great boaſting, offering, when he ſhould be commanded, to bring the Prince Priſoner to <hi>Milan.</hi> A while after, to ſupply the neceſſity of the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy,</hi> part of the Garriſon of <hi>Monaco</hi> was ſent to his relief; and more to weaken the reſt, the Prince took occaſion of the refuſal of <hi>Roccabruna,</hi> a place of his, to diſburſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain money, which was juſt to ſerve for the payment of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and perſwaded the Governour to ſend ſixty more to quarter there for a chaſtiſement. Invited by this occaſion, he cauſes to be brought to him by night certain of his Subjects, who for ſeveral of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences he kept impriſoned; and while the Governour and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers ſlept more ſoundly from the Jolity and the Wine of a Supper, in which the Prince had nobly entertained them, communicates to them the deſire and intention to rid himſelf of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> now but few in number, and at preſent ſleeping in great ſecurity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they would be aſſiſting to deliver him from that oppreſſion under which for ſo many years he had innocently groaned. All, for the liberty which he promiſed them, conſenting to the common ſafety, ſhaking off their Fetters, armed themſelves, and the Prince with thoſe of the Court, putting himſelf at the head of one Troop, and his Son at that of the other, they ſet forward to aſſault in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts the Garriſon, who expecting nothing elſe, were diſarmed without defence, and after the death of ſome, the reſt made Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The Prince advertiſes preſently to the Count <hi>d'Ales,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Provenza,</hi> who having in a readineſs a relief of Proviſions and Souldiers, ſent it without delay by Sea. The Prince then ſends back to <hi>Sirvela</hi> the Souldiers that were Priſoners and the Order of the Fleece, becauſe he had ſecretly conſented to receive from King <hi>Lodowick</hi> that of the Holy Ghoſt, to keep in <hi>Monaco</hi> a Garriſon of <hi>French,</hi> and in recompence of that which he ſhould loſe in <hi>Naples</hi> and elſewhere, to enjoy in Fief the Dutchy of <hi>Valence</hi> in <hi>Dauphiné</hi> with advantages and penſions for himſelf and his Son.</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICK OF VENICE. THE TWELFTH BOOK.</head>
            <p>AS an Appendix to ſo many others which tore Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in pieces, ſerved the War newly ſtarted up in <hi>Italy,</hi> if not great for the occaſions, for the effects and for the exploits, famous at leaſt for the contention of minds, curious for the variety of intereſts, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant for the quality of the managements. The original was aſcribed to certain diſguſts of the <hi>Barbarins,</hi> Nephews of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> againſt <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Prince of <hi>Parma;</hi> and they came to be fomented from grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings already conceived by ſeveral Potentates againſt the Pope and his Houſe; for the Pontificate being governed in theſe laſt times by his Nephews with an abſolute command (<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> being under the burden of his years weakned in his vigour and authority,) it ſeemed, that with various injuries to the Princes, they abuſed their power and fortune with an exceſs of licenſe. He that had moſt of the Popes affection and favour, was the Cardinal <hi>Franciſco,</hi> deep in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, often irreſolute, always a friend to his own Counſels, eaſie to ſuſpect, and tenacious in what he affected. On the other ſide, the Duke <hi>Edward</hi> was of high and active ſpirits, ſenſible of every diſpleaſure, prone to reſentments, otherwiſe dignified with the Arts Military and Civil Sciences to ſuch a degree, that nothing wanted to rank him amongſt the moſt commendable and greateſt Princes, but that Fortune had either given him an Empire and power equal to his mind, or Prudence equalled his mind to his fortune and power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="504" facs="tcp:53750:259"/>In the forementioned War, undertaken by the Duke againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> with boldneſs more than needed, ſome ſeeds of diſcontent had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been ſcattered betwixt him and the <hi>Barbarins;</hi> either becauſe it ſeemed to the Duke, that the Pope had with coldneſs interpoſed to divert the dangers or rather imminent ruine of his Countries; or that he had diſcovered from the propoſitions, which the Nephews had cauſed to be brought to him in that conjuncture, to ſell and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate certain of his Lands for their advantage, that the aim of that Family tended more to their private conveniency than to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of State. <hi>Edward</hi> afterwards going to <hi>Rome</hi> in the year one thouſand ſix hundred thirty nine, diſguſts brake forth more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for not being treated with thoſe Ceremonies, which he affirmed were firſt promiſed him, nor the Prince <hi>Franciſco Maria</hi> his Brother promoted to the Cardinalat, in the purſuit whereof, with great hopes to effect it, the Duke notwithſtanding affirmed to have been engaged by the <hi>Barbarins,</hi> he only obtained of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> power to leſſen the Revenue of the <hi>Monti,</hi> with a half <hi>per Cent;</hi> upon the advance whereof, grounding a new increaſe of the Capital, all he got was to go thence with a not contemptible ſum of money. That is called at <hi>Rome</hi> mony <hi>de Monti,</hi> which in <hi>Venice</hi> is called <hi>di Zecca,</hi> depoſited by private perſons, on the condition of an annual Rent, which by the <hi>Farneſe</hi> had been aſſigned upon the Revenues of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> a Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom they held in Fief of the Church, and which, by the vicinity to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſerving them for convenience and honours, gave notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding no jealouſie to the Popes, it having no places of ſtrength in it. The <hi>Barbarins</hi> ſecretly tempted, as in recompenſe of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour obtained, the mind of <hi>Edward,</hi> to <hi>cede</hi> to them certain places of that State, contiguous to their Lands; but the motion being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, favours were changed into unkindneſs: Whereupon, though the Pope did not recall the grant, it was yet croſſed by the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, and with ſundry delays and difficulties prolonged and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed.</p>
            <p>The Duke, hereat irritated, haſtens his departure from <hi>Rome,</hi> and vented his diſcontents, publiſhing them to the Courts by not viſiting the <hi>Barbarins</hi> nor the Pope, by inveighing againſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Franciſco</hi> and his Government ſo highly, that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> was moved at it even to fears; but they were quickly converted into wrath, and ſharp reſentments. For the Duke, enjoying by conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Popes, the draught of Corn out of his Country, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> on a ſudden forbids it, and in that conſiſting the beſt Revenues of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro,</hi> the exportation failing, the <hi>Siri,</hi> Merchants, to whom the Duke had farmed it for ninety 7000 Crowns <hi>per an.</hi> renounce the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereupon, that ſum being not able to be raiſed, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to pay the Montiſts, they had recourſe to the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and obtained, that the Duke ſhould be juridically cited. He imputes all to the <hi>Barbarins,</hi> as if they deſigned to deſpoil him of that Country, and ſeeing the perſon of the Judge not ſeparate from that of his Enemies, he believed he ſhould be overborn; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not regarding the way of Judicature, he reſolves to fortifie
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:53750:259"/>
himſelf againſt force not only with right but Arms alſo, ſending <hi>Delfino Angelieri,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Monferrat,</hi> Governour, with a Garriſon to <hi>Caſtro,</hi> and cauſing half-moons and Redouts to be caſt up about the place. This being judged by the <hi>Barberins</hi> a crime, as if he would reſiſt his Soveraign, a Monitory was publiſhed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor of the Chamber, in which limiting to the Duke thirty days, to demoliſh the Fortifications of <hi>Castro</hi> and disband the Garriſon; it otherwiſe declared him to have incurred Rebellion and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: The Thunder whereof was now foreſeen to be near at hand; for the <hi>Barberins</hi> raiſing Souldiers in all haſte, ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and five hundred Horſe, with ſome Cannon joined at <hi>Viterbo,</hi> under the Prefect, as Generaliſſimo, and the Marqueſs <hi>Lui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi Mathei</hi> Maſter <hi>de Camp</hi> General, with other Chiefs, and great proviſions. This ſudden arming awakened attention in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and various diſcourſes amongſt the people; for in the Pope, who, while he was yet not ſo old, had with ſo much care cultivated Peace, they were obliged to believe great thoughts and ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, if in the extremity of his years he ſhould reſolve to diſturb it, and ſo much the more in a Conjuncture, that Chriſtendom mangled and languiſhing required from his fatherly care quiet and reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Italy,</hi> expoſed as a prey to Strangers, gaſped after remedy and ſafety from the concord of its Princes. All was imputed to the Nephews, and their intentions were accuſed, as either bent to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themſelves of the Duke, by depriving him of his Eſtate near them; or extended, as was rather believed, to more vaſt objects.</p>
            <p>The Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> ſhewed himſelf above all jealous at it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew, that to the contrivances of the <hi>French</hi> upon that Kingdom the <hi>Barberins</hi> had lent their ear, and perhaps their help in concert with ſome of the Barons, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> alſo, the Grand Duke, was no leſs diſpleaſed to ſee the Pope armed upon his Confines, and in deſign of making new Conqueſts, having, beſides his own and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſiderations not to ſuffer him to increaſe in power, found the will of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> originary of his Country, ſo averſe from giving him ſatisfaction, as, in whatſoever buſineſs he had with them, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing but prejudices or diſguſts. Nor did differing thoughts reſide in the minds of others; every one ſhewing himſelf at a ſtand at this novelty, and ſome covering with the appearing jealouſie of War the hope of advantages, if any diſturbance ſhould be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The Viceroy, above all afflicting himſelf, becauſe this new ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion on the Confines kept him from ſending into <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Milan</hi> the ſuccours demanded and neceſſary, became more earneſt in his Mediation, requiring from the Pope, that the proceeding againſt <hi>Edward</hi> might be only in an equal and judicial way.</p>
            <p>The Grand Duke alſo interpoſes his offices to the ſame effect; and believing, that <hi>Parma</hi> alſo ſtood in need to have the heat of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits moderated, diſpatches the Marqueſs <hi>Guicciardini</hi> to perſwade the Duke to mitigate his paſſion, and give way to a Treaty; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to it, in a manner by force had denied the paſſage of Souldiers, which <hi>Edward</hi> was ſending to <hi>Caſtro,</hi> and prohibited ſome
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:53750:260"/>
Proviſions, which for the better providing of the place, were to be drawn out of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> The Pope, with oppoſite and conciſe replies, without other expreſſions, but a reſolution to maintain inviolated the Decorum of humbling his Vaſſal, and make himſelf be obeyed, gave no place for a Treaty.</p>
            <p>At this time the Republick had no other Miniſter at <hi>Rome</hi> but <hi>Girolamo Bon,</hi> a Secretary; the Ambaſſador Extraordinary, the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ceaſing which induced to ſend him, having been recalled, and for an ordinary no care was taken to ſend one, until the <hi>Elogium</hi> ſhould come to be reſtored. The Nuntio was ſeldom admitted into the Colledge to Audience, and he comprehending of what importance the Declaration of the Senate in the preſent affairs would be, not being able to ſuppoſe it favourable to the <hi>Barberins,</hi> endeavoured to keep their minds either diverted or in a ſlumber; ſometimes with artifice, conſidering the evils imminent upon <hi>Italy</hi> from fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Armies; and at others ſcoffing with deriſion at the affair of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> as a thing of a ſlight importance. At laſt when proviſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and Forces aſſembled, and that towards the <hi>Bologneſe,</hi> he aſſured that all was in order to Peace, and to ſuppreſs a certain ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious attempt of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> though the Pope ſhould poſſibly be obliged to ſend ſome few Souldiers to <hi>Melara</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Po,</hi> and on the Borders of the Republick. But the Count <hi>Ferdinando Scotti,</hi> who, though under pay of the Republick, ſerved in this occaſion the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> whoſe Vaſſal by birth he was, with oppoſite offices repreſented in the preſent affairs the cauſes of the hatreds and the intentions of the <hi>Barberins</hi> much differing. He alledged the Right of the Duke, aggravated the violence which was done him, and together with the ill example, the prejudices which would redound from it to all the Princes. He demanded of the Senate counſel, the better to govern himſelf in the buſineſs, and aſſiſtance to reſiſt the force. He communicates the intention of the Duke, if <hi>Caſtro</hi> were aſſaulted, to go himſelf to its relief, whilſt that place being maintained, the <hi>Barberins</hi> being humbled would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt incline to Peace; but if he ſhould yield, they by the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of it being rendred more lofty, the heat of the War might be tranſported into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and draw, to take part, the Arms of the Crowns, greedy above meaſure to intereſt the <hi>Italians</hi> in their differences. He expreſſed the intentions of the Duke as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to a juſt accord, as reſolved, notwithſtanding any hazard or ingagement, to maintain his affairs and his right.</p>
            <p>The Senate, in ſo weighty an emergency, could not but ſtand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed concerning the manner how to govern it ſelf, being equally diſpleaſed at the cauſes of new ſtirs in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the effects of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the <hi>Barberins.</hi> Whereupon opinions differing, the Senate being aſſembled, <hi>Giovanni Piſari,</hi> Cavalier and Procurator, endeavors to perſwade, that the Duke might be received into the protection of the Republick; haranguing to this purpoſe: <hi>From the prudent and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Cuſtoms of our Anceſtors, to ſuccour the weak, and aſſiſt the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, practiſed ſo many times by our ſelves with glory and advantage,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:53750:260"/>
the Duke of</hi> Parma <hi>hath taken a rational confidence to have recourſe to the Patronage of our Republick. The cauſe may ſeem remote to ſome, and perhaps the intereſt not great; but the</hi> Barbarins <hi>paſſing from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conteſts to a War, from Acts judiciary to Arms, the example is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of conſequence to all, and the danger of it near at hand. This Senate hath voluntarily eſpouſed the glory of being the Guardian of the Liberty of</hi> Italy, <hi>and the Protector of Princes oppreſſed. But in what cauſe can it imploy it ſelf more juſtly than in that, in which if on the one ſide paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion contends with intereſt, on the other right appears deſtitute of power? That a Pope almoſt fourſcore years of age, arms, is a great conſideration. But that his Nephews manage the Treaſuries, and the Armies reſolve upon Invaſions, and trample upon Princes, is very much done. Certainly the blow tends not only where it aims; but if all be threatned, 'tis reaſon that all ſhould intereſt themſelves in reſiſting. Ambition hath its Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but limits not the Circumference. It covets and ſwallows all, and dilates it ſelf there where it ſeems to ſeek a boundary.</hi> Caſtro <hi>is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at preſent. But why ſo great preparations for a weak place, ill provided, without other reputation, but that which the ſame of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affairs gives it? That place taken, they will go forward;</hi> Parma <hi>and</hi> Piacenza <hi>ſhall not go free, and Duke</hi> Edward <hi>vanquiſhed, what ſeems not eaſie to the faſt and avarice of the</hi> Barberins? <hi>Who then will be ſo bold to call a great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking a ſmall Buſineſs? A flame which will be increaſed by it ſelf with the fuel of ſo many deſigns and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts? The</hi> Spaniards, <hi>always cautious, fear for the Kingdom of</hi> Naples. <hi>The Grand Duke, a moſt prudent Prince, apprehends for</hi> Tuſcany. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers obſerve with terrour the example; for if he that offends will alſo revenge himſelf, who is not offended by the</hi> Barberins? <hi>The Princes have ſeveral times born without reſentment their contempts; if they permit at preſent alſo a profitable violence, to what height will their attempts grow? Who knows but that the Nephews of</hi> Urban, <hi>knowing they have offended many, deſign not to fortifie themſelves before-hand againſt all; or that in the decaying age of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle, perceiving their Dominion to be ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering, deſign not to maintain with Arms, if not in their own perſons, an hereditary Command, at leaſt a continual Pontificat in thoſe depending on them in their Maxims and in their Intereſts. I invite not the Senate to reſentments, nor call to remembrance the injuries, the diſguſts, and the ſpightfulneſs, I would ſay, paſt, if the memory of their attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Dignity and the Piety of our worthy Anceſtors were not yet, even by the defacing of the Marble, conſpicuous at preſent. I rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort with a generous ſetting at naught of our own concerns to contribute, to the good of Chriſtendom, that much which may be pretended. But that we ſhould permit the oppreſſion of the Duke of</hi> Parma, <hi>and ſuffer a fire, which will not only burn</hi> Italy, <hi>but tranſport its flames into all the Catholick Provinces, will ſtir up the Proteſtants, and inflame the</hi> Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, <hi>is not my advice; and if the</hi> Barberins, <hi>in a ſhort and caſual command, neglect the conſequences of ſo great evils, they ought not to be omitted by the Princes, to whom with the perpetuity of Dominion is recommended by God the ſafety of the people, and the care of the world. This cannot be better effected, than by oppoſing the beginnings, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi>
               <pb n="508" facs="tcp:53750:261"/>
Caſtro, <hi>and aſſiſting the Duke of</hi> Parma, <hi>that he may be able to ſuccour and defend it; if otherwiſe it be loſt, and that with this blow of Sword and Fire there be added a new plague to the ſo many languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of</hi> Italy, <hi>and Arms come to be imployed, the War will be ſo long, and accidents will happen ſo unforeſeen, that the moſt averſe will be conſtrained to take part in it. If by ſhewing a force only we may gain Peace, why ſhall we let Hoſtility run on with ſo much ſlaughter and ſuch ſpreading calamities, that our Poſterity perhaps will have cauſe for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages to deplore the memory and Authors of them. I firmly believe, that it is ſufficient to declare our ſelves, and give them to underſtand at</hi> Rome, <hi>that theſe Novelties, Violences, and Invaſions are not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. The</hi> Barberins <hi>will hearken to Conditions, when they ſee their Arms not likely to have ſucceſs; and with the</hi> Equilibrium <hi>of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to the honour of whom ſhall have been the Author of it, a Peace will be concluded, confirming thereby the greateſt benefit, which our Republick can poſſibly do to</hi> Italy, <hi>to Chriſtendom, and to the Church it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although ſome inclined to this courſe, nevertheleſs it ſeemed to the major part not yet ſeaſonable to reſolve. Whereupon <hi>Vincenzo Guſſoni,</hi> Cavalier, ſpake; <hi>War being the ultimate Decree of the power and of the right and reaſon of Princes, it is fit to enter into it with a ſlow pace, and if the</hi> Barberins <hi>do therein precipitate themſelves, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us to oppoſe diſcretion to impatience, and with prudence to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle paſſions. I confeſs, that to the Popes Nephews moderation would be of equal commendation and duty; but withal the Duke of</hi> Parma <hi>hath no need of Spurs; a fiery Prince, who provoked by himſelf runs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments. The wiſdom therefore of the Senate, for the aſſwaging of Spirits and humours, ought to the one, to uſe effectual remonſtrances, and to the other, moderation of counſels. It is no time at preſent to add an increaſe of evils to this afflicted Country. It languiſhes but too much by the War, which, though it rage in the extreme parts, yet attracts the blood, the money, the minds, and apprehenſions of all. But if in that part which remains untouched by the fire, we ſhall cut the veins and the ſinews, what will follow of it elſe but an extreme languiſhment, and in concluſion an unhappy falling under the deſigns of Strangers and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the</hi> Barbarians? Italy <hi>cannot make War with the alone Forces of the</hi> Italians. <hi>Both the Crowns will greedily come in, and confounding ours with their own intereſts, we ſhall relegate the hopes of Peace to thoſe Aſſemblies, where not to end them, the Treaties cannot yet find a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The invitations, the promiſes of two moſt powerful Kings, the Conjuncture of the Times, the hopes of great advantages, have not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been able to remove us out of our Neutrality; therefore modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting counſels with juſtice and prudence, we have let the World know, that there is no cauſe here, that without cauſe can perſwade us to a War. And ſhall we now by another way, and that by compulſion, enter into the Labyrinth of the common diſcords, and ſhall we therein be guided by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualties, accidents, and the will of others? Who knows not, but when the</hi> Barberins <hi>ſhall believe themſelves not able to compaſs their deſigns, they will ſhelter themſelves under the countenance of a greater Power, and
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:53750:261"/>
being to ſtrives invited by both the Crowns, it will be at their choice to declare for that which ſhall prove moſt advantagious, or appear moſt ſucceſsful? So the weaker joyning it ſelf to the one, the other in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will neceſſarily intrude it ſelf, or be called in. Shall we then ſee the Mediators of the common Peace of Chriſtendom fall foul among themſelves, with need of Interpoſers, or rather of aſſiſtance? Shall the Pope appear environed with armed men? And will the Senate of</hi> Venice <hi>be willing to contradict themſelves in that boaſt, to have always imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Sword againſt the Enemies of the Church? My opinion is, that following the moſt peaceable Counſels, ſuch emergencies cannot ſpring up, as may diſpute peace with violence; but I rather foreſee the caſe very eaſie: For if the Nephews of the Pope ſhall be willing to alter and diſturb the affairs of</hi> Italy, <hi>and with the Arms of the Princes vent their private revenges, I know well, that it will be of neceſſity to oppoſe them, and not to ſuffer the injuſtice and the example. But if the end, which is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, may be obtained by peaceable means; if the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>if the Grand Duke, if all elſe, according to their intereſt or vicinity, uſe only the way of mediation, why ſhall the Senate be the firſt to carry a brand to the fire, and not rather with reaſons, intreaties, and offices, do their endeavour to ſettle a Peace, or at leaſt in all events to juſtifie a War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was reſolved with full Votes for this Opinion, and by the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio's, being called into the Colledge, and in <hi>Rome</hi> by the mouth of the Secretary, the Pope was effectually intreated to yield to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and common ſatisfaction of the Princes, who with unanimous deſires interpoſed themſelves for the Peace, by giving time and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients for a Treaty. To the Duke, forbearing in their anſwers any mention of aſſiſtance, they gave counſel of moderation, inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the reſpect with ſome ſort of humiliation, which might be of avail to pacifie the Pope, and bring him honourably off the ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But whilſt Courriers flew to and fro with offices of Peace, the <hi>Barberins,</hi> (not to let themſelves be overcome by the common conſent of the Princes) haſted their march all they could, with a firm opinion, that having poſſeſſed, as it was not difficult, <hi>Caſtro,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fervour of the Mediators minds would be ſlackned, or the Treaty be protracted with ſuch intricacies, that the Dukes heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abated, and the endeavours of the Mediators, by many acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that might happen, growing faint, the Glory of the Counſels, and the Merit of the Enterpriſe would fall out to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>A great part of this reſolution and of others which were taken upon it, was imputed to the Nuntio <hi>Vitelli,</hi> who, perſwaded by falſe ſuppoſitions, and the diſcourſes of the Vulgar, that the <hi>Venetians;</hi> beſides the making of a ſhew, and doing good offices, were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>There is a rocky Mountain, which for ſeveral miles environs the Eccleſiaſtical State on that ſide, interrupted by certain ways, cut out by hand with great labour. Where it deſcends towards the Sea, it terminates in a Plain, and forms as it were a Cliff of a ſoft moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Stone, upon which <hi>Caſtro</hi> ſtands. There is but one way which ſerves to aſcend to it, which the Duke had cauſed to be fortified with ſome little Forts. The Eccleſiaſtical Army appearing, they quickly yielded; whereupon <hi>Matthei</hi> planting Cannon againſt the Town, and flinging certain Bomboes into it, perſwades the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants through fear to ſollicite the Governour to deliver it, without expecting the ſuccours, which by permiſſion of the Grand Duke, the Count <hi>Palmia</hi> was bringing through <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> Upon conditions of Life, Liberty, and enjoyment of Goods to the Souldiers and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, the Garriſon, two hundred and fifty in number, marched out the ſeventh day of the Siege. <hi>Angelieri,</hi> though he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to clear himſelf, accuſing the baſeneſs of the people and the the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, who being retired into the Town, preferring ſafety before fidelity and honour, had perſwaded him by force to render, the Duke cauſed him to be arreſted, grievouſly vexed at the news of the Surrender, which came to him, at the inſtant, that he in perſon was intended to go towards thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Barberins</hi> triumphed as much at ſo ſpeedy a Conqueſt, and that ſort of people abounding in <hi>Rome,</hi> which have no other reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue but flattery, exalted with many diſcourſes and applauſes the order, the conduct, the whole enterpriſe, and calling to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that by that way the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi> had formerly led his Army to the Siege and Sack of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pontificate of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> and the direction of his Nephews was celebrated with great Encomiums; for that, by the re-union of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbino,</hi> that Flank being ſecured, the taking of <hi>Caſtro</hi> did invincibly cover the other ſide of the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical State. The <hi>Barberins</hi> alſo enjoyed equally publick glory and private advantages, having ſecured their Eſtate and Towns from the fury and invaſions of the Duke, and foreſeeing, that if ever he ſhould recover that State, his neighbourhood would be ſo much the more troubleſom to them, as the injuries were more provoking, they reſolved never to render that they had taken, but to reſiſt with Art and with Arms whoſoever ſhould interpoſe offices, or imploy force, taking it for granted, that neither the Duke would have the vigour to act of himſelf, not would others in the preſent Conjunctures, by giving him aſſiſtance, make themſelves Enemies to the Pope. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> to keep himſelf from thoſe prejudices, which in the way of Judicature, the Acts that had paſt might bring upon him, had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be preſented to the Auditor <hi>della Camera,</hi> a proteſt, in which
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:53750:262"/>
he declared the <hi>Barberins</hi> for his Enemies, but gave them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that he had no other Judge left him but force, nor did hope for favour but from his friends. He renews therefore conſiderations and inſtances with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and to ſet a gloſs upon them, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers all juſt humiliation to the Pope, that ſo he might know how to encounter his good Graces. Shewing alſo his doubt of being attac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued in his Dominions of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza,</hi> he beſought of the Senate a thouſand Foot and a hundred thouſand Crowns to garriſon and provide the Towns. The Republick perſiſting as yet in the way of Treaty, had a mind to renew their offices at <hi>Rome,</hi> to the end that thoſe judiciary Acts, being intermitted and ſuſpended, which put one ſide into ingagements, and the other into diſſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, the Dukes humiliations might be admitted, and a way made for Treaty, for which they were not averſe to diſpatch an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Ambaſſadour to the Pope.</p>
            <p>Hereupon was variety of opinions amongſt the <hi>Barberins;</hi> for ſome approved to ingage the Republick in the mediation, ſo to keep it off from declaring and giving aſſiſtance to the Duke; others aiming to keep off a Treaty with deluſions, conſidered, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick was that Prince that was leaſt capable to be deceived, moſt prone to reſentments, and the moſt powerful amongſt thoſe of <hi>Italy;</hi> ſo that it would be better to exclude them out of the Mediation; becauſe overlooking the occaſion of ingaging and intereſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the offices of aſſiſtance to the Duke, they believed it would rather continue watching upon the general occurrences of <hi>Europe,</hi> and on the ſucceſſes of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Monſerrat,</hi> than apply it ſelf to a particular intereſt of ſmall importance to <hi>Italy,</hi> and of no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to it ſelf. The Pope therefore ſeemed to hear with trouble the offices brought to him by order of the Senate; and rather ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king light of them, not without ſcorn, refuſes to ſtop the courſe of Law, and admit Mediators betwixt Soveraign and Vaſſal, of whom he intended to require humiliations, perſiſting to have him come in perſon to render him the reſpect was due to him. Nor had the <hi>Barberins</hi> greater apprehenſions of the other Princes, obſerving, that the Miniſters of <hi>Spain,</hi> though fluctuant amidſt moſt weighty jealouſies, proceeded nevertheleſs with great moderation, and the Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> notwithſtanding the protection, which his King ſhewed to have Prince <hi>Edward</hi> in, proceeded with coolneſs and reſerve, both the Crowns agreeing in the maxims and the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, rather to gain than make themſelves Enemies with the Pope, and his Houſe.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Grand Duke and the other <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, the Pope being armed, ſeemed rather in ſuſpicion to receive diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, than capable to give it, and ſo much the more, by how much the <hi>Barberins</hi> amuſed them in Treaty with greater gentleneſs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing in particular of ſeveral expedients with the Marqueſs <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecucoli,</hi> ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Modena;</hi> and thoſe, conſiſted in depoſiting <hi>Caſtro</hi> in hand of the Cardinal <hi>d' Eſte,</hi> Brother of the Duke of the ſame name, for ſo long till that the purchaſe of <hi>Pontre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moli</hi>
               <pb n="512" facs="tcp:53750:263"/>
being concluded by the <hi>Barberins,</hi> which, for want of money, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were treating to ſell, this might be conſigned to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and that remain to the Church; or that the <hi>Camera,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the obligation to pay the <hi>Montiſis,</hi> ſhould recompenſe the <hi>Farneſi,</hi> with other Fiefs in lieu of <hi>Caſtro.</hi> It was alſo propoſed, that, to ſecure preſent ſuſpicions, an Eccleſiaſtical Garriſon ſhould remain in that place for ſome years, and then, jealouſies being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, every thing to return freely to their firſt owners. Yet the Cardinal <hi>Barbarin</hi> not long after declares himſelf, that any expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent would hardly be admitted, which required the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro</hi> and <hi>Montalto;</hi> but as to the more open Country ſeems to think, that to render that, the Pope would not be found much againſt it. There was great difficulty in all, the parties agreeing in one point only, to make uſe of equal art to gain the advantage of time, and protract with deluſions the Treaty; the <hi>Barberins</hi> on the one ſide propoſing conditions to conſume the Duke, and weary the Mediators, and the Duke on the other giving them the hearing, though reſolved to grant nothing, the better to arm himſelf, make himſelf Friends, and well impreſs his rights and intereſts in all the Courts.</p>
            <p>But the Duke of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dena</hi> quickly comprehending to what end the Treaty tended, recalls his Miniſter from <hi>Rome,</hi> and the great Duke ſhewed himſelf weary, having not been able to obtain of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> any limitation of time, and retardment of the ſentence, nor of the Duke, that, in token of obedience, he would ſend his eldeſt Son to <hi>Rome,</hi> he reſolutely refuſing to put the Succeſſor of his Country into the hands of his Enemies. The <hi>Venetians</hi> kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſilent; but the <hi>Barberins</hi> interpreting it, as in effect it was, rather an argument of diſcontent than a token of ſatisfaction in the anſwers received, repenting the harſhneſs of them, commanded the Nuntio, that he ſhould piece up the Treaty again. He with the wonted forms ſhewed, <hi>By the gaining of</hi> Caſtro, <hi>the War ended, the Popes honour ſatisfied, the Law of Juſtice fulfilled, provided the Duke would remain quiet. The Army afterwards by the aſſiſtance of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, being remarkably increaſed at</hi> Ferrara <hi>and</hi> Bologna, <hi>and Forts on this ſide the</hi> Po <hi>raiſed at</hi> Figarolo, <hi>and</hi> Melara <hi>with ſtrong Guards, the</hi> Nuntio <hi>repreſented it, as a neceſſary caution and bridle to the Dukes tranſports, who turbulent and fierce armed as if he would headily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the Pope about power, and diſpute right with his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſerved not at all to mitigate jealouſies and diſguſts; for the fortifying on the Banks of the <hi>Po</hi> was not only againſt ancient Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants with thoſe of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> but might prove of extream prejudice to the <hi>Poleſine,</hi> a Country betwixt the <hi>Adica</hi> and the <hi>Po,</hi> ſubject to the overflowings of many waters, and indowed with as much po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation and wealth, as it was deſtitute of Towns, and expoſed without other defence, but that which the nature of the ſituation with the Dikes of the Water-courſes and Rivers gives it. With all this, the Senate, not at all amuſed with the Nuntios expreſſions,

But the Duke publiſhed a long Manifeſt in print; which, though a while after anſwered by the Eccleſiaſtick party, was nevertheleſs reliſhed by the world with great applauſe, becauſe with much moderation and modeſty it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Treaties, Priviledges, and Rights, which ſupported his cauſe.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> to carry him his obedience, and thoſe motives which he had not been able to alledge in the Proceſs; but the Pope excluded his admiſſion. The publication nevertheleſs of the ſentence was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred for ſome days, not ſo much for certain terms, which they call contumacious, as, becauſe <hi>Raggi</hi> the Auditor <hi>della Camera,</hi> to whom the publication of Bulls belonged, being of the number of thoſe promoted to the Cardinalat, that charge was for ſome days vacant. In the foreſaid promotion, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> at laſt was willing, knowing that it was not his intereſt to continue for this cauſe in greater diſguſts, to flatter the Princes with exalting to the Cardinal dignity, the Prince of <hi>Eſté, Mazarine,</hi> and <hi>Peretti,</hi> named by the Emperour and both the Crowns.

               <p>The jealouſies and thoughts what would become of the affair of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> were extended alſo to Strangers, who, ſeeing the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> arm ſo eagerly, either not thinking the cauſe deſerved it, or believing, that it being eaſily compoſed they would turn themſelves to greater deſigns, endeavoured to ſtrifes to aſſure themſelves of their intentions, and draw them to their party. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in particular propounded, that, laying aſide for the preſent the diſpute of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> or agreeing it with ſome eaſie expedient, the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> ſhould unite in a League with their Crown, and concert the defence and common quiet, by upholding the preſent ſtate of things. To ſay truth, in <hi>Italy</hi> mens minds ſtood in ſuſpence, concerning the motion of the <hi>French</hi> Armies; for that in the beginning of the year, in the cold ſeaſon, the King, with the Cardinal, being come from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Lions,</hi> and the Mareſhal <hi>della Meilleray</hi> being advanced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them with a very flouriſhing Army, left it doubtful, whether ſo great a preparation tended towards <hi>Catalogna</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> And though within a while after the Forces were ſeen engaged before the Fortreſs of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> nevertheleſs the Cardinals mind was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be inclined, the place quickly taken, as he hoped, to
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:53750:264"/>
ſend the Army into <hi>Italy,</hi> before the Campania ſhould be at an end. And this he thought to do upon ſo much the better ground, by how much that in <hi>Piedmont</hi> the Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> were agreed with their Siſter-in-Law, and by conſequence declared of the <hi>French</hi> party by a Treaty; in which to <hi>Mauritio,</hi> beſides the promiſing him to Wife the Princeſs <hi>Lodovica Maria</hi> his Neece, was left in Government <hi>Niz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> with its appurtenances, as alſo to Prince <hi>Thomaſo Inurea</hi> and the <hi>Bielleſa,</hi> with title of the Dukes Lieutenant, for ſo long as the Duke remained in his minority. To the Dutcheſs remained the quality and authority of Regent, without other obligation, but to admit her Brothers-in-Law into the Council, when they ſhould be at Court, and to communicate to them the moſt weighty matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the State. With this agreement the Princes being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but the Country diſmembred, little elſe was left the Duke but the name, and that great gate of <hi>Italy</hi> was thought to be ſet wide open to the <hi>French,</hi> which was wont to be kept ſhut by the <hi>Savoyards</hi> with force, or to be opened with great caution. The <hi>French</hi> beſides had promiſed the Princes great advantages, and in particular kept <hi>Thomaſo</hi> in ſecret hopes and agreements, to aſſign him an ample part of the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> in Soveraignty, when it ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered with united Forces.</p>
               <p>To ſay truth, the Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> failed not to employ all his endeavours, to keep thoſe Princes adhering to <hi>Spain,</hi> but found, that it was in their name demanded, that, there appearing in the King of <hi>France</hi> a diſpoſition to withdraw the Garriſons from thoſe places, which in the paſt revolutions the Dutcheſs had truſted to him, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would alſo reſtore thoſe others, except <hi>Vercelli</hi> and <hi>Trino,</hi> which they might keep in their poſſeſſion till a general Peace, and ſo long as the <hi>French</hi> ſhould enjoy <hi>Pignerol</hi> and <hi>Caſal.</hi> The anſwer was ſuch as before the inſtance made had been ſuppoſed; for the Governour alledging that he kept thoſe places, the better to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a Peace, in the Treaty whereof it would be fit to ſpeak of them, refuſed to withdraw the Garriſons. Yet, though vexed at <hi>Thomaſo</hi> that he would not accept of his propoſitions, and comply with his will, he recalls ſome hundred of Souldiers out of <hi>Inurea</hi> by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate Council; but to the great joy of the Prince, who ſhaking off the yoak, cauſed the Gates to be ſhut before their face, when <hi>Sirvela</hi> repenting his overſight countermanded them, with earneſt inſtances that they might be readmitted.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the Garriſon, which with the Camp Maſter <hi>Tut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavilla</hi> was in <hi>Nizza,</hi> not willing to leave it by fair means, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by the threatnings of <hi>Mauritio,</hi> who, having aſſembled three thouſand men of the Country, put himſelf in a poſture to force them. Thus the Scene being changed in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> Fortune ſmiling on the <hi>French,</hi> ſollicited them to undertake moſt aſſured Conqueſts in <hi>Italy,</hi> and for that cauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> propoſition to cloſe in a union came to be hearkened to by the Princes of it, and more than formerly conſidered; but in the turbulent conjuncture of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conteſts, all being not able to unite themſelves in one party,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:53750:264"/>
that might be of force to withſtand Strangers, thought it a leſs evil not to adhere to any of the Crowns. Therefore were alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Propoſitions of the <hi>French,</hi> who inſtigated particularly the Pope, by remonſtrating to him the glory, and the opportunity to make advantage of ſo many Troops, raiſed for a more noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign than the gaining of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> tempting him together with the puiſſant Forces of their Crown to drive the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> which in the preſent ſtate, that that power could no longer be ſaid diſtracted but lacerated into ſo many pieces, and in a manner ruined, they repreſented eaſie to be done. To flatter him the more, they left to his arbitrement the diſpoſal of the Conqueſts, and offered the Crown of <hi>Naples</hi> to his Nephews, promiſing to be aſſiſting with ſix thouſand Foot and a Naval Army by Sea to aſſiſt the enterpriſe, eſteemed ſo much the eaſier, as that, beſides the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient intelligences with many of the Barons, the people weary of the intolerable impoſitions, deſired a change of Government.</p>

                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> knowing the propoſitions more ſpecious than eaſie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them. In this uncertain ſtate of things Monſieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> was ſent by <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> to add warmth to the offices in the cauſe of <hi>Parma,</hi> but much more to obſerve and lay hold of the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures ſeaſonable, to perſwade the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> into the party of that Crown, till Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> deſigned for that ſervice, ſhould arrive. As for <hi>Parma,</hi> the Affairs were quickly brought to a deſperate iſſue; for, there being not obtained, from the preſſing endeavours of many Princes, and thoſe which the <hi>Venetians,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted a new with ſevere anſwers, were willing to reiterate, any delay of the ſentence, after theſe accidents, which for a few days, as hath been ſaid, the order of the cauſe carried with it, <hi>Edward</hi> was declared to have incurred the greater Excommunication, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his Dominions and Fiefs, of the dignity he held of the holy See, and condemned in all charges done and to be done. In execution whereof his Palaces and the Goods in <hi>Rome</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſale, and the <hi>Camera</hi> took poſſeſſion of <hi>Caſtro, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> as yet deferring the Declaration to comprehend it in the rigorous Bulls of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> which forbid any alienation of that which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to the holy Chair. The Princes were greatly moved, as if all their inſtances had been deſpiſed by the <hi>Barberins. Edward</hi> ſtirs himſelf up ſo much the more againſt them; ſhewing therefore not the leaſt fear, calling together the Nobility and the Chief of the people, with power and eloquence deduces the cauſes of the War, the hatred of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> and his own right, exhorting them to fidelity and conſtancy. Being heard with applauſe, there were not any that promiſed not obedience. He thereupon cauſes the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons, that were Strangers, and the Biſhop of <hi>Piacenza</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his Dominion, that by obſervance of the cenſures or other means they might not ſtir up the people. <hi>Lionne</hi> paſſes to <hi>Parma</hi> and to <hi>Rome,</hi> with ſeveral propoſitions; but in the <hi>Barberins</hi> was clearly diſcovered an averſion to render, and a repugnancy in the Duke to hearken to any expedient whatſoever; becauſe to the
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:53750:265"/>
exchange, in which thoſe that interpoſed, inſiſted more than in ought elſe, and eſpecially the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> who had again diſpatched <hi>Montecucculi</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> the obſtacle was, the impoſſibility to find ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Soveraignty, which for the quality, the extent, and ſituation could be equalled to <hi>Caſtro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Marriage betwixt the <hi>Barberins</hi> and the <hi>Farneſi,</hi> which might pacifie the preſent diſguſts, and ſecure from future revenges, was projected, but in vain; ſo that the Treaty being ſuſpended anew, the <hi>Barberins</hi> only gave out, that they would aſſent to a Truce, provided both parties diſarmed: For as much as they deſpiſed the Dukes Forces, they nevertheleſs apprehended his activity and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; but he conſidering, that the expence taken away, and the jealouſie extinguiſhed, the Negotiation would be greatly cooled at <hi>Rome,</hi> refuſes to conſent to it. A breach therefore was ſpeedily drawing on, accidents frequently happening, and every day bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth diſguſts and ſuſpicions.</p>
               <p>And now mens minds were perplexed, by reaſon of a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, which afterwards was judged invented by the Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena,</hi> or at leaſt countenanced and increaſed by him, that in order to a ſuppoſed Marriage of a Daughter of the Prefect with the Duke of <hi>Mirandula,</hi> an Eccleſiaſtical Garriſon was to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that place. The report for ſome days was ſo currently believed, that from <hi>Milan</hi> the Governour ſent the Count <hi>della Riviera;</hi> from <hi>Mantua</hi> the Princeſs diſpatched her Phyſician; and the Republick cauſed to go thither <hi>Giovanni Baptiſta Battarino,</hi> Secretary of <hi>Luigi Giorgio,</hi> General <hi>di Terra firma.</hi> But it was found, that the minds of the Princeſſes, Mother and Aunt, who governed the Duke yet under age, were wholly averſe from ſuch thoughts: ſo that theſe Miniſters had nothing to do but to return, after having reconciled a certain domeſtick diſagreement of the ſame Princeſſes, which breaking forth again a while after, was again quieted by <hi>Anthonio Antelmi,</hi> Reſident for the <hi>Venetians</hi> at <hi>Mantua,</hi> whom they ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſs. But the Princeſſes from others jealouſies ſuſpecting, that, as the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> had given being to that rumour, ſo he might aim to intrude himſelf into that place by an Imperial Decree, which he gave out to have with power, to put a Garriſon into it, brought into it, if need required, to the ſatisfaction of the Borderers, ſome of the Militia of their Territory.</p>
               <p>This ſtir was ſcarce at an end, but greater emergencies were heard of; for that <hi>Montecucculi,</hi> in the deſpair of concluding any thing, being once more retired from <hi>Rome,</hi> a certain Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon arrives at <hi>Modena</hi> to amuſe the Duke with various projects of Peace, not unlike thoſe formerly diſcourſed of in <hi>Rome;</hi> but whilſt he hearkned to them, they were diſapproved by <hi>Barberino,</hi> and on a ſudden there appears at <hi>Modena,</hi> in the name of the Prefect, the Auditor of the Camp, to demand paſſage for the Army againſt <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza.</hi> The Prince was much diſturbed at it, and the other Princes his Neighbours no leſs, to whom he gave notice of it, in regard it ſeemed, that the <hi>Barberins</hi> ſcorning the interpoſitions
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:53750:265"/>
of ſo many, aimed at greater things, it being certain, that the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative drew along with it the oppreſſion of the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> with quarters and paſſage, dangers to him of <hi>Parma,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the overwhelming and confuſion of <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>Barberins</hi> nevertheleſs had other deſigns; for believing it apparent, by this rumour to ſurpriſe the Princes not yet fitted for War, they hoped in conſequence, that none daring to oppoſe them, the Duke would remain ſo frighted, that, to the end to preſerve the reſt, he would acquieſce in what he had loſt, and conſent to the Truce and diſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. He had endeavoured to raiſe ſome Souldiers; but all he could make was much leſs than what he had need of. The <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> was alſo totally unprovided, the Duke having not above a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot in pay.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Grand Duke abhorred to come to Arms but as the laſt remedy; nevertheleſs upon this advice troubled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all belief, communicating counſels with all expedition, they reſolved to paſs joynt offices with the Pope, and of the ſame tenour, to ſuſpend the March. In the ſame inſtances concurred alſo the Miniſters of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> taking this common appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion to be but the fruit promiſed him by his Nephews of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and expedition of Counſels, perſiſted ſo much the more in denying any delay, not to give time to the Duke, and to others, to take courage and to arm. The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> then grew more and more bound up not to grant the paſs, and defending himſelf with general anſwers from the demands of the Auditor, comes the Count <hi>Ambrogio Carpegna</hi> to bring him threatnings, giving him to know, that in the Quarters of <hi>Caſtel Franco,</hi> upon his Confines, the Army of between eighteen and twenty thouſand men was in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to take it by force, the Cannon mounted on the Carriages, Train in order, and all that which was needful for the March. The Duke moved at ſuch a declaration, conſents to it for a month, on the condition, <hi>That there ſhould be ſix days before the Army ſhould move, that ſo having conſidered with himſelf, he might appoint fit Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that in other four, it ſhould be out of his Confines, and ſhould march at a diſtance from his Towns and the chief City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the participation hereof to the Princes, he concealed not, that though his conſent had been extorted from neceſſity, he was as ready, if he might have aſſiſtance, to ſhew his reſentment of ſuch a violence, either by conteſting the paſs, or receiving an Army in their Reer, when they ſhould be entred into the Territories of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> He in great haſte arms three or four thouſand of his Subjects to keep the Towns, and that whilſt <hi>Edward</hi> puts himſelf into the field with a thouſand Dragoons, a thouſand two hundred Horſe, and five thouſand Foot. Having provided <hi>Puiglio,</hi> he was purpoſed to incamp upon the River <hi>Lenza</hi> to diſpute the entrance with the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificians; but his ſtrength being diſproportionable, he preſently found them alſo diminiſhed by Run-aways for want of pay. The Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> having failed him of ſuccours, which, either to draw from him advantages, or to cover his weakneſs, offered
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:53750:266"/>
him ſome men, but upon condition, that he would declare himſelf of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> party and admit a Miniſter of that Crown to reſide in his Court; he preſſes the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Grand Duke for a ſpeedy ſupply of money and men. They doubted, leſt in the Dukes Country the <hi>Barberins</hi> might have ſome ſecret intelligence, and ſome Mine might ſpring in their conſciences; ſo that the people, though they ſhewed themſelves well inclined and obedient, yet at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Pontifician Colours, Arms, and Cenſures, would remain affrighted, or at leaſt, that <hi>Edward</hi> being forced, through inequality of Forces, to ſhut himſelf up in his ſtrong places, the Country would remain in prey. Wherefore not deſiring that the Duke ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, nor that the <hi>Barberins</hi> ſhould be accuſtomed to the happy iſſue of their Counſels, they immediately ſent to <hi>Parma</hi> ſeventy thouſand Crowns; that is, the Republick forty, and the Grand Duke the reſt, and it was a ſeaſonable aſſiſtance that ſerved to incourage the Militia, and give credit to the cauſe among the Subjects, who thence conceived hopes of greater ſuccours.</p>
               <p>Offices at <hi>Rome</hi> for a ſuſpenſion being at this very time not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there were read to the Miniſters of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> by Monſignor <hi>Bichi,</hi> Auditor <hi>di Rota,</hi> in the name of <hi>Barberin,</hi> certain ambiguous anſwers, in which it ſeemed to be expreſſed, that the Pope would ſuſpend offences, when he ſhould be aſſured to receive none; but withal added, that if he poſſeſſed the Dukes Countries, he would reſtore them, when and to whom it ſhould be thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the honour of the holy See. To the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> it was plainly ſaid, that, to take away Jealouſies, a ſuſpenſion of Arms ſhould be imbraced, when by the Dukes friends promiſe ſhould be given, that he ſhould bear reſpect to the Eccleſiaſtical State, yet the Sentence for that Cauſe not to be intermitted, nor more words made of the reſtoring <hi>Caſtro,</hi> which, by reaſon of the debt to the Montiſts, and the charge of the War, the <hi>Camera</hi> reputed their own. Such anſwers ſatisfied not the Princes, and they were much more diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the inſtances, which the Prefect to the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> by <hi>Carpegna</hi> reiterated, that ſix days after, which happened to be the 10. of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in conformity to the promiſe, the paſs ſhould be open for the Army. Believing then more reſolute courſes neceſſary, and that above all the march was to be hindred, for the diverting thoſe accidents, which were apprehended from the ſucceſſes of the War, the Republick reſolved to ſend three thouſand Foot and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, under the Command of <hi>Alphonſo Anthonini,</hi> Commiſſary of the Cavalry; that joyning with two thouſand, which, under the Conduct of the Marqueſs <hi>Guicciardini,</hi> were ſent by the Grand Duke, they might defend the <hi>Modeneſe,</hi> that Duke being perſwaded to promiſe oppoſition, and diſpute the paſs with ſuch aſſiſtance, and the aſſurance, which <hi>Giovanni Baptiſta Ballarino,</hi> Secretary of the Republick, brought him, of greater ſupplies, if need ſhould require. All this had been reciprocally concerted, under promiſe and faith given, there having not been time for more expreſs Treaties; but it being judged neceſſary to conclude one, by reaſon of future caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:53750:266"/>
there arrived at <hi>Venice</hi> the Prince <hi>Luigi</hi> and the Secretary <hi>Giovanni Dominico Pandolfini,</hi> the one for the Grand Duke, and the other for the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> and the Senate deputed to treat with them <hi>Baptiſta Nani,</hi> and <hi>Vincenzo Guſſoni,</hi> Cavalier, to the end they ſhould diſcuſs the means of common defence, and the ways to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Peace. But as on the Princes ſide, and that alſo of the <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,</hi> it was believed, that with ſhewing reſolution, and by advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſome ſteps, it would be obtained; ſo each one going on in the way of ingaging, ſtumbled at laſt into a War. The <hi>Barberins</hi> were now greatly perplexed at the rumours of the Marches, and Treaties, and their Army, which, compoſed of new men, thought to go into the Country of <hi>Parma,</hi> as to an eaſie and ſecure Triumph, was inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated in ſuch ſort, that the Souldiers in great Troops running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, was in a ſhort time greatly diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>The Prefect publiſhes, that he would delay his March, and ſends <hi>Carpegna</hi> to <hi>Modena</hi> to demand, that in caſe of <hi>Edwards</hi> oppoſition he might have leave to halt in the <hi>Modeneſe.</hi> He foreſaw before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand the anſwer, which was juſt what he looked for, that the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> could no longer diſpoſe of his Country and of himſelf without participation and the conſent of the Republick and the Grand Duke; nor did he deſire it other, to the end that he might have occaſion to defer his March, and giving in that interim infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations to <hi>Rome</hi> of the ſtate of Affairs, receive Orders and alſo Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban,</hi> contrary to his belief, ſeeing by the ſtirring of the neighbour Princes the oppoſition great, calling to him the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour of <hi>France;</hi> of his own accord (for he had not at preſent been deſired) conſents to a ſuſpenſion of Arms for fifteen days. Juſt at this time happens a hurly-burly in <hi>Rome,</hi> which, though it was fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the preſent intereſts, ſerved greatly to increaſe the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the <hi>Barberins</hi> minds. And it was, that the Biſhop of <hi>Lamego,</hi> ſent Ambaſſadour from <hi>Portugal</hi> to render obedience to the Pope, although not admitted in that Quality, remaining nevertheleſs (as a Prelate) in <hi>Rome,</hi> met with the Marqueſs <hi>de los Velez,</hi> Ambaſſadour of <hi>Spain,</hi> in a certain Street, and their Retinues quarrelling, there aroſe a Skirmiſh that made ſuch a noiſe, that the <hi>French</hi> coming in to the aid of the Biſhop, in ſo great numbers, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were obliged to retire, ſome of them being killed, the Marqueſs hardly ſaving himſelf by flight.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> imputing this diſorder, though accidental, to the <hi>Barberins,</hi> becauſe they had admitted the Biſhop, and neglecting thoſe cautions which might hinder ſuch raſh confuſions, ſhewed themſelves ſo highly offended, that the Ambaſſadour went his way to <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Cardinals of the Nation, except <hi>la Queva</hi> that was ſick, retired to <hi>Fraſcati.</hi> The Emperours Ambaſſadour alſo, to ſhew an equal ſenſe in the common intereſts of the Family, goes to <hi>Albano.</hi> In <hi>Rome,</hi> a City naturally talkative, many diſcourſes were made of more dangerous conſequences, minds being inflamed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Factions of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Barberins</hi> being in trouble, were forced to ſtrengthen the Militia, and place Guards
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:53750:267"/>
with ſuch orders, as might keep the Peace. Upon this occaſion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted in mind betwixt apprehenſion and negotiation, they ſo much the more willingly promoted the ſuſpenſion of Arms; upon notice whereof the Troops of the Republick, already on their way, made a halt in the <hi>Mantuana,</hi> and the <hi>Florentines</hi> in the <hi>Luni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> thereupon bewailed himſelf that he was ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the burden of the Souldiery and of jealouſies, and the other Princes alſo perceived the dangers rather ſuſpended than ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; judging they would rather in future be ſo much the greater, by how much the <hi>Barberins</hi> diſcovered themſelves not only incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> but irritated againſt all thoſe that had declared themſelves contrary to their deſigns.</p>
               <p>The Deputies therefore of the Republick, and thoſe of the Grand Duke, and of <hi>Modena,</hi> had ſecret and frequent meetings, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Councils, and concert reſolutions, in caſe that, after the fifteen days of ſuſpenſion, the <hi>Barberins</hi> ſhould continue their march. Some were of opinion, and particularly the <hi>Modoneſe,</hi> making uſe of the preſent confuſion, to prevent and move the Army into the Eccleſiaſtical State, to disburden themſelves of their own Souldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and by bringing the <hi>Barberins</hi> to a Peace by force, ſecure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the doubt, that, having recovered courage and ſtrength, they ſhould not attempt greater and more notable revenge. They had in their aim alſo to get for their Duke out of the preſent trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſome conſiderable profit; ſo that under the countenance of the League, getting into poſſeſſion of ſomething, he might happen to do himſelf right in part of that which he pretended was detained from him by the Pontificians. But the <hi>Venetians</hi> with more diſ-intereſſed Councils, content to have ſaved the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> from invaſion, and diverted damage from the <hi>Modoneſe,</hi> aſpired not by the League to ought elſe, but to advertiſe the <hi>Barberins</hi> of the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they would have to meet with in their deſigns, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence incline them more eaſily to a Peace.</p>
               <p>To this opinion the Grand Duke at laſt adhered, though <hi>Pandolfini</hi> at firſt was bent upon attempts more reſolute. A League was then concluded betwixt the Republick, the Grand Duke, and the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> drawing the motive from the preſent making War up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> which being capable to bring greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances into <hi>Italy,</hi> the Princes deſirous to keep them off by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their own preſervation and the common Peace, united for their own defence, for mutual ſuccours, in caſe any of them were attacqued; and for that over and above, which for the defence of other <hi>Italian</hi> Princes ſhould happen to be needful, it was agreed, To make up an Army of twelve thouſand Foot and eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, whereof the half ſhould belong to the <hi>Venetians;</hi> of the reſt two thirds to the Grand Duke, and to <hi>Modena</hi> the remainder; the ſame proportion to be held in proviſions, in money, and, when there ſhould be occaſion, in the increaſing of Forces. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Army was committed to him of the Princes Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:53750:267"/>
in whoſe Country it ought to be made uſe of, and remain; but in neutral places the nomination of a General was reſerved to the Republick, with the conſent of the others. The invaded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained free from common Contributions to the Army, while he was to be vigilant with his Forces upon his own defence, to which the others were to reſort, either with ſuccours or diverſion, as ſhould be concerted at the time of need. The Contractors could not treat or conclude Peace or Truce but by common conſent, nor oblige themſelves to other Treaty, that ſhould derogate from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the Articles that were publiſhed; but there was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and kept ſecret, to aſſiſt the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> as there ſhould be need, and to admit him into the League, when he ſhould ſeek it, upon thoſe terms and conditions which ſhould then be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The expedition of the tranſaction having prevented the fame of it, the concluſion of ſuch a League was no ſooner divulged, but it was variouſly underſtood by the Princes. The <hi>Barberins</hi> ſhewed themſelves very ſuſpicious and touched with it, and the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſecretly complained, that his own Miniſters had deluded him with falſe ſuppoſitions, and ingaged his Nephews too far. On the other ſide, <hi>Edward</hi> conceived ſo much the more ſtoutneſs; for, by the protection of the League, his Countries of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> being covered, he hoped, in the aſtoniſhment of the Enemy, to open himſelf a way, either for the recovery of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> or the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſome other place that would ſerve to exchange for it. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then obtained of the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> the Paſs, he ſets forward againſt the State Eccleſiaſtick with about three thouſand men on Horſeback, men choſen for their courage; but without Foot, or Cannon, and without any proviſion whatſoever, that might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a Siege of importance. But he had good Commanders, over whom, by reaſon of his dignity, the Mareſhal <hi>d' Etré</hi> commanded, who, to ſatisfie the <hi>Barberins,</hi> being by the King of <hi>France</hi> removed from his Ambaſſage of <hi>Rome,</hi> remained with the Duke, giving cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to his Arms, and to the march, as if <hi>France</hi> by ſuch an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had concurred in it. But in truth, beſides the disburſement of a ſmall ſum of money in diſcount of his Penſions, <hi>France</hi> contributed nothing in favour of the Duke but offices: <hi>Lionne</hi> only offered him two thouſand Foot, on condition they ſhould ſerve in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but the Duke refuſed it, being jealous leſt the <hi>French</hi> ſhould ſeek anew a way to get into his places. This march greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the Grand Duke; becauſe <hi>Edward</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the War, which they with offices and appearances hoped to avoid, their fear was, leſt he, entring deep into the Eccleſiaſtick State, over-powered by the Enemy Forces ſhould periſh there, or that retiring with diſreputation in diſorder and beaten, ſhould draw after him the Popes Army into the heart of his Country.</p>
               <p>Therefore by the Senate was diſpatched to meet him <hi>Giovanni Battiſta Ballarini,</hi> who a little before had been to communicate to him the concluſion of the League, to repreſent the opinion of the
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:53750:268"/>
Confederates, and thoſe conſiderations, which by ſafe Councils, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of vain hopes, might in a ſhort time bring quiet to all, and to himſelf moſt aſſured fruits of glory. The Duke, who in communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating to the Princes his march, had alledged in excuſe his inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to keep his Troops any longer in his Country, finding himſelf now upon his way, with great faſt and confidence intermingles in his anſwer, with lively expreſſions, reaſons with his excuſes, and continues his march. The <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the Grand Duke were obliged to cauſe to enter into the <hi>Modeneſe</hi> the Troops hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining on the borders, to cover that State from the dangers, which the loſs, certainly believed of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> might bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. But <hi>Edward</hi> entring into the <hi>Bologneſe</hi> brought ſo great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to the people and to the Popes Army, that they in the unlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for accident not conſidering the ſtrength, and theſe fearing more than was their duty the danger, all was in a moment ſeen in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and diſorder. The Prefect retires flying into <hi>Ferrara.</hi> The Souldiers quit their quarters, <hi>Matthei</hi> prevailing nothing with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, authority, or command, to ſtop them, no not ſo much as a ſmall body, that might oppoſe it ſelf to the Duke, or at leaſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. Thus without Blood and without a Battel the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſſipated, <hi>Edward</hi> had an open way to a Voyage, which was one of the moſt worthy to be remembred; becauſe in an Enemies Country more could not have been done by an Army never ſo powerful.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but he might have been able by poſſeſſing ſome places to have ſetled Contributions and Quarters in the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Country, and then have negotiated the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro</hi> by exchange. But through his generous mind, aſpiring to recover it with the fame of his Arms, and carry the terrour of his name with a loud report within the very walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> he entertained his Souldiers with ſuch vaſt hopes of prey and plunder, that beſides a certain becoming familiarity, for which the Souldiers loved him without fear, and obeyed him without diſpute, every one followed him with a ſecure belief of extraordinary advantage. From Saint <hi>Ceſareo</hi> he comes in one night with his Quarters near to the City of <hi>Bologna,</hi> writing Letters to the Cardinal <hi>Durazzo</hi> Legate, and to the Inhabitants, exhorting them to perſiſt in a conſtant obedience to the holy See, himſelf alſo profeſſing an immutable duty to the ſame, and that he had not put on Arms, but in his own defence, againſt the oppreſſions of the <hi>Barberins.</hi> Notwithſtanding that populous City had no cauſe to fear an Army never ſo powerful, fear never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs was ſo great in the minds of the Citizens, that not only none went forth to diſturb the Dukes ſleep, but not to irritate him, though they omitted the offer of their ſervice, they yet anſwered with Letters of much reſpect. The day following proceeding in his way, and putting to flight with the view only ſome Companies of Souldiers, which were careleſly marching towards <hi>Bologna,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Smola</hi> ſent the Keys to meet him, the Cardinal <hi>Franci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otti,</hi> Legate of <hi>Romagna,</hi> having not been able to hinder it, the
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:53750:268"/>
City being unfurniſhed of a Garriſon, and of all ſorts of proviſions. The Duke refuſing them, contented himſelf to guard the Gates, whilſt his Troops paſſed through the Town, which was performed with ſuch order and ſo much quiet, that it ſeemed a paſſage of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were friends. <hi>Faenza</hi> made a ſhew to ſhut the Gates, but being threatned by the Duke, the Governour deſcended from the Wall to meet and pacifie him, and hardly obtained that he would content himſelf with paſſing. At <hi>Furli,</hi> which, as of a greater cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit and better inhabited, endeavoured to reſiſt, he made as though he would faſten a Petard and burn the Country round about; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Biſhop and the Guardian of the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> coming forth with tears, endeavoured to pacifie him; and he received them at diſcretion, ſaving out of grace their lives, women their honour, and the Churches. Nevertheleſs no greater hurt was done, but to lodge there one whole day to refreſh his Souldiers, from the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs and rains, whence alone aroſe ſome difficulty in his march. Victuals, for fear of pillaging and inſolences, every where abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor was there any place, which did not voluntarily offer to open their Gates. The Duke to ſhorten way, and to avoid the Eccleſiaſtick State, where by Nature and Art it is ſtrongeſt, bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Meldola,</hi> enters towards the Territory <hi>del Sole</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> to get by a ſhorter cut into the <hi>Perugino,</hi> and from thence to advance to <hi>Caſtro.</hi> At the ſame time that he arrived on the borders, he ſends to demand the Paſs of the Grand Duke, who grants it, ſeeing him engaged ſo far; but withall ſends the Marqueſs <hi>Lorenzo Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardini,</hi> to counſel him to ſtop there, or by the way of <hi>Pontremoli</hi> return to <hi>Piacenza;</hi> it ſeeming, that, without expoſing his own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and thoſe of his friends to greater hazards, that he had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently by his courage ſatisfied the world and his own glory, by mortifying the Enemy with making him appear ſo contemptible. The Duke not yet arrived half way to his deſigns, intended to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Territory of <hi>Perugio,</hi> where, at <hi>Caſtiglion del Lagó,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour making no reſiſtance, taking out four Cannons, he comes to the Town of <hi>Pieve,</hi> and condemns to contributions and to the fire a certain place, which ſhot upon ſome of his Foragers.</p>
               <p>Upon ſuch ſucceſſes fear, not to be expreſſed, increaſed in <hi>Rome;</hi> a City, which being compoſed of the baſeſt ſort of Inhabitants, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to dangers, or of Strangers, who are pleaſed with Reports, Novelties, and Accidents, ſeemed diſtracted by various affections, ſome fearing plunder, others deſiring diſorder, and all reproaching the Government. In this hurly-burly Guards were diſtributed, the command of them repartited amongſt the Prelates, hand was put to Fortifications, and other Preparations made. In <hi>Orvieto</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbo</hi> the Guards were ſtrengthened, and Souldiers levied every where, taking in <hi>Rome</hi> the Coach-Horſes to mount Souldiers. The Prefect was recalled to Court, great murmurings riſing up againſt him for having ſhewed as much baſeneſs in danger, as he exerciſed avarice in the Government. The Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> ſupplying the neceſſity with a greater vivacity goes out of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>Bali Valenzé,</hi>

a <hi>French</hi> man, but a valiant and expert Souldier, and in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces gave orders for defence. The Cardinal <hi>Franceſco</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Arts of Negotiation, thought with hopes of Peace to delude the Duke, and amuſe the League. He cauſes the Abbot of <hi>Bagni</hi> to move the Grand Dukes Ambaſſadour at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Bragadino</hi> to inſinuate to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that they would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> and at the ſame time propoſes to the Marqueſs <hi>de Fontenay</hi> the depoſiting the State of <hi>Caſtro</hi> till the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might be compoſed. But all to gain time, with equivocal and dark diſcourſes amuſes the Confederates, the Grand Duke troubling himſelf at <hi>Florence,</hi> into whoſe hand the depoſition ought to be truſted.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Rome, Bichi</hi> Auditor <hi>di Rota,</hi> preſſed the Reſident of <hi>Modena,</hi> that the depoſition accompliſhed, the League would then declare for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban. Vitelli</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> in a diſcourſe more prolix and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous, to diſcredit the Mediation of the <hi>French</hi> ſhewed their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be ſuſpicious, as if, aſpiring to have <hi>Caſtro</hi> in depoſito, they were not afterwards, by reaſon of the conveniency of the ſituation, ſo eaſily to let it go, and inſinuated, that the Pope would much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truſt it to the Republick. But he had no ſooner named that offer, but turning his diſcourſe another way, aſſured, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients for a Compoſure were eaſie and many, if there were any at <hi>Rome</hi> that would manage them with ſincerity, or had powers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conclude them. All this tended to induce the Senate to ſend an Ambaſſadour to <hi>Rome;</hi> for the <hi>Barberins,</hi> repenting more and more to have rejected the inſinuations, had now commanded him to ſollicite it. The Senate comprehending, their will, at preſent forced by fear, would not laſt longer than the fear it ſelf, ſhewed to deſire, before they reſolved, more preciſe and leſs obſcure propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide the Grand Duke judging, that in this wambling of their minds fear had prevailed over animoſity, cloſes with the buſineſs, declaring, that it might be depoſited in the League, or at leaſt in one of the Confederates, or in the <hi>Genouſe,</hi> neutral and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſſed perſons. At the ſame time his Army of eight thouſand Foot and a thouſand Horſe with twenty two pieces of Cannon, came near to the Borders, putting the <hi>Barberins</hi> into great doubt, leſt he would make uſe of the time, either to do himſelf right in certain pretenſions he had, or ſhew his reſentment of former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtes. But he had no aim but to procure Peace; and by the means of the Prince <hi>Matthias</hi> his Brother, rather to perſwade the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> to retire out of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> by offering him Quarters, to the end, that remaining ingaged in the Eccleſiaſtick State he might not receive ſome blow, which putting courage again into the <hi>Barberins,</hi> might render the Treaty more difficult. <hi>Edward</hi> would not take this counſel; but quartering betwixt <hi>Monte Pulciano</hi> and <hi>Chiuſi,</hi> kept the Country in fear and contribution, publiſhing, that the Prince <hi>Franceſco Maria,</hi> his Brother, was coming through <hi>Tuſcany</hi> to ſtrengthen him with four thouſand Foot and five hundred Horſe.
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:53750:269"/>
The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> ſollicited the <hi>Venetians</hi> to give him leave, with their Troops, which he had in his Country, to enter into the <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi> which being all in confuſion, and without a Garriſon, an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity was offered for conſiderable progreſs, in recompence of that much, he pretended to be due to him from the Pope. But the Senate denied their aſſent to his requeſt, and rather earneſtly diſſwaded him from adding imbroilments to the buſineſs, and fire to the flame, which it was ſo ſtudiouſly endeavoured to adjuſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> was not wanting to himſelf in any cunning, and aiming not only to negotiate with the Princes of the League, but withal to give them jealouſie, propoſed to the Vice-King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> to unite the Pope with the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, taking it for a diſſembled propoſition, believed, that he was rather reſolved to cloſe with <hi>France,</hi> and endeavoured alſo to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the ſuſpicion in the Princes Confederates, that the <hi>French,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving together with Prince <hi>Thomaſo</hi> eaſily poſſeſſed <hi>Creſcentino</hi> and <hi>Nizza de la Paglia,</hi> would at preſent beſiege <hi>Tortona,</hi> in deſign to come nearer to <hi>Piacenza,</hi> and what with jealouſie and force oblige the Duke to yield <hi>Caſtro.</hi> Theſe Treaties having caſt in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays in the proceedings of Duke <hi>Edward,</hi> who no leſs than the Grand Duke was in great hopes to end them with advantage and honour, Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> had diligently got together twelve thouſand Foot and three thouſand Horſe, people raiſed in haſte, and little inured to War; but commanded by good Officers, who were of opinion, it was beſt not to hazard them ſo ſoon to a Battel, much leſs not to think ſo meanly of them, as to retire with them under the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> but advancing ſlowly with them, under the countenance of Towns of <hi>Orvieto</hi> and <hi>Viterbo</hi> to ſtraighten <hi>Edward</hi> in his Victuals and Quarters. <hi>Barberino</hi> ſeconded the counſel; whereupon the Cardinal <hi>Spada,</hi> diſpatched to the Confines with Title of Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary, ſhewed all poſſible readineſs for an agreement. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Depoſition, there ſeemed not any further controverſie; but the thing treated of was concerning the manner: For the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had plainly told <hi>Lionne,</hi> that he would not conſent to the depoſiting but with ſecurity, that it ſhould be reſtored to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a prefixed time; and Cardinal <hi>Spada</hi> affirmed, that for a certain appearance of honour he could not condition that; but that, either with a tacite conſent, or declaring it in the ear of the Depoſitary, he would let paſs the effect. <hi>Lionne</hi> about this was obliged to many Voyages to one and the other, and in this while <hi>Barbarino</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to amuſe the Grand Duke with ſeveral queſtions; whether with the depoſition the League would be content; whether that done, it would declare it ſelf in favour of the Pope; whether the depoſition was to be in the <hi>French,</hi> or in the League, and in that caſe, where were the Miniſters to agree the conditions of it?</p>
               <p>The Grand Duke perceived, all tended to delays; nevertheleſs anſwered, that the end of the Princes united being to reſtore <hi>Edward</hi> to his States and to the Popes favour, they with the effect thereof
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:53750:270"/>
would certainly be contented: They were alſo ready to receive the <hi>Depoſitum,</hi> and the other Miniſters being not arrived, offered himſelf, remembring, that all good conſiſted in expedition. In the mean while the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> being gone to <hi>Aqua-pendente,</hi> a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſituate high, and defended with a good Garriſon, obtained it of the Governour, that let himſelf be overcome with fear, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. The Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> then putting great Garriſons into the Towns, advances with ſeven thouſand Foot and two thouſand Horſe from <hi>Viterbo</hi> to <hi>Montefiaſcone</hi> to ſtraighten the Duke, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his entry into the State of <hi>Caſtro.</hi> He made alſo two motions towards <hi>Aqua-pendente;</hi> but the Duke making a ſhew to get on Horſe back and to advance towards him, though with Forces ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, the Cardinal retired, chuſing rather to overcome with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, than run the hazard of Fortune. But the Duke diſlodging from that Quarter for want of Forrage, and ſetling at <hi>Ponte Centino,</hi> the Eccleſiaſtick Army alſo takes up their Quarters at <hi>San Lorenzo delle Grotte.</hi> The rains, (it being the month of <hi>October</hi>) greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated thoſe of <hi>Parma,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Barberins</hi> pretended ſo much the more to tire them with delays, ſhewing, to gain more time, to incline to the depoſition into hands of the League, but that there were no Miniſters with whom the Conditions might be nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated. To take away the pretext, the Grand Duke comes himſelf to <hi>San Quirico</hi> upon the Confines. The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> ſends thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Fulvio Teſti,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> more out of complacency to the others than for any thought that the Treaty would ſucceed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched thither <hi>Angelo Cornaro,</hi> Cavalier, who was Proveditor of the Militia in the <hi>Modeneſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before he came, the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> the Prince <hi>Matthias,</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti,</hi> with <hi>Monſieur de Lionne,</hi> had expreſſed themſelves in writing, that their ultimate intention was, <hi>That all that which within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> Rome <hi>belonged to the Houſe of</hi> Farneſe, <hi>ſhould be delivered in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſito to the Duke of</hi> Modena, <hi>to render it ſome time in</hi> December <hi>next to whom it of right belonged; that the League, over and above the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of</hi> Caſtro, <hi>and the dependencies on it, ſhould declare to pretend nothing elſe; that with the anſwer the aſſent was expected within the term of two days only; that all delay or alteration was to be interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a refuſal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Pope ſhewing his diſlike of ſuch a form, and the Grand Duke himſelf not approving it, as too ſevere, the Treaty was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for ſome days. The Cardinal <hi>Spada</hi> cooperating with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> to keep the Negotiation on foot as long as might be, ſends by the Father <hi>Virgilio,</hi> of the Congregation of the Oratory, his Brother, to offer the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> that the Pope, <hi>Out of his own Clemency, the interceſſion of ſo many Princes, and for the ſparing of the people, ſhould abſolve him from the Excommunication, and</hi> Caſtro <hi>being delivered in depoſito to the Duke of</hi> Modena <hi>for ſix months, ſhould within that time by common conſent be reſtored to the firſt Owner, and the Revenue be depoſited to pay the Montiſts, the new Fortifications be demoliſhed, and the Arms and Ammunition brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:53750:270"/>
the place be withdrawn, on condition that the Duke ſhould retire into</hi> Lombardy, <hi>without touching upon the State Eccleſiaſtick, and ſhould diſarm; the Confederates were only to declare themſelves herewith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and remove their Troops from the Eccleſiaſtick Confines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke, as to the abſolution, refers himſelf to that which <hi>France</hi> ſhould demand, and to the Judgment of the ſame left the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, whether all the Fortifications or only the Out-works of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro</hi> ſhould be demoliſhed. He only inſiſted on the ſecurity, that <hi>Caſtro</hi> ſhould be reſtored by the Depoſitary. And that ſeemed to be out of doubt; becauſe the Cardinal <hi>Spada</hi> had ſeveral times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated to <hi>Lionne,</hi> that he would tacitely give his conſent to it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Dukes therefore of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Modena</hi> paſſed an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and writing to perform it before the preſent year ſhould be at an end. The accord then being held for ſecure, <hi>Lionne</hi> publiſhes it for concluded, and <hi>Edward</hi> gives notice of it to the Confederates. But while he looked that <hi>Lionne</hi> ſhould bring it to him ſigned, he gave him to underſtand, that the Cardinal <hi>Spada</hi> avoided ſubſcribing it, alledging for a pretext, that it was not fit for him to do it, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a force and with Arms in hand: That he propoſed therefore a ſuſpenſion of Arms for five days, and becauſe the Duke was reduced to ſuch a want of Victuals and Forrage, that he could ſubſiſt no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, offers him Quarters betwixt the Rivers <hi>Paglia</hi> and <hi>Chiani.</hi> But recalling ſoon after the offer, two miles of deſolate Country were offered him, from whence every thing neceſſary for the food of man, the Hay being firſt burnt, had been carried away. It is not eaſie to imagine, how <hi>Edward</hi> ſtormed, and how highly, being fiery by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he was moved with ſuch proceedings; but of his Troops ſome had periſhed for want, others after great Booties had diſbanded. And for the reſt, there was not wherewithal to feed them, nor did the ſeaſon permit to advance further, or to keep the field. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves then to retire into his own Country, and demanded paſſage of the Grand Duke, who blaming this haſty departure out of the Eccleſiaſtical State, as a fault equal to the unſeaſonable haſte of his entring into it, offers him in his own for ſome days Victuals and Quarters, as being doubtful, leſt the <hi>Barberins,</hi> delivered from their apprehenſions, ſhould turn the Treaty topſie-turvy. <hi>Edward</hi> vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Grand Duke, with ſuperfluous hopes of Peace, had firſt withheld him from advancing in the ſudden fear to the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> and afterwards had denied to ſecond him with his Arms to advance to <hi>Caſtro,</hi> deſpiſing the offers, and leaving the Mareſhal <hi>d' Eſtré,</hi> who at leiſure brought back the remainder of his men, paſſes Poſt into <hi>Lombardy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all this, the Cardinal <hi>Spada,</hi> though he had gained his intent, did not preſently break the Treaty; but making his Brother the inſtrument, propoſes to the Grand Duke the ſame conditions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſent to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> with very little alteration, ſave that he deſired, for obſervance of what was agreed, the League ſhould oblige it ſelf. His aim was to beget ſome diſguſts betwixt the Mediators; for <hi>Lionne</hi> had already declared, that it was diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:53750:271"/>
for <hi>France,</hi> that other caution, beſides that of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſhould be demanded. The expedient for this appeared eaſie, becauſe in the capitulation, leaving the appearance and the honour to the <hi>French,</hi> he propoſed that with a Writing apart the League ſhould warrant the Treaty. Greater difficulties aroſe from the variety of propoſitions; for, the <hi>Barberins</hi> ſucceeding not in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the Vice-Roy of <hi>Naples</hi> to hearken to a Treaty for a League, leſs to afford the aſſiſtance which they asked, as was due by the Fief of that Kingdom, nor yet to permit any of its Subjects to go to their ſervice, they perſwaded him at laſt to propound a ſuſpenſion of Arms, for which he diſpatches Courriers to <hi>Venice</hi> and to the Grand Duke, preſſing that they would perſwade <hi>Edward</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it.</p>
               <p>At this time that the Nuntio in <hi>Naples</hi> laboured with the Vice-Roy that he would intereſt himſelf in the Treaty, and that to the Grand Duke were inſinuated in the name of <hi>Barberino</hi> propoſitions of a League of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, in it comprehending the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards;</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Spada</hi> entertained <hi>Lionne</hi> in a diſcourſe of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to employ ſo many Armies ready and at hand in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> of which ſo conſiderable a part might be given to <hi>Edward,</hi> that <hi>Caſtro</hi> would be no great matter to leave if he would to the Prefect. Betwixt the Grand Duke and <hi>Parma</hi> jealouſies were alſo ſown with great art; endeavouring to make the former believe, that <hi>Edward,</hi> for the obtaining of his own, offered to invade together with the Pope <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> and to the latter, that the other offered to abandon him, ſo <hi>Caſtro</hi> it ſelf might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to him. Artifice always halting in ſome part, ſuch projects were at the ſame time publiſhed and laught at; and the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates would not ſo much as propoſe to <hi>Edward</hi> the ſuſpenſion of Arms, judging it better to inſiſt upon the accord, ſo far advanced, that neither party could go back without a publick blemiſh.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the Cardinal <hi>Spada</hi> was more and more wavering in his propoſals, the Ambaſſadors of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Tuſcany</hi> thought fit clearly to inform themſelves of the Popes true intentions, by ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him expreſly about it. He at the mentioning of the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhewing it to be near to him, at firſt troubled and afterwards perplexed, at laſt not averſe from conſigning it to the League, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that the Cardinal <hi>Spada</hi> had powers to treat, but not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude. In concluſion, <hi>Spada,</hi> having put to paper the Articles of a Treaty, together with the Marqueſs <hi>Riccardi</hi> the Grand Dukes Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and <hi>Teſti,</hi> and ſent them to <hi>Rome; Barbarino</hi> in addition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes three points, not only contrary to the things hitherto nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, but alſo not poſſibly to be admitted by the Confederates. It had always been taken for granted, that <hi>France</hi> ſhould demand of the Pope abſolution and pardon for the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> to the end to avoid many intricacies, and thoſe prejudices, which <hi>Edward</hi> feared for his intereſts in future. But the Cardinal now propoſes, that he himſelf ſhould demand it, that the Montiſts beſides ſhould be paid; which the Duke refuſed not, when their right ſhould be
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:53750:271"/>
reſtored to its firſt ſtate. Laſtly, that the Princes of the League ſhould declare themſelves ſatisfied, not only for the Affairs of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro,</hi> but renounce all other pretenſions and intereſts which they had with the Church. This condition ſeemed to the Confederates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable, buſineſſes and rights of great concernment being there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der comprehended, which being already of very ancient ſtanding, if hitherto they had not been promoted by Arms, ought leſs in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to diſturb the Peace, and ſo much the rather, that being not mentioned or comprehended in the League, they had no reference to the preſent ſubject, in which, <hi>Caſtro</hi> being reſtored, they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelves intirely ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>By this it clearly appeared, that danger ceaſing, put an end to the fraud; whereupon the Princes themſelves, incenſed at this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and vexed at the deluſion, the Aſſembly was diſſolved, after which the Confederates concealed not their ſharp reproaches againſt <hi>Lionne,</hi> who had not ſufficiently made ſure of the Powers, and he the ſame againſt <hi>Spada,</hi> who by ſhewing him a falſe Copy of them, had deceived him. Many doubted, whether the ſaid Cardinal was in truth the deceiver or the deceived, and upon it ſeveral Manifeſts and Writings ran to and fro. But the Confederates looking at the iſſue of the buſineſs more than at the formality, and aſcribing every thing to the <hi>Barberins,</hi> conſidered how to reſent it. The Grand Duke therefore and the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> looked with ſome reflection in this Conjuncture upon the proceedings of the <hi>French,</hi> ſince that, by the gaining of <hi>Tortona,</hi> though under the name of Prince <hi>Thomaſo,</hi> to whom it was ſaid it was to be granted in Soveraignty, it was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that their Arms were ſilently entred into <hi>Italy,</hi> and were Neighbours to the Confines of many Princes; ſo that thoſe of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> party juſtly apprehended, and that not without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, to be over powred by that Crown. Nevertheleſs, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the recent ſcorns of the <hi>Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins</hi> prevailing, (beſides that with the death of the Cardinal <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> happened about the end of the year, many of his deſigns were thought extinguiſhed) they ſhewed themſelves as reſolute not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their injuries, as the <hi>Barberins</hi> were conſtant in provoking them to it. The Dukes then of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Parma</hi> having ſpoken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther communicated to the <hi>Venetians</hi> their thought to take up ſome Quarters in the Eccleſiaſtick State, to eaſe their own Country du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Winter, deſiring, that at leaſt by connivence they would give way to them to make uſe of the Souldiers of the Republick which were in the <hi>Modoneſe.</hi> The Senate and the Grand Duke not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, that the one ſhould be expoſed to greater dangers, and the other be ſeparated from common counſels, exhorted them to ſuſpend moving in ſo cold a Winter-ſeaſon, in which delay took not away any vigor from their power, but rather added ſtrength to their counſels. The Dukes were ſatisfied with it, chiefly becauſe at the inſtant of their ſetting forward <hi>Modena</hi> had diſcovered, that by the impriſonment and death of ſome, an intelligence was vaniſhed, which he had in <hi>Ferrara;</hi> whither having ſent certain of his Subjects, under
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:53750:272"/>
other names to inrool themſelves in a Company, they, having the Guard at a Port, were to deliver it to the Duke. Beſides, he of <hi>Parma,</hi> whoſe aim was to poſſeſs <hi>Cento,</hi> a place, which from the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Bologna</hi> might draw important Contributions, was diverted by Cardinal <hi>Anthonio,</hi> come into thoſe parts with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority of Legate, and by his providing and fortifying that place.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe things were in agitation, the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſent into the <hi>Sacca di Goro,</hi> to maintain the Juriſdiction of the Sea, certain armed Parks, which finding there ſome Veſſels laden with Corn and Oyl, had, as is uſual, ſent them to <hi>Venice,</hi> from which <hi>Ferrara</hi> and the Army finding ſome inconvenience of Victuals, certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts were raiſed by the Pontificians betwixt <hi>Magnavacca</hi> and <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> with eight pieces of Cannon on them to protect Ships under their countenance; but being found of no advantage, they within a while demoliſhed them. And now through the diſpoſitions of minds and preparation of Forces, all really tended to War; whereupon the Prince <hi>Luigi,</hi> and <hi>Pandolfini,</hi> being returned to <hi>Venice,</hi> Meetings were again renewed with the Deputies <hi>Nani</hi> and <hi>Guſſoni.</hi> The <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berins</hi> endeavoured to render them ſuſpect to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting, that the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were not ſo much united for the affairs of <hi>Caſtro</hi> as to form a third Party, that might ballance their Arms, and ingage it ſelf as occaſion ſhould be offered, as if their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention were to give Law to both the Crowns, and continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> projects of a League, upon which, and to have a pretext to introduce a Miniſter, the Regent <hi>Caſanate</hi> was ſent by the Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> But he no ſooner arrives there, but the Cardinal <hi>Barberino</hi> being now out of fear, he found him far from his own propoſitions, and rather involved in a like Treaty with <hi>France,</hi> though his more veritable intentions were to amuſe both the Crowns without concluding with either. The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> to flatter him, gave him hopes, that by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbans</hi> cloſing in a League with them, the Authority of the Catholick King would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Modena</hi> and the Grand Duke to facilitate the adjuſtment of <hi>Caſtro;</hi> and the Count <hi>della Rocca,</hi> gone already from <hi>Venice,</hi> was going to <hi>Florence,</hi> to <hi>Modena,</hi> and to <hi>Parma,</hi> to exhort thoſe Princes to Peace, with offer of his Mediation, and with propoſitions to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> that if he would adhere to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> party, he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> by recompenſing the Prefect with other Lordſhips in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> All this fell quickly to nothing; for the projects of the <hi>Barberins</hi> to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> varied from the firſt intention, and thoſe of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the Princes had no foundation.</p>
               <p>In the mean time foreign affairs were carried on with important accidents, things in <hi>Germany</hi> being reduced to great extremity, by ſeveral blows of conſequence given to the Imperial Armies; one near the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where by Count <hi>Guebrian,</hi> General of the <hi>Weimarians, Lamboy</hi> was totally defeated; another in <hi>Sileſia, Franc Albert,</hi> a Duke of <hi>Saxe Lawemburg,</hi> being beaten and taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

to whom, though a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> the Emperour had given the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of an Army, in hopes that many Souldiers of that belief would willingly ſerve under his Command, and thoſe would flock to him of the contrary party, in which he had been a Commander for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years. In conſequence of which diſaſter, <hi>Olmitz,</hi> the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of <hi>Moravia,</hi> and other places were given up to the <hi>Swedes.</hi> Yet it would not have been difficult to have repaired all, if the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, who with the greateſt body of the Army beſieged <hi>Leipzich,</hi> a City fatal to great Battels, had not by <hi>Torſtenſon,</hi> who came to attempt its relief, been utterly defeated; whereupon, the Patrimonial Provinces remaining without defence, and the way free for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my even to <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſo great was the conſternation of mens minds in that City, that nothing elſe preſerved it, but the ſpreading of the <hi>Swedes</hi> in proſecution of their advantage.</p>
               <p>The Emperour therefore commanding his Ambaſſadour to return to <hi>Rome,</hi> deſired ſuccours of the Pope; and <hi>Rabbata</hi> at <hi>Venice</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of the Senate with unwonted and great earneſt three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot to defend the Paſſes of the <hi>Danube</hi> and the City of <hi>Vien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> that the Army of the <hi>Swedes</hi> being by that means ſtopped, it might not come nearer, with the wonted inſolency of Conquerors, to <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Confines of the Republick. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> denies aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, under the pretext of the jealouſies wherein he was, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> anſwered in a ſenſe little differing, ſhewing how <hi>Italy</hi> was diſturbed and overturned by the <hi>Barberins. Monſieur de Lionne</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo come to <hi>Venice,</hi> declared the Fortune and the Power of the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> every where laid low; exalted the intention of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> who, not ambitious but of glory to himſelf and liberty to others, had conquered <hi>Tortona</hi> by Arms, and in Generoſity given it up to Prince <hi>Thomaſo</hi> He invited to an Union with <hi>France</hi> and to the Conqueſt of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> of which he offered to the Republick ſuch a portion as it ſelf would chuſe. But the Senate perſiſted fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not to intereſt it ſelf betwixt the Crowns otherwiſe than in what concerned the Mediation of Peace.</p>
               <p>Beſides the proceedings in <hi>Italy,</hi> which are before mentioned, the accidents are worthy relating concerning the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Arms being every where victorious without the Kingdom, it was nevertheleſs inteſtinely diſturbed with furious commotions. <hi>Richelieu,</hi> heaping up for himſelf and thoſe that depended on him vaſt riches, rendred the univerſal poverty of the Kingdom ſo much the more intolerable to the people; and by vainly boaſting his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and preferring his own Glory before that of the King, made himſelf burdenſom and maligned. <hi>Lewis</hi> was naturally ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but timid; whence, Princes having no Guards that can preſerve them from diſquiet, he was perpetually tortured in his mind, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with jealouſie at the exceſſive power of the Miniſter, and at others, with the grief at the neceſſity to ſuffer him. The Cardinal, to ſpy out his intentions, kept him environed with his Confidents, which reported to him his words and the tendencies of them. The King inclined to amuſe himſelf very often privately at home, as it
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:53750:273"/>
were to vent his affections with ſome of his Familiars; whereupon the Cardinal eaſily inſinuated into his favour <hi>Monſieur de Saint Mars,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>d'Effiat,</hi> and promoted him, in the flower of his years, to the Charge of Grand Eſcuyer, which in that Court they call <hi>Monſieur le Grand,</hi> with ſo great a ſuite of propitious Fortune that in a ſhort time the Kings affection roſe to ſuch a height, as to obſcure the chief Miniſter, and render the confident young man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring to high things.</p>
               <p>The enterpriſe on <hi>Perpignan</hi> being reſolved, the Cardinal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades the King to go thither, carrying along with him the Queen and his Brother, and leaving the little Children kept in the <hi>Bois de Vincennes,</hi> the Governour whereof was <hi>Monſieur de Chavigni.</hi> Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the people all the Court murmured, that the Cardinal, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing from the Kings weak health his death to be near, by carrying him together with the Queen and <hi>Orleans</hi> to the Army that depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, and was commanded by <hi>la Meilleray</hi> his Nephew, and by leaving the Sons depoſited in the power of his Confident, aimed in all events to diſpoſe of the Regency, nay of the Royal Family and the Kingdom. But the Queen, oppoſing her tears to the Cardinals counſels, obtained to remain at St. <hi>Germans</hi> with her little Sons. The King recommending the Government of <hi>Paris</hi> to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the defence of the Frontiers of <hi>Flanders</hi> with an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Army to the Counts of <hi>Harcourt</hi> and <hi>de Guiſche,</hi> departs; the Mareſhal <hi>la Meilleray,</hi> always choſen by the Cardinal for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of greateſt moment, being advanced before. <hi>Perpignan,</hi> but a little diſtant from the Sea and from the <hi>Pirenees,</hi> is the chief City of <hi>Roſſiglion,</hi> conſiderable for the exact Fortifications both of Town and Citadel, and at preſent provided with a numerous Garriſon. To take it therefore by force, being thought no eaſie matter, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to block it, and by hindring it of Victuals, to overcome it with Famine. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> with four thouſand Muſquetiers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from <hi>Colivre</hi> a great Convoy into it; whereupon it was found neceſſary to ſhut that door of the Sea, by poſſeſſing that place, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the Marqueſs <hi>di Mortara</hi> with three thouſand men. The preparations and the motion of the King of <hi>France</hi> had given great apprehenſions throughout all <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But amidſt ſo many diſturbances, the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke publiſhes in the Court a certain <hi>Henrico</hi> for his natural Son, till now not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, but in ſuch ſort caſt off, that, taking a deſperate Voyage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Indies,</hi> he had paſſed ſeveral years there in ſordid and baſe courſes. But now <hi>Olivares,</hi> to vent a certain Genius of Ambition and Power, introduces him with great expence and equipage into the Kings Service; the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile</hi> being perſwaded to give him his Daughter to Wife, to the ſcandal of the other Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees, who in <hi>Spain</hi> are not wont to prefer the Idol of Favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Nobleneſs of Blood. Afterwards deſiring to cover his own extravagancy, by having the King emulate his example, ſeduces him to declare <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> for his Son, then but thirteen years of age, born of a mean Woman, and obſcurely brought up, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:53750:273"/>
upon him the Title of Generaliſſimo againſt <hi>Portugal,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of a certain Council. All this was attended with the ſcorn and murmuring of many, that in the greateſt preſſures of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, diſtraction was ſeen in mens minds, and the Treaſures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in actions and expences, both unprofitable and unworthy, to the abandoning of the Kingdoms, and contempt of the lawful Heir, which was yet kept under the care, and might well be ſaid capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, of <hi>Olivares</hi>'s own Wife. The clamours and wiſhes of all ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the King to go out of <hi>Madrid,</hi> and draw near to the Frontiers, whilſt he of <hi>France</hi> was heard to be arrived at <hi>Narbon,</hi> to the end, that if the one came in perſon for conqueſt, the other would at leaſt ſhew himſelf a far off for defence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olivares</hi> doubtful, leſt the King going forth ſhould either get light how affairs ſtood, or that others ſhould inform him of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity of his governing, ſometimes with artifice hiding the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and then exaggerating the inconveniencies, and above all the expence, which the Kings moving neceſſarily required, endeavoured to ſtop him. The King nevertheleſs, his will at this time over-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtering that of the Favourites, reſolves to go to <hi>Saragozza,</hi> but with ſuch a ſlow pace, that, going out of <hi>Madrid</hi> not with a military Equipage, but rather for divertiſement with delightful Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Players, ſometimes ſtaying to delight himſelf with them, ſometimes going out of the way, and always making very little Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, arrives late, and yet the motion of the Army was much later. <hi>Colivre</hi> not being able to expect ſo much delays, the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that at any rate it ſhould be relieved, and the Fleet being not yet ready, that it ſhould be attempted by a ſelect body of Horſe by Land. The execution proved more difficult than the command; for there was a neceſſity to croſs over <hi>Catalogna,</hi> with the Rivers and Mountains between, without Victuals, with the Enemy, in the Flank and Reer of them. However the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke, far from the danger, and accuſtomed in things of difficulty to arrogate to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf whatever had a proſperous iſſue, and where it fell out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to lay the blame of it on Fortune or the Inſtruments, preſſed that it ſhould be hazarded, though with never ſo great appearance of loſs. So that making choice of three thouſand men on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, the moſt part reformed Officers, under the Marqueſs <hi>de Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uar,</hi> the paſſage was attempted; but <hi>Monſieur de la Mothe Odancourt</hi> following them, and the Peaſants withholding Victuals, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the ways, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> quickly found themſelves without bread and without Forrage, in the Mountains ſo beſet, that there being no means of coming to fight nor to eſcape, they in a body render themſelves with Colours, Arms and Horſes, Priſoners. Thus the beſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces being blaſted without blood, thoſe of <hi>Colivre</hi> yet continued the defence, till <hi>la Meilleray</hi> piercing into the Wall with a Mine blew up the Aqueduct; whereupon for want of water they capitulated, together with the Caſtle of St. <hi>Elmo,</hi> lying cloſe by and upon a height. And now the Siege was laid before <hi>Perpignan,</hi> honoured with the preſence of King <hi>Lewis,</hi>
                  <pb n="534" facs="tcp:53750:274"/>
whilſt the Cardinal at <hi>Narbonne</hi> was indiſpoſed with pain in an arm, which almoſt withered by blood-letting and by ſcars, had for a long time tormented him. The <hi>French</hi> thought the enterpriſe would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed well, and not laſt long, ſuppoſing that there would be found a want of Victuals in the place. But the Marqueſs <hi>Flores d' Avila,</hi> the Governour, gave them out with ſuch exactneſs, and concealed them, expreſly to ſtrengthen that opinion, that for that cauſe the place would quickly be taken; that ſo the <hi>French</hi> being deceived in their hopes, might ſpare blood and force, and by prolonging the Siege, time might be given for its relief.</p>
               <p>Holding out therefore ſome months, affairs in <hi>Flanders</hi> proceeded happily for the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for that <hi>Melo,</hi> not able for the diſtance to ſend ſuccours into <hi>Spain,</hi> endeavoured to give them aid by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, finding his Army twenty five thouſand ſtrong, and with all things elſe well provided. So that he eaſily recovered <hi>Lens,</hi> and <hi>la Baſſee</hi> was rendred to him. Dividing his Army, he afterwards threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to invade <hi>France</hi> in two ſeveral parts; and to oppoſe them, the <hi>French</hi> Army being ſeparated into two bodies, he on a ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns his own, and falls upon the Count <hi>de Guiſche</hi> in his Quarters, which near <hi>Chaſtelet</hi> he negligently kept. The Count ſaved himſelf by flight, leaving the Camp with that which was in it in prey to the Enemy. From that ſide which is much expoſed, <hi>Melo</hi> might have gone even to <hi>Paris;</hi> and ſome counſelled him to it, to promote in the Kings far abſence confuſions and tumults in that vaſt City. Others were of opinion, that he ſhould carry the Army to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and repair thoſe diſadvantages, which after the defeat of <hi>Lamboy</hi> the Catholicks ſuſtained by the <hi>Weimarians. Melo</hi> having expreſs commands from the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke not to ingage the Army in ought that might divert the Forces from thoſe vaſt deſigns he framed to himſelf, deſtroys the benefit of the Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Olivares</hi> built upon the intelligence held with <hi>Monſieur le Grand,</hi> who changing into hatred the benefit of his raiſing, ſtudied revenge againſt the Cardinal, becauſe he had hindred him of the honour of being admitted into the ſecret Council, of the Title of Duke and Peer, and of the Marriage with the Princeſs <hi>Maria</hi> of <hi>Nevers.</hi> He had obſerved in his confidences with the King, that <hi>Richelieu</hi> was become troubleſom to him, and by conſequence was rather tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than loved, nay he affirms, that <hi>Lewis</hi> had ſecretly given him leave to make uſe of the means that might ruine the Cardinal. But wanting experience, and tranſported with ambition, he fails in chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the way. Finding himſelf to want a party; (for the private favour of the King was not ſufficient to defend him againſt the publick Authority which the Cardinal had the management of;) he ſeeks to make other friends, and before he went with the King from <hi>Paris,</hi> he contracts friendſhip, <hi>Monſieur de Thou</hi> being the inſtrument, with the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and both ſtrengthned themſelves afterwards with <hi>Orleans,</hi> to have the applauſe and name of a Prince of the Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orleans,</hi> beſides the impatience of a private life, was irritated againſt the Cardinal, both for old buſineſſes and for a new ſuſpicion,
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:53750:274"/>
that upon the Kings death he had thoughts to aſſume the Regency to himſelf. It was therefore reſolved to be rid of him by all means, and <hi>Bouillon</hi> offering <hi>Sedan</hi> for a place of Retreat, it came to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that men, money and credit, to ſupport themſelves and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to undertake, was wanting. To obtain the means for it, they ſend into <hi>Spain Monſieur de Frontailles,</hi> who in the greateſt ſecrecy concluded a Treaty, in which under the pretext of promoting the general Peace and the Service of King <hi>Lewis</hi> himſelf, who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be oppreſſed by the Cardinal, it was agreed; <hi>That when</hi> Orleans <hi>ſhould be come to</hi> Sedan, <hi>the Catholick King ſhould deliver to him twelve thouſand Foot and five thouſand Horſe, with four hundred thouſand Crowns to make new Levies and neceſſary proviſions of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Cannon. Over this Army was to command the Duke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, aſſiſted with two Mareſhals of the Field, which ſhould be</hi> Bouillon <hi>and St.</hi> Mars; <hi>that of</hi> Flanders <hi>was by a good concert to ſecond their undertaking. To the Duke, with the aſſiſtance of a</hi> Spaniſh <hi>Miniſter, ſhould be permitted to grant Peace or Neutrality with thoſe Provinces of the Kingdom that would demand it; excluding nevertheleſs the general Peace betwixt the Crowns, which was not to be made but by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and with reſtitution to the</hi> Spaniards <hi>of all that was taken. Laſtly, that</hi> Orleans <hi>ſhould be obliged to declare againſt the</hi> Swedes, <hi>and againſt all thoſe which were Enemies to the</hi> Auſtrians.</p>
               <p>The Contractors by this Treaty aimed much further than at the ruine alone of the Cardinal; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> aſpired at the diſcord and diviſion of the Kingdom, <hi>Orleans</hi> gaped after the Soveraignty, or at leaſt to have a ſhare in the Regency. And the others, either thought to revenge themſelves of the Favourite, or to procure themſelves advantages. But becauſe the malecontents did believe, that the perſon alone of the Cardinal was to oppoſe their deſigns, they reſolved to kill him, and that St. <hi>Mars</hi> ſhould execute it, not only as having the greateſt courage, but becauſe he paſſed through the Guards with leſs obſervations and greater confidence. And he in the Journey might have performed it at <hi>Briara</hi> near <hi>Lyons,</hi> for that he found him there not well guarded; but abſtained from it, either deſiring, that in ſo great a change of things <hi>Orleans</hi> ſhould be in Court, or at leaſt judging with deſigns perhaps more vaſt, that the Cardinal being ſo ſoon taken away, further attempts would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main languiſhing and diſcredited, which had their principal ſupport from the hatred conceived againſt him.</p>
               <p>The Cardinal having gotten notice of their deſigns, the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived at <hi>Perpignan,</hi> ſtaid, as hath been ſaid, at <hi>Narbonne,</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving he might remain a far off with greater ſafety, and beſides, the vivacity of mind and the artifice of wit in caſes of the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity not abandoning him, he cauſed his deplorable condition of life to be publiſhed by his Attendants and the Chirurgions them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; to the end, that from ſuch hope the Conſpirators might ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from blemiſhing themſelves with the blood of him, of whom nature was within a while to be the more juſt Murtherer. The King falls grievouſly ſick in the Camp of a Dyſentery, and in the
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:53750:275"/>
contingency of his life aroſe in the Court and alſo in the Army great diviſions; ſome adhering to <hi>Meilleray,</hi> who ſupported the party of the Cardinal, others to <hi>Monſieur le Grand,</hi> who declared himſelf for <hi>Orleans. Lewis</hi>'s health in a ſhort ſpace recovered, quiets that ſtir; yet giving means to <hi>le Grand</hi> to the end to entertain the King in his averſion againſt the Miniſter, to draw arguments from what had happened of <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s exceſs of power and thoughts of the Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The Cardinal perceiving that he had no more ſupport in the Kings favour, and ſeeing rather, under the ſhadow of his connivence, the party of the malecontents increaſing, had thoughts of retiring from <hi>Narbonne,</hi> where he thought himſelf not ſafe; but before he would do it, ſupplicates the King, that he would come to ſee him, either to unlooſe him from the malecontents, or to awaken in him with Eloquence and Art his former thoughts of him. <hi>Lewis</hi> refuſing to do it, be then knew he was totally loſt, and therefore as faſt as he could, though in a bad ſeaſon, cauſes his Guards to carry him by hand in a certain Couch of Wood, where he repoſed upon a Bed, towards the Baths of <hi>Terraſcona,</hi> to go forwards afterwards into <hi>Dauphiné</hi> and <hi>Provenze,</hi> whither the Governours of thoſe Provinces, which were depending upon him, invited him. In this Conjuncture came the News, that <hi>Guiſche</hi> had been defeated on the Frontiers of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that <hi>Paris</hi> was in great apprehenſion. Many judged, that the Count being in a ſtrict intelligence with the Cardinal, had by an affected negligence been the cauſe of this ſiniſter accident, to the end, that in the confuſion of things the King might know, how neceſſary would be to him the Miniſter, in whom the intelligence of the Kingdom reſted. In effect, no other Expedient offered it ſelf to <hi>Lewis</hi> but to ſend a Courrier after the Cardinal, requiring him, that to ſo ſudden an emergency he would apply ſeaſonable reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; for the better ordering whereof he deſired in ſome place to ſpeak with him. But as the ſame Fortune, in oppoſition to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, contributed to the proſperity of the Cardinal, ſo did he heap much greater advantage from the accident; for continuing his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, very uncertain what meaſures to take, the Treaty of <hi>Orleans,</hi> made with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> came to his hands. He preſently ſends it to the King, to the end that he might know that whatſoever wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the authority and favour of the Miniſter, did withal ſtrike through his own felicity and the Grandeur of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> was as much moved as the relapſe of his Brother, the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of <hi>le Grand,</hi> and the perfidy of others deſerved; wherefore changing his affections into anger, he goes to <hi>Narbonne,</hi> and there, to the end the Arreſt might be done out of the Camp and with leſs noiſe, he cauſed St. <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>de Thou</hi> to be put Priſoners, ordering ſecretly in <hi>Italy,</hi> whither <hi>Bouillon</hi> was gone to command the Army, that the ſame ſhould be done with him. He then goes to <hi>Tarraſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> where the Cardinal ſtaid, and there ſpeaking together, they vented even with tears their affections and paſt diſguſts. The King communicates all that to the Cardinal, which they had ſuggeſted againſt him, and this confirmed the King in the opinion, that in his
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:53750:275"/>
fidelity and power conſiſted the greateſt defence againſt foreign Forces and domeſtick Treacheries. Thus the Mine being ſprung into the Air, <hi>Orleans</hi> aſked the Kings pardon, who grants it him, on condition to ſee him no more, and that with an aſſignment of two hundred thouſand Francs he would retire to <hi>Niſſi,</hi> a Town upon the Confines of <hi>Savoy. Melo,</hi> the hope vaniſhing of raiſing ſo great a ſtorm in <hi>France,</hi> draws near to <hi>Sedan</hi> to perſwade at leaſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Wife of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> who was now a Priſoner in <hi>Italy</hi> at <hi>Caſal,</hi> to admit into the place a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon. But he obtained it not, becauſe thoſe Princeſſes conſidered the preſervation of it, the beſt caution they had of the Dukes life. Making then an Incurſion into the Territory of <hi>Bologne</hi> with the taking of certain Forts, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retaken by <hi>Harcourt,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ended the Campagnia on the ſide of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The minds of the King and his Miniſter being reconciled, and by that concord the Forces alſo of the Army ſtrengthened before <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan,</hi> by the concourſe of much Gentry from the neighbouring Provinces, the <hi>French</hi> prepared themſelves to reſiſt the more reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute attempts, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> gave out they would hazard. The Naval Army of <hi>Spain,</hi> under the Command of the Prince <hi>John Carlo di Medici,</hi> General of the Sea, was to ſecond by Water the Relief which the Marqueſs <hi>di Torrecuſo</hi> was to attempt by Land. But retarding his march too too long, <hi>Perpignan,</hi> the Victuals after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral months ſiege being ſpent and the Garriſon waſted, was at laſt rendred to the Mareſhals <hi>Schomberg</hi> and <hi>la Meilleray,</hi> whilſt the King, weakly in his health, was at ſome diſtance from the Camp. The loſs of this place was of importance to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and moſt afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Conde</hi> Duke, who, to hinder it, had without effect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Treaſures, Treaties, and Arts infinite. The doubt more particularly tormented him, leſt while the happineſs of ſucceſſes maintained <hi>Richelieu</hi> amidſt ſo many contrarieties, his ill Fortune ſhould at laſt weary the Kings affection towards him. And the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was, that he came into the Kings Cabinet lamenting and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and falling upon his knees, with tears demanded leave to expoſe himſelf to ſome certain danger, to kill himſelf, or at leaſt to retire into the moſt obſcure corner of the World, to deliver himſelf from that unhappy Deſtiny which purſued him, and that the King aſking with apprehenſion the cauſe, and underſtanding it to be the loſs of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> did embrace and comfort him, aſcribing all to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Divine Will. After <hi>Perpignan, Salſes</hi> was alſo taken, and at laſt out of time the Army appears commanded by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Leganes,</hi> which conſiſted of twenty thouſand Foot and ſix thouſand Horſe; but coming to a Battel with the <hi>French,</hi> that were inferiour in number, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> at firſt prevailed, but at laſt, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouſly buſying themſelves in drawing off three Cannon, gained in the firſt ſhock, <hi>la Mothe Haudancourt</hi> rallying his men, charges the Vanguard and diſorders it. Night thereupon coming on, both Armies retired, each aſcribing to it ſelf the Victory. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having poſſeſſed <hi>Aitona,</hi> a weak place, and more weakly defended,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:53750:276"/>
were quickly waſted through ſcarcity of Victuals, which were to be brought from far and with exceſſive charge.</p>

                  <hi>Richelieu</hi> triumphed over his inteſtine no leſs than foreign Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for <hi>Perpignan</hi> rendred, St. <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> had their heads cut off at <hi>Lyons;</hi> and <hi>Bouillon,</hi> threatned with the ſame puniſhment, ranſoms himſelf with the delivery of <hi>Sedan</hi> to the King, to which Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> betwixt the terrours of death and the hopes of great recompence, perſwaded him. In theſe diſtractions was highly advantagious to <hi>Richelieu</hi> the common deſire of the Confederates of <hi>France</hi> to maintain him; for having ſome of them his Penſioners, and in a manner all depending on him, they imployed their offices with the King; and <hi>Orange</hi> in particular, little leſs than with proteſts, gave him to underſtand, that in the belief of the Cardinals ruine, he, contrary to his former inclinations, had counſelled the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to hearken to a Truce with <hi>Spain,</hi> fearing, leſt Maxims being changed with the change of Government, there might be a change alſo with new Favourites in the faith of the Crown towards its Confederates.</p>
               <p>At this time the Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Wife, Mother-in-law, and Mother of the greateſt Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> wandring without ſhelter or refuge, as a ſpectacle of humane miſery, dyes at <hi>Collen</hi> in a poor and hired houſe, driven by the Parliament from <hi>London,</hi> rejected by the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> and forſaken by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This accident alſo was by the Cardinal, as a deſpiſer of Fame, numbred amongſt his felicities, riſen, to ſay truth, in the eye of the World to the higheſt point, but in himſelf contaminated by unquietneſs of mind and infirmities of body. He had diſcovered many of the Kings Guards participants in the contrivances of St. <hi>Mars,</hi> and in particular <hi>Monſieur de Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> Captain of the Muſquetiers. For the laſt proof of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and of the Kings patience, he deſires that he would diſcharge him, and moreover that he would come out of St. <hi>Germans</hi> to ſpeak with him, and give way, that his Guards might mingle with the Kings for his greater ſecurity. The King was truly troubled at it, as loving <hi>Treville,</hi> and comprehending how inſolent the demand was, yet after certain days reluctancy, the Cardinal otherwiſe proteſting he would retire, he complies with him, out of a belief, that the War, promoted by his ambition, and the affairs imbroiled by his Arts, could not be ſupported and diſ-intangled but by his abilities.</p>
               <p>But when the Cardinal thought himſelf in a manner delivered from the changeableneſs of Fortune, Nature would exerciſe her rights; for waſted with many diſeaſes, death took him away upon the 4. of <hi>December</hi> in the fifty eighth year of his age. <hi>Armand,</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal and Duke of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> of noble but ordinary Parents, and, as it happens, that the beginnings of our lives, buried in the deepeſt darkneſs, give no diſcerning, whither the Laws of Deſtiny will be extended, he applies himſelf in his Youth to Studies, and afterwards to the life of a Church-man. Aſpiring always to the greateſt things, he made it viſible, that from every corner of Fortune the higheſt degrees are to be attained to, provided a man have the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:53750:276"/>
to promote and believe himſelf worthy of them. Inſinuating himſelf into the Court, he intrudes himſelf into the Factions, and ſucceeds, either in ſowing diſcords, or compoſing them ſo excellent, that Art never failed him, and was ſeldom abandoned by Fortune. If he introduced himſelf into favour, if he enjoyed it, it was always againſt the inclination of the Prince that raiſed him. He ſets the King at enmity with his Mother, with his Brother, and, it may be ſaid, with his own ſelf, conſtraining him to give up his Authority to him, though he denied him his affection. He ballanced favour againſt envy, ſupported by the King, but always hated by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, execrated by the people, and ſought to be intrapped by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. He never grew remiſs in proſperity, nor deſpaired in the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of affairs, in which either chance furniſhed him with accidents, or his wit ſuggeſted counſels. Having diſarmed the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> laid low the Great Ones, weakned the people and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, he eſtabliſhed the vigour of the Kingly Government. On the other ſide, uſurping all power to himſelf, fearing the ſecurity of Peace, and thinking himſelf more ſecure amidſt the revolutions of Arms, he was the Author of Wars and of long and grievous calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with ſo much ſhedding of blood and tears within and without the Kingdom, that it is no wonder, that many have publiſhed him for a man fallacious in his word, cruel in his hatred, and inflexible in revenge. But certainly, leaving to God the more exact judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his intentions and deeds, thoſe gifts cannot be denied him, which the World is accuſtomed to attribute to great Perſonages, his Enemies agreeing in a confeſſion with his Friends, that he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed ſuch and ſo many, that whitherſoever he had directed affairs, he had reaped ſucceſs and power. This may be ſaid, that having united <hi>France,</hi> ſuccoured <hi>Italy,</hi> confounded the Empire, divided <hi>England,</hi> and weakned <hi>Spain,</hi> he was the Inſtrument, choſen by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, for the ruine of <hi>Europe.</hi> The King, honouring his death with tears, and his memory with praiſes, fluctuated amidſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thoughts in the choice of another Miniſter, doubting, leſt after one ſo great and ſo accredited every one elſe would be deſpiſed by his Subjects, and not eſteemed by the Princes his Friends. Yet he now taſted the liberty of Government without the ſhadow of a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom Favourite. But being rather accuſtomed to leave executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to others, than to ſet forth his own counſels, he proved timid and irreſolute. <hi>Richelieu,</hi> diſpoſing alſo as he was dying of the Kings Will, had left <hi>Mazarine</hi> Heir to the Poſt he poſſeſſed, beſeeching the King to eſtabliſh him in it, and to maintain him for the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Service of the Crown; whilſt inſtructed by him in the Affairs, Intereſts, and Deſigns, he had in all found him of ſo excellent an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, that he ſeemed born for that alone, in which he had, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to occurrences, been variouſly imployed.</p>
               <p>The King, perſwaded by his Wife, inclined not to leave the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of things to a Confident of the deceaſed, by reaſon of the hatred which he ſaw univerſally of his name. Many others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſpired to the favour, and thereto imployed the Arts of Court,

His Anceſtors being of <hi>Sicily,</hi> he was born at <hi>Rome,</hi> with noble but ſlender beginnings of Fortune: but ſcorning his firſt foundation, from the Militia, in which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Company of Foot in the <hi>Valteline,</hi> paſſing to the Treaty of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> from that to Prelacy, and the Nuntiature of <hi>France,</hi> and from thence to the ſtrict confidence of that Crown, by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination thereof to the Cardinalat he ſeemed arrived whither not ſo much as his own hopes had pointed him out the way. Seeing <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> falling at <hi>Perpignan,</hi> he thought of withdrawing from the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtroak, and got himſelf to be ſent into <hi>Italy,</hi> under pretext to adjuſt the differences of <hi>Parma</hi> with the Pope; but the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting him, as diſtruſted by him, or for old diſtaſts, by reaſon of the dependency which <hi>Mazarine</hi> had upon the Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> this hinderance ſerved as a rebound to his Fortune; for by <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>'s ſurmounting the ſnares laid for him, continuing at the Court, he was alſo in a capacity to ſucceed him in his ſtation. He though a ſtranger, and without ſupport, nay rather with the hatred, which from the very aſhes of <hi>Richelieu</hi> roſe up againſt thoſe which had been his Confidents, knew how to exerciſe a precarious authority. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore governed himſelf in ſuch ſort, that leaving to <hi>Lewis</hi> the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Government, and eaſing him of the burden, he ſeemed rather a Miniſter, than director of the Royal intentions.

               <p>His firſt care was to aſſure the Confederates of the Crown, that there ſhould be no change of a conſtant continuance in their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and with the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> he affects to beget a greater confidence, as one that born under the ſame Climate, and verſed in the Affairs of that Country, had a better inclination towards it; and therefore ſhews himſelf ſollicitous to procure a Peace betwixt the Pope and the Prince of <hi>Parma.</hi> But at the inſtant that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet upon the Mediation with earneſt, it hapned, that the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador <hi>Fontenay</hi> with <hi>Lionne</hi> were retired from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> The cauſe ſeemed not great; for, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> having depoſed from the Generalat of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> the Father <hi>Ridolfi,</hi> upon a Schiſm raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Convocation of that Religion held in <hi>Genua,</hi> the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> thereupon, ſaving <hi>Rodolfi</hi> his rights, had choſen <hi>Rocca Mora,</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> with the <hi>Italians, Mazarini,</hi> Brother to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:53750:277"/>
the Pope having made void that Convocation that they might proceed to a new Election, the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> pretended, that that was againſt the promiſe made him to promote <hi>Mazarini,</hi> and leaves the Court. The pretext ſeeming too ſlight, though he aimed chiefly to gain the good graces of the new Favourite, he added other diſguſts, and amongſt them, that the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour was not admitted, and the Mediation of the King had been ſlighted in the fraudulencies of the Treaties with the Duke of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> But the Court at <hi>Paris</hi> ill reſented, that he had ingaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo far, the Cardinal abhorring, that, under the cover of the Kings favour, his private intereſts ſhould ſo ſoon appear to the world: He therefore orders the matter ſo, that the Ambaſſadour with ſome appearance of ſatisfaction ſhould return to <hi>Rome;</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> were in the Kings name deſired to interpoſe, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their ſo ſlender confidence with the Pope in the preſent Affairs. They nevertheleſs employed their offices, but the buſineſs was quickly ſilenced; for the charge of Maſter of the holy Palace being conferred on the Father <hi>Mazarini,</hi> and he flattered with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hopes, eaſily let fall his pretenſions to the Generalat. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador now come to Court again, employs himſelf with greater warmth than formerly in the agreement of <hi>Parma.</hi> But all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect, becauſe the Cardinal <hi>Barberino</hi> put more confidence in Tricks than Treaties, and therefore, ſending the Abbot <hi>de Bagni</hi> to <hi>Florence,</hi> propoſed to the Grand Duke, <hi>That to</hi> Edward <hi>ſhould be given the abſolution of the cenſures, with the forms contained in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial; that to his eldeſt Son the inveſtiture of his Dominions ſhould be granted, with the reſtitution of all that was poſſeſſed, except</hi> Caſtro, Montalto, <hi>and ſo much Country round about, as a Cannon-ſhot could reach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe propoſitions, handed by the Grand Duke to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> were by common advice rejected, they ſeeming not admittable by the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and little honourable to the League, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves Protectors of that Intereſt. For this cauſe the Treaties were confirmed more cloſely in <hi>Venice,</hi> whither were come the Cavalier <hi>Giovanni Battiſta Gondi,</hi> the Grand Dukes chief Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, in the place of <hi>Pandolfini,</hi> who was ſick; and the Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena,</hi> to recommend to the Senate, beſides the publick, his own private intereſts alſo. He had a great deſire, that his pretenſions with the Pope might be comprehended in the League; but they, importing many and weighty difficulties, could not but too much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb <hi>Italy,</hi> beſides that every one of the Confederates would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon have reaſon to produce their own, that were of no leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was therefore reſolved, that they ſhould not abandon their firſt ends, of protecting the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> procuring Peace, and alſo ſhewing reſentment of the contempt in the late Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>But in the interim of theſe Negotiations, Duke <hi>Edward,</hi> put forward by the fury and fervour of his Genius, ſends under the Marqueſſes <hi>Sciabuf,</hi> and <hi>Edward Scott,</hi> about three thouſand Foot,
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:53750:278"/>
croſs the <hi>Appennines</hi> through the <hi>Lunigiana</hi> to be imbarked, where the <hi>Magra</hi> falls into the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> upon certain <hi>Tartanes,</hi> haſtily got together, in hope, that landing upon the ſhore, and eaſily taking the weak Rock of <hi>Montalto,</hi> they might ſpeed alſo in poſſeſſing themſelves of <hi>Caſtro</hi> in the ſudden aſtoniſhment of the ſurpriſe. To ſecond the deſign, and divert the Enemies Forces, he with fifteen hundred Horſe intended, as formerly, to enter into the <hi>Bologneſe.</hi> The cold of the Winter, and the difficulty to paſs over the Snow, retards ſo long the march of the Foot, that advice of it came to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo that they had time to prepare for the defence, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the place. But the Dukes Souldiers came not there at all; for being ſcarce imbarked, and the <hi>Tartanes</hi> put from the ſhore, ſo fierce a ſtorm encounters them, that being driven to <hi>Genoua</hi> and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fino,</hi> they were forced to caſt Anchor and ſave themſelves there. Victuals wanting, that were but ſcantily provided, and money, part of the men periſhed, and the reſt diſbanding were received into pay by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, who ſeaſonably ſent them to ſtrengthen the Governour of <hi>Milan,</hi> who beſieged <hi>Tortona.</hi> Upon this accident the <hi>Barberins</hi> publiſhed, that it was evident, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune from Heaven had fought upon the Sea in favour of their cauſe. Seeming afterwards to doubt, that the Duke, rather irritated than wearied by ill ſucceſs, deſigned to poſſeſs that part of the <hi>Ferrareſe,</hi> which beyond the <hi>Po</hi> confines with the Republick, the Cardinal <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio</hi> talked of laying a great Fort at <hi>Lago Scuro,</hi> to paſs a Bridge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the River, and draw a Chain croſs it, which was there ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Banks, with all preparations to fortifie himſelf on this ſide the <hi>Po,</hi> and ſend men thither. If the <hi>Venetians</hi> had in the beginning been troubled, when by the <hi>Barberins</hi> certain Guards had been ſent thither, and a certain Fort traced, that, to avoid at that time jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, proceedings were diſcontinued; they were at preſent ſo much the more moved, as they ſaw the deſign to ſhut up the River to others, and facilitate paſſage for their own Army, which paſſing to this ſide of the River might ravage as far as to the <hi>Adice,</hi> poſſeſs or at leaſt lay waſte the <hi>Poleſene,</hi> and drown it at their pleaſure. They therefore gave it to be underſtood, that they were not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the novelty and violation of ſo ancient agreements, and ordered <hi>Giovanni Peſari,</hi> Cavalier and Procurator, ſucceeded into the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralat <hi>di Terra firma</hi> to <hi>Luigi Giorgio</hi> deceaſed, that with powerful Forces he ſhould go into the <hi>Poleſene</hi> to ſave harmleſs their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and to hinder the building of the Bridge, or deſtroy it if he found it built. He marching immediately thither with ſix thouſand five hundred Foot and a great number of Horſe, was the cauſe, that the Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> ſuſpended putting it in effect.</p>
               <p>Minds being in this manner irritated, they netled one another on all occaſions. In <hi>Sacca di Goro,</hi> a <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Veſſel loaded with Corn for <hi>Ferrara</hi> was by the Souldiers of armed Barks, who feigning to be Fiſhermen came in there, ſurpriſed and carried to <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Nuntio, demanding the releaſe of it, had for an anſwer, that the Senate was minded to exerciſe their Juriſdiction of the Sea. The
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:53750:278"/>
Lading confiſcate, the Veſſel at the intreaties of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> was reſtored to the owners. Another Veſſel alſo was taken away by a Galley from under the Tower of <hi>Magnavacca.</hi> But notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all tended to a rupture, the Confederates diſapproved the frequent attempts of the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> becauſe, not able to go forth to any purpoſe, by reaſon of the fewneſs of his Forces, his unhappy ſucceſs equally diminiſhed the vigour and reputation of his Arms. He nevertheleſs, always reſtleſs and impatient, demanded paſſage through <hi>Tuſcany</hi> to go with fifteen hundred Horſe and a few Foot to the recovery of <hi>Caſtro.</hi> The Great Duke denies it ſo long, till having ſetled ſome concerts at <hi>Venice,</hi> it might be reſolved upon a better ground. But to repel any licence that might be taken, he ſends men to keep the Paſſes, while on the other ſide the Prince <hi>Matthias</hi> with ſeven thouſand men guarded the Borders, which the Eccleſiaſticks kept in Arms, by reaſon of the ſo frequent reports of Duke <hi>Edwards</hi> motion. He knowing, that the Confederates incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to declare themſelves more openly in his favour, whilſt at <hi>Rome Savelli, Caſanate,</hi> and <hi>Fontenay,</hi> in the Name of the Crowns, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in interpoſing offices, had more clearly underſtood, that the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro</hi> would not be effected by Treaty, ſends to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> the Count <hi>Ferdinando Scotto</hi> not to participate in the Meetings, but to obſerve the Negotiations and Reſolutions. But being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to enter into the League, as he refuſed it not, not to diſguſt the Princes Contractors, ſo deſiring to ingage them and keep himſelf free, caſts in ſeveral difficulties, particularly concerning the Command of the Army, which, though in their Countries, he pretended to by turns with the Grand Duke and the Duke of <hi>Modena.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This gave no ſtop to the Negotiation of the Deputies, who agreed in all the points, except that, which the <hi>Florentines</hi> propoſed, to form two Armies, the one in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Modoneſe,</hi> to be imployed in ſeveral parts, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> diſſented from ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Forces at ſo great a diſtance, doubting, leſt the <hi>Barberins</hi> ſhould make a diverſion in the <hi>Poleſene,</hi> but propoſed to poſſeſs with their own Forces, at the firſt motion of the Army, the Banks of the <hi>Po,</hi> to ſecure the paſſage over the River, cover their own Country, and, facilitating the conjunction of the Armies, open a way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce betwixt the Confederates. On the other ſide the Grand Duke knowing the convenience and the profit of it, doubted to remain himſelf in that interim expoſed to dangers; and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, that above all the body of an Army might be formed in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> with his own Forces, with thoſe of the Republick, which were in the <hi>Modoneſe,</hi> and with other three thouſand Foot and a thouſand Horſe, to be divided betwixt the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> and the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick it ſelf. But by this means the <hi>Modoneſe</hi> was left unprovided, into which if the Pontificians ſhould enter, they not only quelled that Duke in a few days, but ſeparating the others Countries, the deſigns and concerts remained wholly in diſorder. This point was debated for ſeveral weeks, to the great advantage of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> to arm themſelves powerfully, and ſend Souldiers to <hi>Ferrara</hi> and
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:53750:279"/>
                  <hi>Bologna.</hi> But the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> with a mind greater than his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reviving the War, when it ſeemed moſt ſuppreſſed, cuts ſhort the tediouſneſs of conſultations, letting the Confederates know, that, neceſſity being now in him converted into reaſon, not being able to maintain his Troops any longer, he was forced to lead them into the Enemies Country.</p>
               <p>The communication went along with the effect, for he was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on his march alongſt the <hi>Po,</hi> demanding of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> paſſage through his Country, at the inſtant that he was ready to take it. He had with him ſix weak Regiments of Foot of ſeveral Nations, and as many of Horſe, with one of Dragoons and eight pieces of Artillery; but to the end they might not hinder his march, leaving them with the Foot, which might follow with leſs haſte, he enters into the <hi>Ferrareſe,</hi> and comes to <hi>Bondeno,</hi> which lies upon the right hand Chanel of that Branch of the <hi>Po,</hi> which is called <hi>di Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> where the <hi>Panaro</hi> with other Water-courſes enters into it, and had been fortified by the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> to ſhut the paſſage betwixt the <hi>Modeneſe</hi> and the River. <hi>Franciſco Murriconi,</hi> a <hi>Neopolitan,</hi> who with five hundred Foot and four hundred Horſe had the keeping of it, though perſwaded by <hi>Valanzé</hi> with the hopes of ſpeedy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to reſiſt, no ſooner heard a Volley of the Dukes men, come in the duskineſs of the evening near the Fort, but he runs away, followed by the Garriſon, into <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where afterwards he loſt his head. The <hi>Parmeſians</hi> then poſſeſſing it without blood, not to give time for relief they attacque <hi>la Stellata,</hi> which, though better defended, for the ſtraitneſs of the place, was nevertheleſs in a very ſhort time taken. Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> to hinder the Dukes further progreſs, and obſerve what the League might be able to undertake, immediately incamps at <hi>Hoſteria Nuova,</hi> a convenient place betwixt <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Bologna.</hi> The Confederates, underſtanding the Duke was marched, knew it was fit without making more difficulty to come to a concluſion, while it was better to do it, the Armies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in motion, before that either the people ſhould ſhake off that ſudden fright, or the Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> aſſembling his Forces, ſhould defeat or make the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> retire. A new Treaty was therefore on the twenty ſixth of <hi>May</hi> ſubſcribed by thoſe Miniſters and Deputies, which had alſo negotiated the other in <hi>Venice,</hi> in which, adhering fully to that of the year paſt, it was agreed; <hi>To increaſe the Forces to eighteen thouſand Foot, and two thouſand ſix hundred Horſe, or to ſuch a greater number as the occaſions ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Two bodies of Armies were conſented to be formed; the one in</hi> Tuſcany, <hi>conſiſting of the Troops, to which the Grand Duke was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, with a thouſand Horſe and two thouſand Foot more, if they were Strangers, or three thouſand of another Nation, which the Confederates were to ſend to them. The other was to be aſſembled in the</hi> Modeneſe; <hi>and in both, the Colours of the League was to be carried ſpread. In each, for the directing of the undertakings, a conſultation was reſolved on by vote of the Confederates, of whom the plurality was to take place. What ſhould be taken was to be held in the name of all, till the Duke of</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:53750:279"/>
                  <hi>ſhould be reſtored to what was his. Place therefore was left for him in the Treaty, to come in with his Forces proportionably to the Armies of</hi> Tuſcany <hi>and the</hi> Modeneſe. <hi>In this 'twas granted him, if he were preſent, to command by turns with that Duke, and he was obliged to contribute three thouſand Foot and four hundred and fifty Horſe, when any of the Confederates ſhould be invaded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the motion of the Army, it was agreed, <hi>That the</hi> Venetians <hi>ſhould ſeize upon the banks of the</hi> Po <hi>and when there was occaſion of taking the field, the Troops in the</hi> Modoneſe <hi>with thoſe of</hi> Parma <hi>alſo, if they could join, ſhould at the ſame time ſecond the enterpriſe. The</hi> Venetians <hi>then ſending the Army to the other ſide of the River, the two bodies ſhould be formed, and the number agreed on ſent into</hi> Tuſcany, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that the conſult of the</hi> Modeneſe <hi>ſhould have power to hinder it. The Miniſters were to be recalled from</hi> Rome; <hi>from</hi> Venice <hi>and</hi> Florence <hi>the Nuncios to be diſcharged, the Revenues of the</hi> Barberins <hi>to be ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, and concerning the true intention of the League inclining only to Peace, and the repairing the Duke of</hi> Parma, <hi>participation was to be given to the Princes, to clear the jealouſies, which it was known were ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted particularly to the two Crowns by the</hi> Barberins.</p>
               <p>Theſe were the good diſpoſitions of the League; but the good order to execute them was by various accidents interrupted: For, though great union and conſtancy appeared in the Princes, yet their Countries and Forces being divided, much time was oftentimes loſt in communicating counſels, and concerting reſolutions. It hapned, that at this inſtant the <hi>Po</hi> being extraordinarily riſen, the <hi>Venetians</hi> feared, leſt Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> ſhould cut the Banks, to lay the <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſene</hi> under water, and hinder the movings of the Armies, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a vaſt intrenchment of Water: They therefore command the General, that he ſhould ſpeedily repare thither, though in the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneſe</hi> they were not yet ready to march.</p>
               <p>That diſtrict of Country which belongs to <hi>Ferrara</hi> conſiſts in two ſtreaks, more long than large. The greater, of which the chief Town is <hi>Trecenta,</hi> runs from the Confines of the <hi>Mantuan</hi> to <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſella,</hi> where for a little way the Country of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> facing to the River, cuts off the other, which beſides <hi>Criſpino</hi> hath few other Towns, and paſſes from <hi>Poleſella</hi> to the borders of <hi>Adria,</hi> wholly belonging to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Into the firſt, there being ſome Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Garriſon, <hi>Peſari</hi> ſends three bodies of men; the one to <hi>Melara,</hi> commanded by <hi>Carruccio</hi> Colonel of the Nations <hi>Croatte</hi> and <hi>Albaneſe;</hi> another to <hi>Figarolo,</hi> that was more numerous, by <hi>la Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letta;</hi> the third to <hi>Lago Scuro,</hi> by the Count <hi>Giovanni Battiſta Porto.</hi> The Poſts were every where poſſeſſed with eaſe, and into the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part, abandoned by the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> it ſufficed to ſend ſome to take poſſeſſion of it. <hi>Peſari</hi> makes his head quarter at <hi>Trecenta,</hi> and orders that the Fortifications of <hi>Lago Scuro</hi> and <hi>Melara</hi> ſhould be bettered, and in particular a good Fort planted at <hi>Figarolo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the gaining of all this, the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> had alſo aſpired, becauſe, being over againſt <hi>Stellata,</hi> he had intended to inlarge Contributions and Quarters for his men. Some of his Troops in
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:53750:280"/>
Barques were juſt arrived near the ſhoar, but found they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by thoſe of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> not without ſome diſpleaſure to the Duke, who afterwards informed of the reaſon, was eaſily paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. In purſuance of the foreſaid ſeizure, there came alſo out of the <hi>Modeneſe,</hi> taking poſt at the <hi>Red Church,</hi> the Troops of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, with ſome few of the Dukes; for, the <hi>Florentines</hi> conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Agreement which the Treaty conſented, were by the Grand Duke recalled into <hi>Tuſcany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> now ſent to the other ſide of the <hi>Po</hi> other ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and a thouſand Horſe, to fulfil their obligation, though <hi>Peſari,</hi> that conſidered the new Conqueſts on the Banks remained more weak and expoſed to accidents, unwillingly condeſcended, but conſtrained to it by re-iterated orders, ſent them at twice, firſt the half under <hi>la Valetta.</hi> and the reſt afterwards with <hi>Camillo Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga,</hi> one of the Princes of <hi>Buzzolo,</hi> entred lately into the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks pay with the charge of General of the Artillery.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> had removed his Camp to <hi>Cento,</hi> and the place lying at the head of the <hi>Modeneſe,</hi> ſo fortified himſelf there, that he equally defended the Territories of <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Bologna.</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates to make ſome advance deſired to diſlodge him, and <hi>la Valetta</hi> with ſeven Companies of Horſe and four hundred Muſke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers was ſent to view the Poſt; but, by the Guides fault, arriving late, and being diſcovered, he nevertheleſs attacques a Guard ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. <hi>Matthei,</hi> to ſupport them, comes forth with a body of Horſe, and the skirmiſh grew ſo hot, that, the <hi>Pontificians</hi> being more in number, <hi>la Valetta</hi> retires, under the favour of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other men, and the Muſquetiers placed in good order longſt the Hedges and Ditches. The Cardinals quarter diſcovered by this faction to be ſtronger and better fortified than was ſuppoſed, the conſults and minds of the Confederates were very wavering; that which oppoſed the ſending the concerted Troops into <hi>Tuſcany</hi> and making further attempts, being the diſturbance which roſe from the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> becauſe, the Princes having taken for granted, that he would not recede from that Union which had been concluded for his protection and aſſiſtance, had in the diviſion made ſtate of his Forces, in that number that himſelf had offered, that is to ſay, one thouſand four hundred Horſe, ſix hundred Dragoons, and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Foot. They therefore ſollicited him to underwrite the League, or at leaſt to contribute to the undertaking his perſon and his Army. He with ſundry excuſes, either to fortifie the Poſts poſſeſſed, or to recruit his Troops, and by demanding, that the League would abſolutely oblige it ſelf to the recovery of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> kept off; for, deeming to have obtained his intent by the taking of thoſe Poſts, which, by reaſon of the neceſſity of the paſſage of the <hi>Po,</hi> the Confederates were bound to maintain, he had no further care, and having ſo much in his power as was ſufficient to make <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtro</hi> be reſtored to him, he judged it beſt to keep himſelf free.</p>
               <p>The Troops then in the <hi>Modeneſe</hi> from the very beginning began to languiſh betwixt delays and diſguſts. The <hi>Venetians</hi> employed
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:53750:280"/>
one part of their Forces at Sea, infeſting the Coaſt with ſix Gallies and with armed Barks even to <hi>Ancona,</hi> and interrupting Commerce. They took alſo after ſome ſhot of Cannon the Tower of <hi>Premiero,</hi> which, a while after recovered by the Pontificians, was demoliſhed, and they landed at <hi>Ceſenatico,</hi> where were in Garriſon two hundred forty Foot with forty Horſe, and the place being taken by force, was laid in aſhes by a fire which was kindled in the fight.</p>
               <p>There was alſo taken near <hi>Premiero</hi> and demoliſhed a little Fort, the Eccleſiaſticks having made another more inward, and upon the Confines of <hi>Loreo, Niccolo Delfino,</hi> Proveditor, ſurpriſed in the night by Scalade that which, called <hi>delle Bocchette,</hi> the Eccleſiſticks had in former times built there. The Towers of <hi>del Abbate</hi> and <hi>di Goro</hi> were rendred by threatning the Garriſon with the Gallows, if they ſhould dare to expect the Cannon. <hi>Arriano,</hi> a great Town, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to have been defended, becauſe there was no acceſs but by two Dikes only, being in a fright, driving out the Garriſon of their own accord, yielded to <hi>Delfino</hi> himſelf. He now roves to and fro on the other ſide of the <hi>Po,</hi> and ſpoiling the Country, routs two Companies of Horſe which were quartered at <hi>Cologna.</hi> They then aſſaulted <hi>Codegoro,</hi> where were aſſembled ſix hundred Foot and two hundred Horſe, either to attempt the recovery of <hi>Arriano,</hi> or for ſome other deſign; and there the <hi>Albanian</hi> Souldiers, inraged at the ſight of the blood of ſome of their Officers that were hurt, entred with ſo great fury, that cutting to pieces without diſtinction almoſt all the Inhabitants and Souldiers, and ſetting fire to it, they ſavage-like burnt the place.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> obſerving the pauſe and demur of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates in invading the <hi>Ferrareſe,</hi> and thinking by carrying the War into the Country of <hi>Modena,</hi> to give their Army greater imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the defence of it, ſends from the ſide of <hi>Caſtel Franco, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thei</hi> with a thouſand Foot and as many Horſe, who took in <hi>Spilim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto, Vignivola,</hi> and St. <hi>Ceſareo,</hi> open places of that Frontier; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to go further in towards <hi>Saſſuolo</hi> and into <hi>Montagna.</hi> The Duke with the Proveditor <hi>Corraro</hi> and with all the Army follow him, Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> coaſting upon it not far off.</p>
               <p>The Confederates deſired to draw him to a Battel; for though their number were not greater, ſurely the Diſcipline of their Troops was more veteran and experienced. They reſolved to inveſt under his eye <hi>Crevalcuore,</hi> a good Town of the <hi>Ferrareſe,</hi> but not ſtrong at all, and ſent thither to attempt it <hi>la Valette</hi> with a thouſand Foot and four hundred Horſe, who dividing the Foot into three Troops, thought to take it at one aſſault. But finding the Ditch large and full of water, he cauſes to be brought two ſmall pieces of Cannon to make a breach, which gave time to Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> to bring ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours into it and attacque <hi>la Valette,</hi> who with a few Foot, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned by the Cuiraſſiers, was conſtrained to retire in diſorder, and leaving one of his Cannon ſticking in the miry ways. He had carefully ſollicited the whole Army, which was not far off, to move; but the Duke and the others of the Conſult, by reaſon of
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:53750:281"/>
this diſorder changing counſel, and conſidering of what importance it would be, if any misfortune happening, the <hi>Modeneſe</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in prey to the Enemy, ſtirred not. The Pontificians had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle loſs ſave one <hi>French</hi> Captain of Cuiraſſiers killed. The Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates loſs about two hundred men, and amongſt thoſe one Captain of Foot, and another was taken Priſoner. After this the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates purſuing their reſolution to march, obliged <hi>Matthei</hi> to go out of the <hi>Modeneſe,</hi> and abandon all the Poſts, except that of <hi>Spilim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto.</hi> They then alted for ſome days at <hi>Buon Porto,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> quarters at St. <hi>Giovanni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this interim the Grand Duke coming to St. <hi>Caſciano</hi> had put the Army into the field, under the Command of the Prince <hi>Matthias</hi> and the direction of <hi>Alexander del Borro,</hi> a valiant and experienced Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier. <hi>Barberino</hi> ſends againſt them betwixt <hi>Petigliano</hi> and <hi>Sorano</hi> a body of betwixt five and ſix thouſand men, commanded by the Duke <hi>Frederico Savelli,</hi> who, as a <hi>Roman</hi> Baron and Subject of the Church, being obliged to obey the Pope, was by the Emperour, at the inſtance of the Confederates, diſcharged from the Embaſſy, which in his Name he exerciſed in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that oppoſition, the <hi>Florentines</hi> advanced into the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Territory, and having taken the ſtrong Paſs of <hi>Buterone,</hi> attacqued the City <hi>della Pieve,</hi> where the Garriſon, though of fifteen hundred men, ſcarce ſtaying for the Cannon, went out with their Swords only. From thence <hi>Borri</hi> with eight hundred Horſe and two thouſand Foot made an Inroad as far as <hi>Orvieto,</hi> obliging <hi>Savel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi> to retire more into the Country. <hi>Monteleone</hi> then was rendred, and the Army was ſcarce come to <hi>Caſtigliano del Lago,</hi> but <hi>Fabio del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Corgna,</hi> who poſſeſſed it in Fief, overcome, as was ſaid, by the Great Duke with ſecret Treaties, gave it up without defence. He was therefore by ſentence and cenſure declared by the Pope a Rebel. The gaining of that drew along with it <hi>Paſſignano</hi> upon the ſame Lake. The Gallies alſo of the Grand Duke ſcoured the Coaſt of <hi>Romagna;</hi> but he now preſſed the Republick, that it would ſend him, for a greater Renfort to his Army, the men promiſed by the Treaty.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> ſhewed to have not only fulfilled what they were obliged to, by ſending beyond the <hi>Po</hi> all the men of their reperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the diſpoſition of the League; but alſo to have ſuperabounded by keeping for the common benefit the Banks of that River with their own Souldiers, and by diſtracting the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with another body of men upon the Confines of <hi>Loreo,</hi> and by obliging them with Barks and Gallies to the cuſtody of a long tract of Country; beſides that they were forced to furniſh to the Army of the <hi>Modoneſe</hi> Victuals, Carriages, and Cannon with their draught, and to garriſon <hi>Finale,</hi> a Town belonging to the <hi>Modoneſe,</hi> which ſituate amidſt the Waters of the <hi>Tanaro</hi> ſerved exceedingly for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the Poſts, kept by the <hi>Parmigians,</hi> and with the Country poſſeſſed on this ſide the <hi>Po.</hi> But in truth all diſorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe from the two Dukes, the one proving to be no help, and the
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:53750:281"/>
other ſerving for a burden; for that <hi>Edward</hi> ſtood within his ſtrength, idly looking how things went, and he of <hi>Modena,</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to defend his Borders, becauſe he had not in the field above a thouſand Foot and five hundred Horſe, kept the whole Army of the Confederates buſied in defending his Country; though the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, to diſ-ingage it, offered the pay of two thouſand Foot, if he could levy them of his own Subjects or Strangers.</p>
               <p>The Grand Duke thereupon was contented, that for the preſent four hundred Horſe ſhould be ſent to him for ſo long, till the three thouſand Foot, which after many contradictings and difficulties the Republick had in <hi>France</hi> obtained to be levied in <hi>Provenze,</hi> ſhould be diſ-imbarked at <hi>Ligorn</hi> to remain in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> whither the Senate ſends <hi>Bertuccio Valiero</hi> with Title of Proveditor to aſſiſt the Grand Duke at the Conſults and other occurrences.</p>
               <p>Amidſt theſe motions, or rather unquietneſs of Armies, treating was not given over by the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters; for that the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour <hi>d'Amo</hi> preſented a ſheet of Paper in <hi>Venice,</hi> which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Fontané</hi> had received in <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Barbarino,</hi> in which was contained; <hi>To reſtore the State of</hi> Caſtro <hi>to Duke</hi> Edward, <hi>the Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications being demoliſhed, and the Rights reſerved to the</hi> Montiſts, <hi>when the League, withdrawing their Arms, ſhould render what they had taken, and the Duke ſhould ask abſolution and pardon, the Pope offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ample Brief, ſecretly to be diſpatched to free him from preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices which he feared to incur, when by giving his conſent to the acts paſt and to the excommunication, he ſhould legitimate the crimes of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, which were laid to his charge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But no ſooner was this exhibited to the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, but <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barino</hi> ſollicites the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cardinals to propoſe to the Grand Duke a ſuſpenſion of Arms and the depoſiting <hi>Caſtro</hi> into his hand, with a Brief apart, which ſhould give him power to render it to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> when he ſhould perform thoſe humiliations which ſhould be agreed on. The Confederates, beſides diſpleaſure conceived at the late manner of proceeding in the Treaty, found many doubtful ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications and ſly evaſions to be contained in the preſent Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and, above all become jealous that Mediators and Propoſitions were ſo often changed, refuſed the ſuſpenſion of Arms, declaring notwithſtanding to the Ambaſſadours of both the Crowns their will to be moſt inclined to Peace, when it might be obtained upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that might render it laſting, honourable, and ſafe. The Count <hi>della Rocca,</hi> Ambaſſadour Extraordinary from <hi>Spain,</hi> being at this time arrived at <hi>Venice,</hi> and <hi>Giovanni d'Fraſſo</hi> at <hi>Florence,</hi> and they inſiſting upon things already rejected, obtained anſwers not differing. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cardinals thereupon at <hi>Rome</hi> hearkened to new Propoſitions of Union betwixt the Pope and King <hi>Philip,</hi> which the Cardinal <hi>Barberino</hi> ceaſed not to ſuggeſt, to give jealouſie to the Confederates; but the Republick in the name of all the League made ſo lively complaints of it at <hi>Madrid,</hi> with a proteſt, that the League on the other ſide would accept the invitations which <hi>France</hi> had ſo long made them to cloſe with that Crown, that the King im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:53750:282"/>
orders, that all ſuch practices ſhould be broken off. Nay the Vice-King of <hi>Naples,</hi> upon the Popes demand of nine hundred Horſe due for the inveſtiture of that Kingdom, in caſe the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick State ſhould be invaded, denys them; this not being the cauſe of the holy See, but of his Family and Kindred. And to ſay truth, the Crowns, by reaſon of the employments wherein they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, and much more for the condition of their domeſtick affairs, had little reaſon to intereſt themſelves but by mediation and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for in <hi>Spain,</hi> with the diſgrace of the Miniſter, and in <hi>France,</hi> with the death of the King, Government was changed.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> returned from <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> had in his heart ſomewhat cooled his affection towards the <hi>Condé</hi> Duke; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was, that by reaſon of continual diſgraces, the unhappy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of his Affairs was become troubleſom to him, or that he had perceived, things had been hitherto repreſented to him by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite in a proſpective differing from the truth. And now many from neceſſity ſaw themſelves bound, laying flattery and fear aſide, to ſpeak plain, but none durſt be the firſt, till the Queen, ſupported by the Emperour with Letters under his own hand to the King, and with the diſcourſe of the Marqueſs <hi>di Grana</hi> his Ambaſſador, reſolved to break through the vail and diſcover the ſecrets. All then took the Cue, and the very meaneſt perſons, either by notes in writing, or by word of mouth ſollicited the King to put away the Miniſter, and aſſume the Government to himſelf. He marvelling within himſelf, to have ignored till now the cauſes of this diſgrace, overcome with the light of ſo many advertiſements, which all at a time unvailed him, was wavering at firſt with himſelf, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the burden of the Government, and doubting leſt the wonted frauds of Court were practiſed againſt the Favourite; but at laſt not able to reſiſt the conſent of all, orders him one day on a ſudden to retire himſelf to <hi>Loeches. Olivares</hi> undaunted readily obeys, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſguiſed out of the Court, for fear of the people, who, if they are wont to follow Favourites whilſt they ſhine in the ſtation of favour and greatneſs, endeavour much more to tread them under foot, when they are precipitated by Fortune.</p>
               <p>This reſolution was applauded by all with exceſs of joy. The Grandees, formerly ſent away and oppreſſed, returned to ſerve the King, and render the Court more majeſtical; and the People offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtrifes men and money, animated by the report, that the King would take upon him the care of the Government hitherto neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But either fainting at the burden, or new to buſineſs, and with more new Miniſters, in the tediouſneſs of buſineſs, and the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of various accidents, he had fallen back inſenſibly into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer affection towards <hi>Olivares,</hi> if all the Court had not with an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous murmuring oppoſed it, nay if <hi>Olivares</hi> himſelf had not rather precipitated his hopes; for willing, by the publiſhing of certain Writings, to clear himſelf, he offended many in ſuch ſort, that the King thought it beſt to ſend him yet further off, and confine him to <hi>Toro.</hi> There, not accuſtomed to quiet, and afflicting himſelf, as
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:53750:282"/>
great wits are wont to do, he dyes within a while of grief. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but that he had great parts, of vivacity of wit, and application to buſineſs, but they were either corrupted by a raſh violence, which oftentimes in counſel carried him to extremities, or were fruſtrated by fortune, which always croſt his deſigns. He never ſuffered himſelf to be corrupted by Strangers, but it was imputed to him, that with flattery or not oppoſing he ſometimes betrayed the Kings ſervice. He poſſeſſed with great jealouſie the Kings favour and the power, which, to arrogate it to himſelf alone, he took from the Council and every body elſe. He employed few, and thoſe of his dependants; but he proved ſo unfortunate a Judge of abilities, that of all thoſe he employed, ſome wanting diligence, many capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and all approbation, he was very often for the faults and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of others condemned by the world. He always vainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his power; but he laid up no great riches, nor fortified his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate power againſt the publick authority with Places, Armies, and Governments. For this cauſe, if his Government was not applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his fall made no great noiſe, nor was his death conſidered. The King in truth, though he publiſhed the contrary, could not or would not govern by himſelf alone. Whereupon <hi>Luigi d' Haro,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, but withall an Enemy to <hi>Olivares,</hi> inſinuates himſelf by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, and, with great modeſty ſhewing his obedience to the King, in a ſhort time takes upon him the adminiſtration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>France,</hi> conformable to the nature of the people, the changes paſſed with a greater noiſe; for that <hi>Lewis,</hi> amidſt the cares of his mind, and the unquietneſs of his body, was fallen ſick even to extream languiſhing. By reaſon of the tender age of his Son, he was exerciſed in difficult thoughts, about the direction of affairs, and no leſs were troubled the principal Miniſters, the reliques of <hi>Richelieu's</hi> Faction fearing, leſt the Queen, coming to the authority of the Regency, ſhould for former diſguſts revenge her ſelf againſt them. <hi>Mazarine</hi> therefore, <hi>Bottiglier,</hi> Superintendent of the Finances, and his Son <hi>Chavigni,</hi> Secretary of State, being reduced to ſerious conſults about their Fortune, endeavoured to poſſeſs the King with the danger to which he expoſed the Crown and the Heir, if the Government ſhould fall to the Queen, not only new in Affairs, but offended by paſt uſage, and of a ſtrange Nation, nay an Enemy towards whom ſhe had not at all loſt inclination and affection. Nor did the counſel ſucceed ill; for <hi>Lewis</hi> by way of Teſtament orders the diſpoſition of the Government in the minority of the Son; <hi>Leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Wife the name of the Regency, but the power and effect to the Miniſters. To his Brother he commits the Lieutenancy of the Crown; To</hi> Condé <hi>the chief place in the Council, but ſubordinate to</hi> Orleans. <hi>He eſtabliſhed</hi> Mazarine <hi>in the Poſt of chief Miniſter; and for Counſellors added</hi> Sequier <hi>the great Chancellor, who was alſo of</hi> Richelieu's <hi>party,</hi> Bottillier, <hi>and</hi> Chavigni, <hi>with a caution that they ſhould not be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but for crime or by death. By this Council with plurality of Votes were to be decided the moſt weighty matters, charges military and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:53750:283"/>
diſpenſed, and when occaſion was, the Miniſters of the Council it ſelf to be ſupplied. In the diſpoſition of Benefices Eccleſiaſtick, he obliges the Queen to follow the judgment of the Cardinal</hi> Mazarine. <hi>He ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo, that</hi> Chaſteauneuf <hi>the</hi> Garde Seau, <hi>and the Dutcheſs of</hi> Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereuſe <hi>ſhould not be permitted to return into the Kingdom; and as to other Exiles and Priſoners, he leſt them to the diſpoſition of the Council.</hi> He wills, that this his Will ſhould be ſigned and ſworn to by the Queen and the Princes, and by the Parliament verified. The Queen having no party could not oppoſe it, though the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> declared himſelf in her favour, and at St. <hi>Germans,</hi> where the King lay ſick, Conventicles and Factions were formed.</p>
               <p>Every one perceived, that the favour not only continued to the dependents of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> but that the ſupreme Authority of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was by the King left to them, and <hi>Mazarine</hi> had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſhare; for, beſides the dependency of the Clergy, which with the diſtribution of benefices was made partial, either joyning with the three Miniſters, he had the majority of Votes, or ſtanding as a neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral betwixt the Queen and the others he made himſelf Arbiter to whatſoever ſide he inclined. Amidſt theſe commotions of affections and diſcourſes, the King with remarkable piety renders his Spirit to God upon the 10. of <hi>May,</hi> in the forty third year of his age, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving juſt upon that day compleated the thirtieth year of his Reign. Having by Arms enlarged the Power, the Renown, and Majeſty of his Kingdom, reformed it with good Laws, and dignified it with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Manners, he would certainly have been numbred among the Princes of greateſt fame, if to his praiſes the Glory of <hi>Richelieu</hi> had not been interpoſed, to whom the World aſcribed the counſels and ſucceſs. He lived and dyed without knowing to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Arts of Favourites; he was adorned with many Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, with Piety, Religion, and Juſtice; but ſuffered the exceeding great defects of his Miniſters. Though Hereſie were diſarmed in <hi>France,</hi> yet abroad it was countenanced and promoted. Himſelf ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in his Diet, in his Cloathing, and, except it were in Hunting, abſtaining from all ſorts of pleaſures, abandoned the wealth of his people in prey to the profuſion of Favourites. With the Title of <hi>Juſt</hi> he covered many ſevere examples, filled often the <hi>Baſtille</hi> with Innocents, and managed the Sword of the Hangman to the private revenge of his Confidents. The Brother was a Fugitive, and the Mother forced to fly. If then the Greatneſs of the Name of <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> obſcured in famous acts the Glory of <hi>Lewis,</hi> it alſo reſoued him from many blames, ſaving only that, that jealous and avaritious of his Authority towards his Kindred, he was ſuperfluouſly prodigal of it to his Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, who had not yet compleated the fifth year of his age, takes the name of King, and thereupon great Revolts were foretold, whilſt to the intern confuſions, which the Regency of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Woman, the novelty of Government, the affections of Miniſters, and the pretenſions and diſguſts of the malecontents point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, ſtranger Forces were quickly added, and the Army of <hi>Melo,</hi>
                  <pb n="553" facs="tcp:53750:283"/>
which conſiſting of ſeventeen thouſand Foot and ſeven or eight thouſand Horſe ſhewed it ſelf on the Frontiers to offer invitation and incouragement to them that ſhould attempt novelties. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving during the Kings ſickneſs waited ſome days without attempting any thing, reſolves at laſt to invade <hi>France</hi> to promote diſturbance more powerfully, with an aſſured hope to find no reſiſtance, and the King once dead, the Government would be turned topſie-turvy. The Army then with the increaſe of new Forces entring into <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſche,</hi> and laying waſte many places with Fire and Sword, beſieges <hi>Rocroy,</hi> a little place on the Frontiers of <hi>Champania,</hi> which alone he thought might hinder his march as far as <hi>Rheims,</hi> and from thence perhaps to <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Heaven, to ſay truth, ſhewed it ſelf very partial in this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to <hi>France;</hi> for if <hi>Melo,</hi> retarding his march, had maintained the credit of his Army, or if the thought of taking the place ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, he might have been able to advance towards <hi>Paris,</hi> to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance thoſe that were for him, and put the reſt in confuſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt out of the Sepulchre of <hi>Lewis</hi> would have been raiſed the Fortune of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Crown.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Enguien,</hi> Son of <hi>Conde,</hi> who ſcarce out of his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, commanded the Army in thoſe parts, aſſiſted with the Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>del' Hoſpital</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Gaſſion,</hi> upon notice of the Siege, ſpeedily aſſembles as many Troops as he could, which amounted not to more than fourteen thouſand Foot and ſix thouſand Horſe, and came near to the place, ſituate in a Plain, and environed with low Grounds and Woods. <hi>Melo,</hi> out of a perſwaſion to take it with eaſe, having only five unfiniſhed Baſtions with ſome Out-works and a ſcanty Garriſon, had thought a Circumvallation needleſs; which gave <hi>Gaſſion</hi> the means to thruſt into it, through the midſt of the Enemies Batalions, ſome men, with which the Garriſon being ſtrengthned makes a Sally, and recovering a Half-moon, gave time for the groſs, with which the Duke arrived upon it with ſo much reſolution, that ſhewed he would not refuſe a Battel. <hi>Melo,</hi> ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in Forces, rejoyced already in the Victory, and was ſo far from avoiding the ingagement, that he rather aſſured himſelf, that Fortune offered him that occaſion to ruine the obſtacle of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to his great deſigns. He removes from the Siege of <hi>Rocroy</hi> to range himſelf in order in the Plain and offer Battel; but he loſt an exceeding advantage: For <hi>Enguien</hi> not being able to diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Army ſo ſoon, from certain narrow paſſages betwixt the Wood and the Mooriſh grounds, was by the night ſurpriſed with his Troops divided, and <hi>Melo</hi> did not care to attacque him, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſtay for a Renfort under the Command of General <hi>Bech,</hi> who was coming with four thouſand men, and to overcome, as he boaſted, at one blow, not only a part, but all the Enemies. The <hi>French</hi> during the night quickly re-united themſelves, and the Chiefs receiving the advice of the Kings death, with expreſs order not to hazard in that conjuncture a Battel, kept it ſecret, not to take away courage from their own, nor increaſe confidence in the Enemy,
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:53750:284"/>
ſince they found themſelves ſo far advanced, that they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire either with ſafety or honour.</p>
               <p>The Army then was put into order, and <hi>Gaſſion</hi> with the right wing made choice of a place of ſuch advantage that he could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently attacque the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in flank. <hi>Melo</hi> with a redoubled errour not caring to ſtay any longer for <hi>Bech,</hi> for whom he had the evening before neglected the advantage to defeat one part of the Enemy, readily accepts the engagement, and in the beginning had the ſucceſs to rout and purſue all the left-wing, with the gaining of eight Cannons, taking Monſieur <hi>de la Ferté Seneterre</hi> Priſoner, and the wounding of Monſieur <hi>del Hoſpitall.</hi> This notwithſtanding <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi> with an undaunted courage played ſtill the part of a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſuggeſting to himſelf, if not from experience, at leaſt from his birth, the memorials and provocations of glory, reſtores the broken Troops to courage and order, and leads again thoſe that were moſt entire to the Fight. <hi>Gaſſion,</hi> with the natural fury of the <hi>French,</hi> ſhocks the left-wing of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in ſuch a manner, that the Cavalry could not withſtand him. The Duke of <hi>Albequerque</hi> was General of it, arrived to that degree by the favour of <hi>Melo,</hi> and he juſt, unmindful of the publick danger and his own honour, was the firſt that betook himſelf to flight; whereupon the reſt eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed him. <hi>Gaſſion</hi> then charges in the rear of the right wing, which being victorious, purſuing advantage, had ſcarce been put to a little ſtop by Monſieur <hi>de Scirot,</hi> who ſeaſonably with a body of reſerve was moving to encounter it. But feeling on a ſudden blows from behind them, turned aſide, and at laſt gave way totally. The Foot, which conſiſted of the beſt of the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Troops, made reſiſtance with the proof of great courage, as long as they were able. The Marqueſs <hi>de Fontaine,</hi> their General, having by the Gout the uſe of his Feet taken from him, died upon a Chair at the head of the Battailons, with a great number of Souldiers, whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were ſeen lying in ranks, ſo unmoveably had they kept their ſtation. Many flinging away their Arms, endeavoured to eſcape by flight, and amongſt thoſe <hi>Melo,</hi> after having given greater proof of courage than experience, flinging away his Truncheon of command ſaved himſelf not ſoftly. Five other Squadrons cloſing themſelves together withſtood a long time the charge of <hi>Gaſſion,</hi> reſolving not to part with their lives but at the price of a great deal of blood. But they abandoned and environed by the <hi>French,</hi> who at laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bring Cannon to overcome them, were forced to yield. The Priſoners were ſix thouſand, which with the Cannon, Baggage, and a great number of Colours, remained in the power of the <hi>French,</hi> who found of theirs not above two thouſand wanting. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi> warmed with the battel and fierce for the Victory, caſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the Enemy Country, not only recompenſing with burning the miſchief done in the <hi>Tiraſche,</hi> as hoping in that conſternation of minds for ſome great revolt. But the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> obſerving <hi>France</hi> alſo by the death of the King tottering, kept themſelves quiet. He applies therefore to more profitable Conqueſts, beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:53750:284"/>
                  <hi>Thionville,</hi> which, through the importance of the ſituation in <hi>Lutzemburg</hi> having been formerly attempted, after a bloody Siege was now rendred, and a while after, <hi>Sirch</hi> ran the ſame Fortune.</p>
               <p>The Queen in this interim, after the Husbands death, comes with her two Sons from St. <hi>Germans</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> amidſt long files of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Arms, and entring with the new King into the Parliament, <hi>Orleans,</hi> and <hi>Condé</hi> aſſiſting, expreſſes rather with tears than words, ſhewing the Sons as pledges of her affection, and the Kingdoms felicity, that nothing remained to her but Widowhood and tears. She referred to the Kings diſpoſition of the manner of the Regency, to which, <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Condé</hi> declared to have given their conſent only, not to defile with reluctancy and diſguſts the quiet of the Kings laſt breath. To many of the Parliament it ſelf, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed incapable of admiſſion, no leſs than new. Being therefore abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with unanimous Votes, the Regency remained decreed to the Mother of the King alone, with an abſolute power: Yet it is true, that to have the two above-mentioned Princes conſent to it, it was before concerted, that the Queen ſhould confirm them in the charges conferred by the King, and that the ſame Miniſters ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Council. As the firſt act of her authority, to the end to avoid any inteſtine over-turnings, the Queen recals the exiled, and ſets the <hi>Baſtille</hi> open; and to gain applauſe, ſhe beſtows charges and gifts upon thoſe ſhe knew ſhe could not wiſh better, publiſhing that her deſire was during her Regency to make appear all the virtue, but none of the defects of the paſt Government. To the Princes Confederates and Friends ſhe ſtedfaſtly affirms, that ſhe would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the alliances and affections of her Husband deceaſed. As to Miniſters of the Counſel, it quickly appeared, that ſhe deſired to bring into it perſons more in her own confidence. They were but few, and had out-lived the perſecutions of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> neglected, rather than preſerved, by reaſon of the opinion of their mean abilities: Wherefore (the others beginning to fear a fall) the Chancellor, to uphold himſelf, employs as much money as he could, and as much art as he knew, for the gaining of thoſe who being moſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with the Queen, ſhould remonſtrate on all occaſions to her his ability in employments, and the facility, with which he ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without reſerve to be bowed to the ſupreme will of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; a quality not to be deſpiſed in a new Regency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bottillier</hi> having the Keys of the Treaſury, as his Son managed the Pen of the ſecrets of State, having with ſuch eminent charges and immenſe riches provoked the hatred of the people and the envy of the Court, judged, it would be available for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reſt, to renounce the ſuperintendency, which was by the Queen divided betwixt the Preſident <hi>Bailleul,</hi> her Chancellor, and Monſieur <hi>d' Avo,</hi> both in the reputation of ſincere and diſ-intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed virtue. Nevertheleſs a while after, <hi>Chavigni</hi> alſo, under the title of ſale, was forced to yield up the Secretaryſhip of State to the Count <hi>de Brienne,</hi> a perſon of exemplary integrity, and of the Queens oldeſt Servants. To the charge of chief Miniſter, as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:53750:285"/>
to be diſpoſed of, as to be undertaken, becauſe confidence and capacity were in an equal degree requiſite; ſhe deſtines the Biſhop of <hi>Bovés,</hi> kept from Court by <hi>Richelieu</hi> as long as he lived: But he, being at firſt in the opinion of probity and ſufficiency, was no ſooner arrived at Court, but that in the darkneſs of ſo many affairs and intereſts, he found a new and obſcure element, and paſſing from a private to a publick life, he ſeemed like a River, which in its own Chanel running clear and quiet, when it enters into the Sea becomes troubled and fluctuant. He erred at firſt againſt his own fortune, by not removing <hi>Mazarine</hi> from Court, believing to keep him at his pleaſure to be informed and inſtructed by him. But he quickly came to know that the excellency of wit keeps predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy in all things and places. The Cardinal, in this eclipſe of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, abandoned by all thoſe, who a little before worſhipped him, is not amaſed, but, faining to accommodate himſelf to the time, with civil and ſubmiſs carriage moves compaſſion and affections, leaving the Biſhop to loſe himſelf in the weight of the affairs, or grow vain in the ambition of the place. The truth was, all thoſe that nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with him were diſpleaſed at his want of experience; but above all, the Miniſters of the League of <hi>Italy</hi> were offended with him; for, having with the favour aſſumed the ambition to adorn himſelf with the Purple, the King having obtained his nomination to the Cardinalat, he ſhewed himſelf moſt partial to the Court of <hi>Rome. Mazarine,</hi> ſeeing him tottering, began to abſent himſelf from Council, alledging that being excluded from his former Poſt, he could no more appear there; whereupon the Government was quickly ſenſible of the weakneſs and alteration of the Miniſters, and the Queen, more new in buſineſs than all, knew not what to counſel or reſolve.</p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but there appeared in the Queen a kind of inclination towards the Cardinal, at which the Biſhop taking jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie ſtirred up others alſo, who in his Government hoped to have a great ſhare, to form a party to diſcard him. Perceiving at laſt that he was not able to do it alone, it was publiſhed, that the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> would take upon him to kill the Cardinal, and Papers with ſharp invectives were ſcattered in the Apartments and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Cabinets of the Court. The Queen, moved at it, cauſed <hi>Beaufort</hi> to be arreſted Priſoner, and commands the Biſhop to retire to his Reſidence. The Dukes of <hi>Vandoſm</hi> and <hi>Mercure,</hi> Father and Brother of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> went out of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> left it alſo. Thus the Court changing face in a moment, gave <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine</hi> opportunity to eſtabliſh himſelf. In the want of other capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons, by the means of thoſe that took party with him, he cauſed it to be divulged, <hi>That the quality of a Stranger ought not to prejudice him, but was rather to be judged commodious for the common good, being neither obliged to the factions of the Princes, nor expoſed to the hatred of the great ones. That the Natives had kindred, riches, and parties, in which they were confident, either to find excuſes for their overſights, or pardon for their faults. That himſelf, deſtitute of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:53750:285"/>
could not hope for ſupport but in his innocency. That he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly expoſed himſelf to the hatred of the turbulent, being always ready to deliver the lovers of Peace out of troubles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All applauded theſe conceptions, ſome to beſpeak his favour and to advance him, others to expoſe him to the publick hatred, and to ruine him. And many, being not able to bear the ſuperiority of Equals, inclined rather to a Stranger. Thus the Cardinal ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a moment got up to that height of authority, to which <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> in the progreſs of many years ſcarce arrived with ſo many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, he as a Stranger governing that Kingdom, which having placed the glory of it in Arms, he had very often rejected the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the King, and not valued the fovour of his neareſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There was no difficulty in the Queens ſatisfaction, ſhe being new in Affairs and deſirous of Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Orleans</hi> weary of his baniſhments and of former troubles, of a Genius otherwiſe tractable, and now ſatisfied with the poſture wherein he was, and deſirous to be imployed in the Armies, was pleaſed with the ſubmiſſions and flatteries of <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with his ſatisfactions and money, and deſigned him the next year for the Command of the Army of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conde</hi> alſo ſetling after the doubtfulneſs of the Regency, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon heaping up wealth, and therefore a friend to Favourites from whom he received advantage, was at preſent content with his condition, the Cardinal, ſerving him to obtain of the Queen all that which his intereſts ſuggeſted him to pretend to. <hi>Anguien,</hi> his Son, who having haply taſted the firſt glory of War, breathed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Martial Genius, profeſſed himſelf bound to the new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, who deſtining him for the command of an Army, furniſhed him alſo with thoſe means for his ſubſiſtance, which his Fathers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony contributed ſcantily to him.</p>
               <p>For the reſt, the Great men finding themſelves without places and without Governments, the people exhauſted both in their Wealth and Blood, no body could oppoſe all rather applauded the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, who in this beginning made it his glory not to appropriate to himſelf Riches, Governments, or Honours, but labour and toil on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; with inflexible rigour to keep his Kindred far diſtant; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the Queens favours and benefits, and above all, truſting in his fidelity and the ſervices which he propoſed to render to the Crown, to deteſt any Defence and Guards, content with his own Houſe and the modeſty of a frugal Family.</p>
               <p>Such were the beginnings of his Government, in which increaſing always in favour, he was notwithſtanding acceptable to all. But Strangers could not believe this Miniſtry durable, or the Peace of the Kingdom laſting, yet it quickly appeared, that it was confirmed, nay rather increaſed in Dominion and Glory; Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity being ſo enlarged, that the change of the Miniſter, the death of the King, the government of a Child, and the direction of a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had no power at all to ſhake it.</p>
               <p>The Queen in theſe beginnings ſhewed a deſire to Peace, and the
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:53750:286"/>
Cardinal, to keep the people with thoſe hopes contented, cauſed Paſs-ports for the Miniſters of <hi>Spain</hi> to be diſpatched, and conſents that a beginning ſhould be given to the Meetings, for which the Pope deputed <hi>Fabio Chighi,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nardo,</hi> Nuntio at <hi>Collen,</hi> and the Republick diſpatched <hi>Luigi Contarini.</hi> But in <hi>Italy,</hi> amidſt the the conſiderations of foreign occurrences, the ſucceſſes of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Pontificial and Confederate were attentively obſerved. The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> with the Vote of the Commendator <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>golino Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foni,</hi> who in that Army aſſiſted for the Grand Duke, had reſolved to incamp in ſight of <hi>Caſtel Franco,</hi> though <hi>Corraro</hi> believed it more proper, that it ſhould have gone to <hi>Finale</hi> to incommodate the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rareſe,</hi> and keep it ſelf nearer to the Quarters of <hi>Parma,</hi> to the <hi>Po,</hi> and to the Territory of the Republick.</p>
               <p>Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> foreſeeing the march, ſends a great Party into the Mountains of the <hi>Modoneſe;</hi> ſo that the Duke was forced to follow it with his own men and two thouſand <hi>Venetian</hi> Foot, the reſt remaining at <hi>Buon Porto.</hi> He deſired afterwards, that that alſo might move, but <hi>Corraro</hi> denied it, becauſe the Duke had not made ſufficient proviſion of Victuals, nor had wherewithal to carry it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Army croſs the Mountain. The intention of <hi>Mathei</hi> being diſcovered, to keep the Confederates in motion and the imployment of their own defence, he on a ſudden goes out of the <hi>Modoneſe</hi> with the loſs but of one Company of Horſe, which was defeated by the Duke. <hi>Valanzé</hi> moved then with all the Army towards <hi>Finale</hi> and <hi>Bondeno,</hi> threatning to attacque ſome of thoſe Forts; and becauſe the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who had not done ought but force the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of four hundred Horſe at St. <hi>Pietro,</hi> was reduced to a very weak number of Foot, and not to above a thouſand Horſe, the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> reſolved to lend him ſome Troops to keep the Out-works of <hi>Bondeno. Corraro,</hi> who coaſted upon the Enemies march, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the Quarter of <hi>Campo Santo</hi> aſſaulted by <hi>Valanzé</hi> with three thouſand Foot and five hundred Horſe; but he withſtood and repulſed him. His Judgment was, that the Duke remaining to guard his own Confines, ſhould ſend him the two thouſand Foot of the Republick, which he had with him, that he might invade the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rareſe,</hi> with which he ſhould not only have diverted the Enemy from moleſting the Dukes Country; but the Poſts of Communication and the Banks of the River ſhould have been kept defended: a counſel, which event afterwards ſhewed, how advantagious it would have been. But the deſire prevailing in the Duke to enter into the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logneſe</hi> to draw the Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> after him, the March was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved on, having firſt ſtrengthned <hi>Finale</hi> with five hundred Foot more, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſent beyond the <hi>Po,</hi> that in the abſence of the Army, the Pontificians ſhould not attempt to exploit any thing to break the Communication and ſhut out the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Corraro</hi> then and the Duke having a mind to joyn, Cardinal <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio,</hi> that underſtood all their deſigns, cauſed, to the end to hinder them, <hi>Nonantola</hi> to be attacqued by four thouſand men. The place lyes beyond the <hi>Banaro</hi> without any defence of Fortifications, and
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:53750:286"/>
was then kept by the <hi>Venetians</hi> with two Companies under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel St. <hi>Martin,</hi> who reſolved whatever happened to defend the attacque and the Battery of two great Guns, to give time to the Duke, who was then at <hi>Modena,</hi> to come with his own and two thouſand Foot of the <hi>Venetians</hi> to its ſuccours. He coming to the Bridge of the <hi>Navicello,</hi> found it poſſeſſed by four Companies of Horſe; but driving them away, comes through to <hi>Nonantola,</hi> and obliges the Enemy to a Retreat. This being quickly done, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with returns, when in his way the Cardinal appeared to oppoſe him, and although the March had wearied the Souldiers, the Duke ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs reſolves to fight him. He ſcarce began to move, but the Pontificians betook themſelves to flight, in which being purſued with the death of ſome, and amongſt thoſe of <hi>Franceſco Gonzagha,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant Major General of the Army, the Cardinal, whoſe Horſe was killed under him, hardly eſcaped from being of the number of the Priſoners, which amounted to two hundred.</p>
               <p>The Confederates reſolved, demoliſhing <hi>Nonantola,</hi> not to ingage a Garriſon in ſo weak a place, to march to <hi>Spilimberto,</hi> whence they entred into the Territory of <hi>Bologna,</hi> plundering to the very Gates of the Town, to the damage and terrour of the Country. <hi>Piumazzo,</hi> abandoned by the Inhabitants, at the appearance of two hundred Foot and five hundred Horſe was poſſeſſed. The Baron <hi>de Deghen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelt,</hi> who commanded the Horſe of the Republick, had <hi>Bazano</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to him, and judging it not eaſie to be kept left it. But the Pontificians having brought three hundred men into it, moved the Confederates to repoſſeſs it, as was eaſily done, the Garriſon ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring on conditions, which were not obſerved, becauſe, contrary to the tenour of them, ſome certain powder was found amongſt the Baggage, whereupon being ſtript by the way, they were all made Priſoners.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Tuſcany, Savelli</hi> in this interim had recovered <hi>Paſſignano,</hi> cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Garriſon of two hundred men in pieces, keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander Priſoner, and afterwards attempted the City of <hi>la Pieve</hi> with a Petard, but without ſucceſs. The Confederates had taken <hi>Pacia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and the Grand Dukes Army conſiſting of eight thouſand Foot, fourteen hundred Horſe, and thirty pieces of Artillery, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in the Plain of <hi>Caſtiglione del Lago;</hi> gave ſo much terrour to <hi>Perugia,</hi> that the Prefect who was there thought himſelf not ſecure, and was doubtful of ſome commotion of the Inhabitants; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Savelli,</hi> drawing the Army under the Walls of it, durſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his quarters. The progreſs would certainly have been very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable alſo in the <hi>Bologneſe,</hi> as the Confederates deſigns were not ſmall, if Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> had not with a new ſprightly party over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown their counſels. He, ſeeing that on that ſide the ſtrength of the Army conſiſted in the Forces of the Republick, and to oblige it to call back their Troops for its own defence, cauſed thirteen Boats by night to be put into the <hi>Po,</hi> and haſtily imbarquing four hundred men upon them, ſends them a little below <hi>Lagoſcuro</hi> to take Poſt upon the Banks on this ſide of the River. Captain <hi>Tritonio,</hi>
                  <pb n="560" facs="tcp:53750:287"/>
who with a Company of Horſe was going the round, oppoſed them, but, being overpowered by the number, was forced to let them land. The <hi>Pontificians</hi> marched immediately to the ſame Poſt of <hi>Lagoſcuro,</hi> ill fortified, and worſe provided with men, and although Count <hi>Giovanni Battiſta Porto,</hi> and the Cavalier <hi>Mark Antonio Strozza</hi> valorouſly defended it for ſix hours, yet <hi>Valanzé</hi> being in this interim paſſed to this ſide with three thouſand Foot, fifteen hundred Horſe, and ſome Cannon, they were at laſt overcome and made Priſoners.</p>
               <p>At the firſt reports of the Enemies paſſage, the General <hi>Peſari</hi> ſends <hi>Mark Antonio Brancaccio</hi> with five hundred Foot to relieve the Poſt attacqued; but being come to <hi>Chiaviche,</hi> and there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it was taken, ſtopt, till the General himſelf, who was alſo marching, ſhould arrive. <hi>Peſari</hi> had not with him above eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Foot, and betwixt three and four hundred Horſe, the many Garriſons and frequent expeditions to the other ſide of the <hi>Po</hi> having leſſened his Forces. Having underſtood, that with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and ſafety of the Paſs the Enemy was every day more and more ſtrengthened, he reſolved to halt there, to expect reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, recalling from <hi>Finale</hi> the laſt five hundred Foot he had ſent thither, two Companies of Horſe from <hi>Mantua,</hi> and diſpatching or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and advice to all places, to defend the Country and increaſe the Forces. He conferred there with the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> deſiring him to join with him; but <hi>Edward;</hi> having but a very few men, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed that he ſhould expect the Army out of the <hi>Modeneſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this paſſing with great retardment, the interim ſerved the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificians</hi> to plant a good Fort there, juſt over againſt the other, which on the other ſide of the <hi>Po</hi> was alſo called by the name of <hi>Lagoſcuro.</hi> In the <hi>Poleſene,</hi> and in <hi>Rovigo,</hi> by reaſon of this paſſage, the fright was truly great; but the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> not willing to be ſhut up amidſt thoſe Ditches, contented themſelves with the advantage they had gotten, advancing only with ſome incurſions as far as <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino</hi> and <hi>Fieſſo.</hi> The Senate, troubled at this accident, ſends four hundred Souldiers in Garriſon to <hi>Rovigo,</hi> and <hi>Michele Priuli,</hi> Prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor of the <hi>Terra firma,</hi> came ſeaſonably thither to re-animate the minds of the Inhabitants. He over and above commands, that four thouſand of the Trained Band ſhould be aſſembled, that they might trouble the Enemy from the Confines of <hi>Loreo;</hi> and that <hi>Lorenzo Marcello,</hi> Proveditor of the Fleet, ſhould come with a good Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron into thoſe waters. The moſt ready ſuccours depended upon recalling <hi>Corraro,</hi> to whom the General had diſpatched orders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, leaving the Duke two thouſand Souldiers. Although the matter of ſelf-defence admitted not of conſultations, nevertheleſs in the conſult of that Army it was reſolved, abandoning the <hi>Bologneſe</hi> to return to the <hi>Po,</hi> the Duke ſeeming contented to retain four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred only of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Souldiers. The Confederates, having their march at ſeveral Paſſes interrupted by the Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> arrive at <hi>Bondeno,</hi> and there among the <hi>Venetians</hi> themſelves were diverſities of opinions. For <hi>Corraro</hi> approved the going to the other
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:53750:287"/>
ſide of the <hi>Po,</hi> there to make diverſion, and at the ſame time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque both the Forts of <hi>Lagoſcuro.</hi> But <hi>Peſari</hi> ſuſtaining that the Forces were not ſo ſtrong that they might with ſafety be divided, and fearing leſt the Fort of <hi>Figarolo</hi> ſhould be aſſaulted, orders that the Army ſhould paſs over, which was executed with ſome ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by reaſon of the diverſity of opinions; concerning which, not without ſome contention of minds, each of the Chiefs were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give the Senate information, which referred it ſelf to the Conſult and to the plurality of the Votes of thoſe to whom it was committed that were upon the place. <hi>Peſari</hi> advances with the whole Army in ſight of <hi>Lago-Scuro,</hi> and in the viewing of it, met with a thouſand Horſe divided into ſeven Squadrons that were eaſily repulſed; nor was there other encounter, the Pontificians within their Fortifications not being to be forced, nor was it their intereſt to ſally forth, not to expoſe to a doubtful event that great advantage of the Poſt, which was ſo ſerviceable for their preſervation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> whom it equally concerned not to give battel, not to leave, in caſe of a ſiniſter accident, in prey to the Enemy a Country of ſo great importance, and lying in ſuch ſort open, that it could not be preſerved but with an Army, went to <hi>Fieſſo</hi> to fix a Quarter there, and with the Fort of <hi>Figarolo</hi> of one ſide, and the <hi>Poleſella</hi> on the other, they thought to ſtraigthen the Enemy, and keep their own Country covered. Nevertheleſs, not to abandon the Duke of <hi>Modona,</hi> two thouſand men were ſent back to him, that he might infeſt the <hi>Ferrareſe</hi> and defend his own Country. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate little ſatisfied with theſe reſolutions, and leſs with the ſucceſſes, made choice for Proveditor in the Camp of <hi>Priuli</hi> and <hi>Corraro,</hi> which formerly were, the one in <hi>Terra firma;</hi> and the other in the <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe;</hi> and into the Generalat ſubſtitutes <hi>Marco Juſtiniani</hi> Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, calling home <hi>Peſari</hi> to clear himſelf of ſeveral negligences which were imputed to him; of which things, being better underſtood, he was afterwards abſolved, and a few years after aſſumed to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of the Republick. <hi>Juſtiniani,</hi> being arrived at the Army, had a Meeting with the Dukes of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> to which laſt ſome re-inforcement of men being come to him out of his own Country; and it was reſolved, that the General ſending ſome other Souldiery beyond the <hi>Po,</hi> at the ſame time ſhould be attacqued the two Forts of <hi>Lago Scuro.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conference was ſcarce ſeparated, but the Duke, contrary to what was reſolved, demands ſo many men and ſo many proviſions as left the General without Forces to act what on his ſide was agreed. He of <hi>Modena</hi> laid afterwards the fault on <hi>Edward,</hi> as having a mind not to do any thing at all. Then, although <hi>Juſtiniani</hi> offered fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Foot more, the Dukes with ſeveral excuſes delaying to reſolve, perhaps that knowing the enterpriſe to be in truth diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, they had no mind to hazard their Honour and then Troops; yet he comes before the Fort, dividing his Quarters, his own with <hi>Gonzagha</hi> above, the other of <hi>Priuli</hi> and <hi>Valette,</hi> a little below. On the other ſide of the River was Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> with the whole
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:53750:288"/>
Army of thirteen thouſand men, and notwithſtanding the Batteries of the <hi>Venetians</hi> from the Dikes, had, at leaſt by night, convenient paſſage to relieve it, nay oftentimes aſſaulted the Quarters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though his attempts were always repulſed. The moſt ſignal Faction was, that a Souldier <hi>Corſo</hi> having by flight out of the Camp of the <hi>Venetians</hi> carried the Word to the Enemies, they, three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtrong, commanded by Count <hi>Frederico Mirogli,</hi> came, and by night aſſaulted the Generals Quarter. The Alarm being given, <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zagha</hi> haſtes to it, and the Aggreſſors were beaten back with loſs. Many were drowned in the <hi>Po;</hi> eighty were taken Priſoners, and amongſt them <hi>Mirogli</hi> with ſome few wounded. But this was not done without ſome hurt to the <hi>Venetians;</hi> for on that ſide were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Carrucci,</hi> a gallant Colonel of <hi>Croats</hi> and <hi>Albaneſe; Colonſa,</hi> their Serjeant Major, beſides two Captains, and <hi>Cupis</hi> an Ingeneer.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this advantage, the General perceived, that by the facility of the paſſage and of the ſuccours, the Enemy received, the enterpriſe could not be carried through; thereupon drawing all his men into one Quarter, he retires to <hi>Poazzo</hi> in good order. <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uli</hi> being ſick, a while after dyes, and to him was ſurrogated <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Veniero,</hi> who upon the Confines of <hi>Loreo</hi> ſupplied the place of <hi>Delfino,</hi> who was alſo indiſpoſed. Before he came into the <hi>Poleſene,</hi> he had ſeveral times hindred the Pontificians to paſs to this ſide the River; and now ſending ſome Troops to the other ſide, attacques in <hi>Cologna</hi> a Quarter of three hundred men, and firing the Town with the death of ninety, brought away fifty Priſoners beſides. Nine Gallies alſo and two Galliaſſes with the Proveditor of the Fleet ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at Sea, incommodating the Commerce of the Subjects of the Church; but nothing of note hapned, but that in paſſing by ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Sinigaglia,</hi> a Cannon ſhot took away the life of <hi>Thomaſo Contarini,</hi> Captain of one of the Galliaſſes, a perſon young in years, but in affairs of the Sea of the higheſt expectation. But the ſeaſon not ſerving longer for it, little could be done by the Confederates at Sea; they only ordered re-inforcement for the year to come, and becauſe the Pope in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> calling the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> to joyn with his, had obliged thoſe of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> to retire, the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> offered the Grand Duke, their Gallies not being accuſtomed to that Navigation, to arm at a common charge ſome great Veſſels, and in the approaching <hi>Campania</hi> to trouble the Enemy on that ſide alſo.</p>
               <p>In this interim the Revenues of the <hi>Malteſians</hi> in the Dominions of the Princes United were ſequeſtred, notwithſtanding thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers would have excuſed themſelves, as not having been able to deny to ſerve the Pope their Soveraign. The ſucceſſes in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> fully compenſated thoſe leſs happy on the other ſide; for although the Grand Duke, a little indiſpoſed, was retired to <hi>Florence,</hi> and that <hi>Monterchio</hi> was poſſeſſed by the Pontificians, nevertheleſs the heat of the Armies not cooling, the Enemy was beaten off from St. <hi>Caſciano;</hi> and <hi>Paſſignano</hi> was recovered by the Confederates. <hi>La Magione,</hi> a rich Abby belonging to Cardinal <hi>Anthonio,</hi> was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:53750:288"/>
and a certain Wall of great concernment broken down, which holding up the waters in the <hi>Chiani</hi> to the prejudice of <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> diverted them from the <hi>Tevere,</hi> where formerly having their courſe, they were the cauſe of Inundations and great miſchiefs to <hi>Rome. Monte Cotognola</hi> was alſo forced, the Garriſon of ſome hundreds of Souldiers remaining Priſoners. The four hundred Horſe, <hi>viz.</hi> three hundred of the <hi>Venetians</hi> under <hi>Girolamo Tadini,</hi> and a hundred of the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> after ſome delay, by reaſon of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the <hi>Po,</hi> arrived at laſt in <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> and ſome Souldiers of the <hi>French</hi> Levies began to diſ-imbark at <hi>Ligorn;</hi> wherewith the Army taking vigour gave no ſmall apprehenſion to <hi>Perugia.</hi> To di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it, <hi>Vincenza della Marra,</hi> Knight of <hi>Malta, Neopolitan,</hi> and Mareſhal General of the Field, <hi>Savelli</hi> by reaſon of indiſpoſition being reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, deſigning an Incurſion into <hi>Tuſcani,</hi> and the ſurpriſe of the City of <hi>Pieve,</hi> was upon his march thither with three thouſand Foot, eight hundred Horſe, and four pieces of Cannon. But meeting with the Prince <hi>Matthias,</hi> who croſſed him in his way, alted upon the Hill <hi>della Madonna di Mongiovino,</hi> playing with his Cannon upon the Princes Vantguard; but they being obliged to double their ſteps, ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another Eminence, from whence he ſo galled the Pontificians, that they, abandoning the firſt Poſt, endeavoured to get up upon a higher point of the ſame Hill. Being then cloſely purſued, and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelio Malvaſia,</hi> Lieutenant General of the Cavalry, running away with two hundred Horſe, the reſt remained at the diſcretion of the Confederates. <hi>Marra</hi> retiring with a few into a certain Caſtle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defence, ſeeing himſelf beſet, renders himſelf Priſoner with four Colonels, ſeventy Officers of ſeveral qualifications and about a thouſand Souldiers, leaving all their Colours and the Cannon with all other Proviſions in the hands of the Conquerours. <hi>Monterchio</hi> was hereupon recovered; <hi>Caſtel Leone</hi> with <hi>Piegaio</hi> taken; <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere</hi> and the Mills of <hi>Perugia</hi> battered.</p>
               <p>But a new Army was quickly ſet on Foot conſiſting of ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and ſeventeen Companies of Horſe, under the Command of the Commendator <hi>Nari</hi> and of <hi>Tobia Pallavicino,</hi> to execute the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the <hi>Barberins</hi> to aſſault the Grand Duke in ſeveral parts, whilſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> reduced to their own defence, they had their Forces leſs ingaged, and the Grand Duke having not lent his ear to particular Treaties, ſeveral times propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to him, to the end to ſeparate him from the League; they had hopes either to give him a blow with their Army, or for fear to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to an accord, and afterwards with all their force to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Venetians.</hi> The attacques in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> were to be made in three places; at <hi>Petigliano</hi> with the new Army from the <hi>Perugino;</hi> at <hi>Piſtoia</hi> by the way of the Mountains with that of the <hi>Bologneſe;</hi> and laſtly <hi>Monſieur de Codré Monpenſier,</hi> General of <hi>Romagna,</hi> towards the City <hi>del Sole,</hi> and that part of the Dominion, which beyond the <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine</hi> belongs to the Grand Duke, which, as expoſed and weak, was alſo ill guarded. They contrived at the ſame time to ſend into the Country of <hi>Parma</hi> the Count <hi>de St. Secondo,</hi> who pretended to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:53750:289"/>
himſelf of certain places belonging to the Houſe of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Colonel <hi>Garnier,</hi> who without obſervation levied men upon the Lands of <hi>Buzzolo</hi> and in the <hi>Mantuan.</hi> Three hundred Horſe alſo, wading the <hi>Panaro,</hi> were by the Plains of the <hi>Modeneſe</hi> to be ſent by the Cardinal <hi>Anthonio</hi> to thoſe parts, with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance that they might do great miſchief, and raiſe confuſion in the Country. The Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> having got notice of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, deſired no better but that the ſaid Horſe ſhould be ſuffered to paſs the River, that then from convenient places they might be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and cut to pieces. In oppoſition to this, he of <hi>Parma,</hi> who with very weak Forces kept himſelf at <hi>Bondeno,</hi> thought it better to imploy effectual offices at <hi>Milan</hi> and at <hi>Mantua,</hi> to the end, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, a ſtop might be put to the Levies of St. <hi>Secondo</hi> and <hi>Garnier.</hi> But <hi>Valanzé</hi> marching againſt <hi>Tuſcany</hi> with four thouſand Foot and a thouſand Horſe by the way of <hi>Poretta,</hi> came upon <hi>Piſtoia</hi> ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, that the Great Duke had not time to thruſt ſuccours into it. Nevertheleſs the Town, though weak, by the courage of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants and ſome few Souldiers repulſed the Scalade, which <hi>Valanzé</hi> attempted, who fruſtrated of his chief deſign, contented himſelf to do ſome ſpoil in the Country round about, and with the gain of four Cannon, which he found by the way. If the poſſeſſing of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoia</hi> had ſucceeded, the Pontificians intention was to advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Florence,</hi> and, with the terrour of Fire and Sword moving mens minds and crying liberty, to have attempted to incenſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. There was in truth great fear within the City, that had not for a long time been accuſtomed to feel an Enemy ſo near; but the news of the ſucceſs quickly quieted their hearts, and the Grand Duke, to ſhew confidence, put Arms into the peoples hands, which the <hi>Medici,</hi> during their Government, had not till now hazarded to do. The Prince <hi>Matthias</hi> haſted with four thouſand men to the greater need; but leaving the <hi>Seneſe</hi> expoſed, the <hi>Barberins</hi> attac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued it alſo from that ſide.</p>
               <p>The Grand Duke demanded ſuccours of the Confederates, and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> though with much apprehenſion they remained fixed in the preſervation of the <hi>Poleſene,</hi> ſent to the other ſide of the <hi>Po</hi> two thouſand five hundred Foot more and three hundred Horſe with <hi>Veniero</hi> and <hi>Valette,</hi> to joyn with the others of their men to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Enemy. Duke <hi>Edward</hi> ſhewed a deſire to go to the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Grand Duke, and without believing to obtain it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded four thouſand Foot and a thouſand Horſe of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who not much ſatisfied with his lying idle, thought it better to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their own Officers, exhorting him to trouble the Enemy in that interim in the <hi>Ferrareſe.</hi> But he not ſtirring, the Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> joyns to five thouſand men of the <hi>Venetians</hi> a thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot of his own and eight hundred Horſe, ſending them by the way of the Mountains into the Reer of <hi>Valanzé.</hi> The Marqueſs <hi>Colombino, Modeneſe,</hi> pillaged <hi>Rocca Cornetta;</hi> the Count <hi>Raimondo Montecuculi</hi> forced <hi>Vergato,</hi> defended by two hundred Foot and ſix hundred Peaſants. <hi>Valette</hi> having defeated a Company of Horſe,
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:53750:289"/>
plundered to the Gates of <hi>Caſtel Franco,</hi> and as far as <hi>Bologna. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zano</hi> was retaken with the death of one hundred and fifty Foot and ſixty Dragoons that kept it, but the Count of <hi>Montecuculi</hi> was there hurt. <hi>Montevia, Serravalle,</hi> and other walled Caſtles, where the people had put their Goods for ſafety, were in like manner ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The Commander <hi>Panzetta</hi> with part of the Garriſon of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> ſurpriſed <hi>Crevalcuore,</hi> a great place, cutting to pieces the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of about three hundred; but the Souldiers, for plunder having neglected the Guards, <hi>Codre Monpenſier</hi> enters into it, taking <hi>Panzet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> himſelf Priſoner, and killing fifty men with a Captain of Horſe, whilſt the reſt ſaved themſelves by flight.</p>
               <p>By the motion of the Confederates with ſuch ſucceſs, <hi>Codre</hi> was diverted from the thought of attempting the City <hi>del Sole,</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanzé</hi> perceiving the deſign to cut off his way, with the loſs of ſome men in the Mountain retired into the <hi>Bologneſe.</hi> The Great Duke now had the liberty to imploy all his Forces on the other ſide, where Cardinal <hi>Barberino,</hi> come into <hi>Aqua-pendente,</hi> had ſent <hi>Tobia Pallevicino</hi> towards <hi>Burgo St. Sepulcro</hi> with five thouſand men. The Governour of the place ſallying forth with two Companies of Horſe, cut to pieces a Party of three hundred with their Commander, whereupon the groſs withdrew; but not long after <hi>Ceſare delli Oddi,</hi> Commiſſary General of the Horſe, beſieges <hi>Pitigliano,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paccioli</hi> aſſiſting in the Army. The attacque was for ſixteen days withſtood by the Colonel <hi>Griſoni,</hi> who with eight hundred men commanded within it. At laſt the Prince <hi>Matthias</hi> marching that way, <hi>Strozzi,</hi> Serjeant Major General <hi>de Battaille,</hi> preventing them, puts himſelf into the field with two thouſand Foot and ſix hundred Horſe aſſembled in haſte, and from <hi>Sorano</hi> advancing to <hi>Caſone,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques a great Party of the Pontificians which were plundering in that Quarter. He had the good fortune to beat and diſſipate it with ſo great a fright to the reſt, that a Pannick fear entring into the Camp, the Siege was raiſed with great confuſion and a direct run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away. <hi>Strozzi</hi> purſuing this terrified Army diſperſed a good part of it. Cardinal <hi>Rapaccioli</hi> was not ſlow in ſaving himſelf. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berino,</hi> who was upon his way from <hi>Rome</hi> to go animate the Army with his preſence, failed but little of being taken Priſoner. Eight pieces of Ordnance, four Petards, with many Colours, and all the Military proviſions remained in prey to the Conquerours. The Commander of the <hi>Caſtel Ottieri</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> ſeized upon <hi>Montorio,</hi> and the Pontificians, who had newly gained <hi>Monterchio,</hi> abandoned it, totally diſ-incumbring the Dominions of the Grand Duke. The ſeaſon proper for the action of Armies ending with this ſucceſs, of equal honour and advantage, the Troops were diſtributed into Quarters, and thoſe of the Confederates being about <hi>la Fratta, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia Pallavicine,</hi> going inconſiderately out of the place, was taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide the Count <hi>dal Maeſtro</hi> Serjeant Major General <hi>de Battallie,</hi> fell into the hands of the Pontificians, who in that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter recovered <hi>Val di Neſtore</hi> during the Winter. In <hi>Poleſine</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:53750:290"/>
Rains falling in extraordinary abundance, had very ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hindred action there, the Country being low and dirty. The Enemy remained only incommodated by the <hi>Venetians</hi> by way of the Sea, and by <hi>Delfino</hi> were defeated at <hi>la Garda</hi> one hundred and fifty Foot and as many Horſe, and by <hi>Anthonio Grimani alla Zocca</hi> four Companies of Dragoons, burning the Country round about. <hi>Veniero</hi> lodged with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Troops in the <hi>Modeneſe</hi> at <hi>Spilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berto,</hi> and the <hi>Pontificians</hi> with three Cannons came in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to attacque him. <hi>Valetta,</hi> not truſting himſelf in the quarter but weakly fortified, goes forth with the Cavalry to meet them, and, being ſeconded by five hundred Foot, obliged them to retire. After that by the direction of a Company of <hi>Croats,</hi> come from the ſervice of the <hi>Barberins</hi> to that of the Republick, he attacqued by night the quarter of <hi>Caſtel Franco,</hi> where defeating two Companies, ſome Horſes were brought away. The roughneſs of the Winter hindred at laſt every where even the ſmalleſt occaſions, giving way, that with more quiet of mind applications might be made for a Treaty, which amidſt the management of Arms had not been intermitted: For <hi>Alexandro,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Bichi,</hi> ſent by the Crown of <hi>France</hi> to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate, being arrived in <hi>Italy,</hi> perſwades the Pope and the Princes Confederate to nominate Plenipotentiaries, to meet and treat of Peace; and thereto were appointed by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Donghi;</hi> by the <hi>Venetians, Giovanni Nani</hi> Cavalier and Procurator; by the Grand Duke, <hi>il Gondi,</hi> and by the Duke of <hi>Modena, il Teſti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A difficulty preſently roſe about the place; for <hi>Donghi</hi> demanding, that, to ſhew ſome reſpect to the Pope, the meeting might be held in his Dominion, the Confederates diſſented from it, to the end not to let it appear, that other intereſt was there to be managed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the private of the <hi>Barberine</hi> Family, with whom (ſaving the obedience to the holy See) they profeſſed to have the conteſt. It was then propoſed to call it in a neutral place, and particularly in the <hi>Mantuano;</hi> and when the Emperour named the Prince <hi>de Bozzolo,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Albornos,</hi> to meet there; <hi>Bichi,</hi> who deſired that the merit might be aſcribed only to <hi>France</hi> and to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, let fall the propoſition: But going into the <hi>Modeneſe,</hi> propoſes in writing to the Dukes of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Modena,</hi> and to the Provedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Corraro: That the abſolution and the pardon for</hi> Edward <hi>ſhould be asked by others; that his Country ſhould be reſtored, the rights of the Montiſts remaining as before.</hi> He, over and above, offers his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with the mediation of the Crown, the better to diſcover the truth of their intentions, whether the Confederates pretended ought elſe. To the Grand Duke, beſides theſe propoſitions, he glances at a ſuſpenſion of Arms. He then propoſes to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſhew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Pope, and aſſure himſelf of the intentions of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, not having found at <hi>Bologna</hi> in <hi>Donghi</hi> that extent of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which was judged neceſſary. In effect <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> diſcovered to be not only inclined but deſirous of Peace; for, burdened with his age, and weary of the cares War carries with it, though his Kinſman
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:53750:290"/>
concealed from him the things that were moſt grievous, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed the informations of matter of fact, yet the clamours of the people for ſo many devaſtations came to his ears, and he began to be ſenſible of loſing his own, out of a deſire to retain that which was anothers. He therefore conſents to a Treaty, with the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> and prays the Cardinal to haſten the concluſion of it, that he might enjoy peace in that little reſidue of life which he had yet to live. In <hi>Barberino Bichi</hi> found wonted obſtinacy; for it being at that time, when with the paſſage of the <hi>Po</hi> he thought to have put the <hi>Ferrareſe</hi> out of danger, and that he intended an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion into <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> he ſought all evaſions; ſo that, to fruſtrate the propoſitions of <hi>Bichi,</hi> he cauſes to be inſinuated to the Emperour the depoſiting of <hi>Castro</hi> in his hand, and the <hi>Austrians</hi> were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed with it, that ſo their name and the Imperial authority might be interpoſed in the Treaty, and to exclude the <hi>French</hi> from the Negotiation and the depoſition it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But the Princes of the League, always more jealous from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of propoſitions, kept their intentions ſecret, reſolving not as yet to expreſs, whether with the alone preſervation of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of <hi>Parma</hi> they would remain contented. The deſigns of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berino</hi> againſt <hi>Tuſcany</hi> vaniſhing at laſt with diſhonour and loſs, the Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> comes alſo to <hi>Rome,</hi> to require many things that were wanting, which could not be ſupplied but with great charge. He alſo gives account of the ſtate of the Army, and of the neceſſity of reinforcement; he declares the burden which the State bore for quarters; the groans of the ſubjects for the deſolation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the difficulty either to recover what was loſt, or in making Conqueſts upon the Confederates. The congregation therefore of State, expreſly ſet on foot for the diſcuſſions of ſuch Affairs, ſiding with the Pope, concluded that <hi>Caſtro</hi> was to be reſtored to the Duke <hi>Edward.</hi> Cardinal <hi>Barberino</hi> could now no longer withſtand the common inclination, though he ſaw, that, with the reſtitution of <hi>Caſtro,</hi> a diſhonourable Peace was to be the conſequence of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy War. Nevertheleſs, the Pope retracting the offer of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition made to the Imperialiſts, as if it had rather been a caſual diſcourſe than an expreſs propoſition, a Writing was delivered to <hi>Bichi</hi> with a promiſe of the ſaid reſtitution. If with this alone the Confederates would be ſatisfied, was as yet very doubtful; for thoſe of <hi>Modena</hi> in the Aſſemblies at <hi>Venice</hi> preſſed, that, if not their rights upon <hi>Ferrara,</hi> at leaſt thoſe of <hi>Comaccio</hi> might be protected by the League in favour of the Duke. The <hi>Venetians</hi> judged it beſt not to inſiſt upon ought elſe but the intereſts of <hi>Parma;</hi> but not to expreſs themſelves in it, till the intentions of <hi>Barberin</hi> in that point ſhould be more fully declared, to the end that ſecured from further troubles, the Treaty might have no new diſturbance. But the Grand Duke, who felt the burden of the War to be heavy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to Cardinal <hi>Bichi,</hi> who in his way from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Florence;</hi> that ſaving his own rights and ancient intereſts, the Confederates would be ſatisfied with the redintegration of the Duke

of <hi>Parma.</hi> Upon the arrival of the Cardinal at <hi>Venice,</hi> thither came the Dukes of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Gondi</hi> and <hi>Teſti</hi> were already there, debating with <hi>Nani</hi> and <hi>Guſſoni,</hi> whom the Senate had again deputed for that purpoſe, not only the propoſitions of Peace, but proceeded by anticipation upon the concert of Arms, in caſe the Treaty ſhould come to nothing; ſo that to remedy thoſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, which the diviſion of Forces had been the cauſe of in the laſt Campagnia, it was deſigned to make up together a body of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Foot, and ſix thouſand Horſe, and joining into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſixteen thouſand of the one, and four thouſand of the other, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one with the reſt keeping his own Frontiers, it was reſolved to make an attempt upon <hi>Romagna,</hi> a Country abounding with Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, that had not many ſtrong places, and whereinto the Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once entred might receive Proviſions and Recruits by Sea.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe the <hi>Venetians</hi> having reſolved to increaſe their Fleet with ſixteen Gallies, offered to employ it to ſecond the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings by Land, and proffered money to the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> to provide himſelf with Souldiers to execute the concerts on his ſide alſo. The greateſt and moſt effectual difficulty herein conſiſted in the raiſing of men; for, although the Republick had given out orders for many Leavies, not only in their own dominion in <hi>Italy</hi> and in that beyond the Sea, but in <hi>Germany</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining amongſt others in their ſervice <hi>Giles d' Has,</hi> a Commander of much repute, on condition to levy three thouſand <hi>Germans;</hi> yet the diligence of the <hi>Pontificians,</hi> to hinder the effecting of it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in many places; ſo that ſome of the <hi>Cantons</hi> of the <hi>Swizzers,</hi> ſtirred up by the Nuntio, openly hindred the paſſages, and the <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> denied them to make their market of them.</p>
               <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> ſecretly alſo croſſed them, doubtful, leſt the remainder of the <hi>Weimarians,</hi> running to the new Levy, ſhould totally disband. On the other ſide, expreſly to ruine that Army, the Arch-Dutcheſs <hi>Claudia</hi> of <hi>Insbruch,</hi> at the entreaty of <hi>Luigi Contarini</hi> Cavalier, in his way to the meeting at <hi>Munſter,</hi> open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ways of <hi>Tirol,</hi> and <hi>Girolamo Cavazza,</hi> Secretary, at laſt agrees for thoſe of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> with the recognition of a certain ſum of money; the Biſhop of <hi>Coire</hi> co-operating therein, though ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatned by the <hi>Barberins.</hi> The Pope, burdening his Subjects with many Impoſts, the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> furniſhing ready money upon them, and by taking a great ſum out of the Caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> of that, which had been laid up by his Predeceſſors for War againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels and other the moſt urgent occaſions, was ſufficiently provided of money: So that Souldiers flocked to him, invited by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of pay, and a good many alſo came out of the Province of <hi>Avig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and out of <hi>France,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi> ſecretly conſenting to it, who, ſeeing <hi>

               <p>Such Conteſts, which without profit equally endammaged the Princes, and ruined the People, made way at laſt to the good of the Peace; which if it ſeemed more neceſſary than honourable to the <hi>Barberins,</hi> was of no leſs profit and glory to the Confederates. <hi>Bichi,</hi> arriving at the very end of the year paſt at <hi>Venice,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately propoſes, that the abſolution and pardon ſhould be demanded by <hi>France</hi> for Duke <hi>Edward,</hi> and that <hi>Caſtro</hi> ſhould be reſtored to him; reſtoring only to the Church what was poſſeſſed by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, and the rights of the Montiſts remaining as before; and becauſe he obſerved the greateſt difficulty to lye in the diſtruſt, which the Confederates had of the intentions of the <hi>Barberins</hi> in executing that which ſhould be agreed, he offers the word of <hi>France,</hi> with a declaration and promiſe, that their Arms ſhould be employed againſt him that ſhould fail in the execution of the Agreement.</p>
               <p>Though the Grand Duke had declared himſelf to be contented with <hi>Caſtro;</hi> nevertheleſs, in the meetings at <hi>Venice, Gondi</hi> inſiſted, that the <hi>Pontificians</hi> might by the Treaty be prohibited to repair the ruined Wall, which holding up the waters in the <hi>Chiani</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the Country of <hi>Siena.</hi> But by the <hi>Venetians</hi> was given him to underſtand, that promoting the intereſts of one of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, there would be a neceſſity to open a gate in the Treaty for the others alſo, to the rendring it more tedious and difficult. The Grand Duke thereupon deſiſted, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> razing thoſe Forts poſſeſſed by them near <hi>Loreo,</hi> provided in ſome meaſure on that ſide againſt the diſturbance which reſulted from thence on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Miniſters bore with great impatience to be excluded from this Treaty, and the Emperours Ambaſſador ſhews in <hi>Venice</hi> a Plenipotence to aſſiſt at the meetings; but the Confederates eaſily excuſed it: For, the conditions of Peace being by the <hi>Barberins</hi> put into the hand of the <hi>French</hi> Mediator, they could not but lend their ear to him, that brought more ample and the ſecureſt propoſitions. The Treaty therefore went on, although ſome millitary accidents interpoſed; for the <hi>Venetians</hi> had contrived the ſurpriſe of the Fort of <hi>Lagoſcuro</hi> on the other ſide of the <hi>Po;</hi> but by unceſſant rains for three whole days the ways being overflowed, the deſign was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and Cardinal <hi>Antonio</hi> having got the Wind of it, ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus the Garriſon, and for fear of intelligence changes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. <hi>Marino Badoaro</hi> alſo from <hi>Figarolo</hi> attempts that of that other Fort on this ſide; but ſome few Souldiers, coming like labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to poſſeſs it, being diſcovered, the others that followed were conſtrained to retire. <hi>Giacomo Riva</hi> had ſucceſs in beating up the quarters of the <hi>Pontificians</hi> at <hi>Zecca,</hi> and the armed Barques of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> after ſome conteſt, carried away from <hi>Premiero</hi> ſome Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels laden with Corn.</p>
               <p>To make themſelves amends for theſe inſults, the <hi>Pontificians</hi>

aſſaulted a quarter of the <hi>Venetians</hi> at <hi>Schienta;</hi> but being repulſed and purſued by <hi>Giovanni Paulo Gradenigo,</hi> Paymaſter in the field, and by <hi>la Valetta,</hi> the encounter grew hot near to <hi>Lagoſcuro</hi> on the other ſide of the River, and ended in the flight and loſs of the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors; ſo that the Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> who ſallying out of <hi>Ferrara</hi> attempted to countenance the faction, was hardly able to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the ſwiftneſs of his Horſe, leaving more than a hundred of his men dead upon the place, and about an hundred and fifty Priſoners, amongſt which were the Vice Legate of <hi>Ferrara, Caraſſa, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio Doria</hi> Governour of that Fort, and other Officers and <hi>French</hi> Captains The death, if it had hapned, of <hi>

The Confederates, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſuch an accident, which could not paſs without great revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in the Dominions of the Church, and in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> would open to them a way to many advantages, were not againſt it, by reaſon of that reſpect which they profeſſed towards the holy See, and becauſe, with the death of the Pope, the authority alſo of the Nephews expiring, thoſe motives would fall to the ground, which had been the cauſe of taking Arms.</p>
               <p>Nay the Grand Duke upon the firſt notice of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbans</hi> ſickneſs, which was thought deadly, diſpatches Letters to the Cardinal <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talto,</hi> in the which juſtifying his intentions to the future Conclave, offers himſelf to interpoſe with the other Princes for the conſenting to a Truce.</p>
               <p>The Senate alſo wrote to Cardinal <hi>Bragadino,</hi> requiring him by proviſion, if there ſhould be a vacancy in the See, to aſſure the Conclave of their upright intentions for Peace; but it was in truth believed, that the Grand Duke had been tranſported too far, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating his endeavours, and offering that, of which the League had not as yet been deſired by the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Wherefore he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing the ſpeed of his diſpatch with the doubt, that the Popes life would not have laſted ſo many days, as were requiſite to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the judgments of others, recalls his orders to <hi>Montalto,</hi> and leaves the inſtances of Cardinal <hi>Bichi</hi> to be conſulted of in the wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſſemblies in <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> remonſtrates the fit conjuncture to revenge themſelves of the <hi>Barberins,</hi> to attempt Conqueſts, and by the means of them to ſecure Peace. The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> ſhews alſo the opportunity which was opened for advantages, but fell back notwithſtanding, as at laſt <hi>Edward</hi> alſo did, to more wholſom counſels; ſo that it was concluded, <hi>That the Truce ſhould be accepted during the vacancy of the See, and ſome certain days after the election of a new Pope; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided nevertheleſs it ſhould be deſired in the name of the Conclave, and that in that interim a Letter ſhould be written to the Cardinals in the name of all the League, to juſtifie the neceſſity of their paſt reſolutions, to inform them of their intentions tending to Peace, and to offer all their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the ſecurity and liberty of the ſaid Conclave.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="571" facs="tcp:53750:292"/>But as they were ready to ſend their anſwer to <hi>Bichi,</hi> the notice of the Popes recovering induces them, omitting further Treaty of a Truce, to haſten the concluſion of a Peace. The Articles propoſed by the Cardinal had in ſeveral Aſſemblies been ventilated, where rejecting ſome, and correcting others, they were at laſt concluded by the common conſent of the Confederates; and the Cardinal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a mind to carry them with all ſpeed to <hi>Rome,</hi> was received in all places of the Eccleſiaſtick State with the acclamations and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the people longing for Peace. Nor in approving of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was there any difficulty made by the Pope or his Nephews, by whom were only altered ſome few words, but of no importance. Paſſing then with the ſame diligence through <hi>Florence,</hi> he returns to <hi>Venice</hi> with the Treaty ſigned by <hi>Donghi,</hi> and with his Powers, in which the Confederates having deſired ſome amendment in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, no difficulty was made. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> refuſed to admit the Treaty in other form than that agreed at <hi>Venice;</hi> but he was by the League given to know, that there being an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſubſtance, and the few words changed at <hi>Rome</hi> not altering it at all, the end being accompliſhed for which the Princes had uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, when the Powers of <hi>Donghi</hi> ſhould be received in the form de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, their intention was to proceed to the concluſion, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his conſent. With this proteſt, and a Voyage, Cardinal <hi>Bichi</hi> made to <hi>Parma</hi> to render him that reſpect, which was the thing he aimed at, he alſo was perſwaded to approve it. So that it was ſubſcribed in <hi>Venice</hi> for <hi>France</hi> by the Cardinal <hi>Bichi;</hi> for the Republick by <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni Nani</hi> Cavalier and Procurator; by the Cavalier <hi>Giovanni Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſta Gondi</hi> for the Grand Duke; and for <hi>Modena</hi> by the Marqueſs <hi>Hippolito Eſtenſe Taſſoni,</hi> in whom the Plenipotence appeared to be.</p>
               <p>The Capitulations were divided; the one agreed by <hi>France</hi> with the Pope, in that which concerned the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who, for the obſervance of what was promiſed, had given a Writing to the ſaid King; the other concluded immediately betwixt the Pope and the Confederates. In the firſt, ſome wonted expreſſions being premiſed concerning the Popes zeal to Peace, <hi>The King beſought him for abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pardon for</hi> Edward. <hi>That ſo the Excommunication being taken off from his Dominion, he might be reſtored into the favour of</hi> Urban, <hi>deſired by the Duke himſelf with the humility which was expedient. Then ſixty days after the Ratifications</hi> Edward <hi>was to retire out of the</hi> Stella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta <hi>and</hi> Bondeno, <hi>the Fortifications being demoliſhed; and</hi> Caſtro <hi>was to be rendred by the Pope with every thing confiſcated and poſſeſſed, the Fortifications alſo to be razed, and the Ammunition and Arms, any where introduced, to be reciprocally withdrawn. To the</hi> Montiſts <hi>remained their Rights as before the War. Priſoners were reſtored, and thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned which had ſerved on either ſide, the Duke obliging himſelf to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm, Garriſons neceſſary for his Country being excepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this, as hath been ſaid, paſſed betwixt the Pope and the King, who by conſent of the Pope himſelf promiſed to imploy his Arms againſt him that on his ſide ſhould fail in performing the things promiſed. The other Capitulation, correlative to the above-ſaid, and
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:53750:293"/>
ſubſcribed the ſame day, declared, <hi>The Confederates to have taken Arms for no other cauſe but for the redintegration of Duke</hi> Edward, <hi>firm as to other things in their moſt conſtant obedience towards the Pope and the Holy See; it was agreed after the ſubſcribing to ſuſpend Hoſtility, and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Princes promiſed, the Ratifications being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, to retire their Forces within their own Confines, leaving only neceſſary Garriſons in the places poſſeſſed, and them alſo after ſixty days to quit, the Fortifications being demoliſhed, the Ammunition and Arms belonging to them being withdrawn. It was reciprocally agreed to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh within each others Country the Fortifications towards the others Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, which had been raiſed by the occaſion of this War, giving each to other the Liſt of thoſe he pretended ſhould be razed, and having the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſend Miniſters to ſee it executed. Betwixt the State Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and</hi> Tuſcany <hi>not any novelty of moment having happened, all was left in the condition things were at preſent, the Controverſie of the</hi> Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni <hi>being referred to the ancient Capitulations betwixt the Pope and the Grand Duke. To the perſons and places which had ſerved or had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves to the other Party pardon was granted, the Duke of</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia <hi>being expreſly named; and Priſoners were ſet at liberty; the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons, who had withdrawn themſelves, having permiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and the Sequeſtration of the Rents of the Knights of</hi> Malta <hi>being taken off.

For the execution of all this, Hoſtages were given to the King of</hi> France, <hi>and the King to the ſatisfaction of the Pope and of the Confederates declared, that his Arms ſhould be in favour of him that executed the accord, and againſt thoſe that obſerved it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Powers of <hi>Donghi</hi> being come, adjuſted to the ſatisfaction of the Confederates, the Peace upon the firſt day of <hi>May</hi> was publiſhed with a publick Maſs in the Church of St. <hi>Mark</hi> at <hi>Venice.</hi> The Hoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, delivered at <hi>Caſal,</hi> were for the Pope the Count <hi>Frederick Mirogli,</hi> for the <hi>Venetians, Ridolfo Sbrogliavacca,</hi> both Serjeant Majors <hi>de Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taille,</hi> the Commendator <hi>Grifoni</hi> for the Grand Duke, and for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>Taſſoni.</hi>

The entire execution of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was by common conſent prolonged for thirty days, becauſe the work of demolitions required a greater time and labour than had been ſuppoſed, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> lent Pioneers for that of <hi>Bondeno</hi> and that of the <hi>Stellata,</hi> Duke <hi>Edward</hi> taking little care for them, as places far diſtant from his Countries. And yet there hapned a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; for it being pretended by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> that ſome Works about <hi>Comacchio</hi> ſhould be ſlighted, the Pontificians refuſed to do it, as of a place not ſo near the Frontiers, not without ſuſpicion that they from thence ſought to put a ſtop to the Peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="573" facs="tcp:53750:293"/>But the Republick, to take away all pretext, conſents, that they ſhould proceed in the reſt, leaving this point undecided, being ready to refer it to the interpretation of the King of <hi>France</hi> as Mediator of the Peace. Thus <hi>Caſtro</hi> was rendred, and the accord on all ſides executed, to the great commendation of the Cardinal <hi>Bichi,</hi> who in the Mediation confirmed the opinion of his no leſs dexterity than wiſdom. The Senate cauſed moſt ample thanks to be rendred to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> for its interpoſition by their Ambaſſadour in Ordinary, <hi>Battiſta Nani,</hi> Author of the preſent Hiſtory, Son and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew of <hi>Giovanni</hi> and <hi>Battiſta,</hi> both Brothers, by reaſon of many Imployments frequently mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Grand Duke ſent thither a Gentleman of his expreſs; and the World from this particular adjuſtment of <hi>Italy</hi> conceived good Preſages of the general one of the Crowns; to the end that Wars after ſo many years continuance ceaſing, the felicity of Peace might at laſt reign every where with a bleſſing.</p>
